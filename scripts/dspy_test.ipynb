Working Together to Reduce Waste\\nIn a blog about how people share, it’s worth the occasional reference to the bizarre ways that people DON’T SHARE. Is it safe to say we live in a society that places great value on independence, private property, personal space, and privacy? Even sometimes extreme value? Is that why people at an 8-unit apartment building in Oakland, CA have separate caged stalls for eight separate trash cans? I know it’s not nice to stare, but I walked by these incarcerated cans and could not help myself. I returned with my camera, so that I could share my question with the world: Why can’t people share trash cans or a single dumpster? Or, at the very least, why can’t the cans share driveway space?\\nThe Zero Waste Movement has come to the Bay Area and it calls for a new use for these eight cages. Here are my suggestions:\\n- Turn two of those cages into compost bins. Fill one with grass, leaves, and vegetable scraps, let it decompose for six months, then start filling the second bin in the meantime.\\n- Put in a green can, which is what Oakland uses to collect milk cartons, pizza boxes, yard trimmings, and all food to send it to the municipal composting facility. If your city doesn’t do this yet, tell them it’s a great idea and they could be as cool and cutting edge as Oakland.\\n- Put in one or two recycling cans for glass, plastic, cardboard, paper, aluminum, etc.\\n- Put out a FREE STUFF box for unwanted clothing and household items. The neighbors could sort through it each week, and later put it out on the curb for passers-by to explore. Take what’s left to Goodwill or a comparable donation spot.\\n- Put in a few small bins for various items that can be recycled, such asbatteries and electronics, which can then be taken to an electronics recycling center every month or two. Styrofoam can be brought to a local packaging store or ceramics business that accepts used packaging material. Or, if you accumulate a bunch of plastic bags,take them to a store or to some other place that accepts used ones.\\n- Put in ONE trash can. By the time you compost, recycle, re-use, redistribute, and take a few other measures to reduce your waste, you’ll have almost no trash each week.\\n- Install a bicycle rack or locked bicycle cage.\\n- With the leftover space, put in a container garden and a bench where neighbors can gather and chat. A much more pleasant alternative to the garbage can jailhouse ambiance, wouldn’t you agree?', 'general_descriptors': ['Informative tone', 'Community-focused', 'Environmental emphasis', 'Practical suggestions', 'Lengthy blog post', 'Conversational language', 'Personal anecdote', 'Civic engagement', 'Proactive solutions', 'Takeaway action items'], 'specific_descriptors': [\"Title: 'Free the Cans!'\", 'Reference to sharing behaviors', 'Critique of societal values', 'Observation of trash can storage', 'Use of imagery (caged stalls)', 'Questioning sharing norms', 'Introduction of the Zero Waste Movement', 'Suggestions for transforming trash can cages', 'List format of suggestions', 'Emphasizing composting process', 'Mention of municipal composting', 'Call to action for civic involvement', 'Discussion of recycling options', 'Advocacy for a FREE STUFF box', 'Inclusion of electronic recycling', 'Proposing alternatives to trash', 'Suggesting garden and gathering space', 'Contrast of garbage vs. community space']} with <function quality_metric at 0x7ffd41bcc0d0> due to 'dict' object has no attribute 'inputs'.\n",

Okay?? Please?\\nLook, D, you had two months to say to Harvard in private emails, \"Im sorry, I shouldnt have been using that animation in my paid presentations. I wont use it again. I really do like \\'Inner Life\\', though, and would love to use it in classroom presentations, from the BioVisions site, if that is acceptable.\"\\nI sat here, for two months, waiting for that to happen, anything to happen, and it didnt. Two months, on your own terms, you could have written a similar post to yesterdays. I would have given you the benefit of the doubt-- maybe you didnt know the credits werent visible to the audience, and I wouldnt have said a word beyond this, as its Harvards problem, not mine. This would have been a funny joke to those of us involved in dealing with you people, but it would have been a PR non-issue for you.\\nBut after you set yourself on fire, you didnt douse it out with a bucket of ice cold reality and accountability. You ran. And youre still running.\\nWhy not just state \"I screwed up. Sorry everyone.\" and move on? Why the excuses? Why the denial? Why the passive language? Why the vague words and cryptic capitalizations? Why the writes and rewrites of your \\'press release\\'? We know it wasnt written of your own volition, or it would have been done *before* Harvard had to take action. And, your behavior before this, regarding this issue, is not indicative of someone who made an innocent mistake. Its weird.\\nSo what with this frantic running? Is the inability to say \"I was wrong\" a pathological feature of Creationists? Or are you hiding something? Or is it both? Or is it more?\\nAnd now we get Casey weighing in on the issue, according to cre8id at AboveTopSecret.com-- PBS/NOVA online - Intelligent Design on trial:\\n...to my knowledge, Discovery Institute has neither authorized nor received nor is making use of any presentation that used that animation. We have had nothing to do with creating or selling a DVD of that animation, nor do we have anything to do with placing that presentation on Google Video.I dont know what he is talking about with that last part, but the first part sounds similar to DIs claims post-Dover (\"WE HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH DOVER!\"). Maybe Luskin is telling the truth. Maybe this was a magic non-science Creation-friendly narration with convenient edits that AiG or ICR would have killed for... but only Dembski could find it... but he cant tell us where... and he didnt share it with anyone... and its subsequently disappeared from the Internet...\\nBut that simply isnt what Ive been told. Maybe this was all a silly Dembski mistake, blown out of proportion due to his decision to remain silent...

But on Tuesday it was announced that it will have its final curtain at the Palace theatre in New York on 8 December. That will be its 29th performance; the musical also had 24 previews before opening.\n",

In the week ending 17 November, it drew a gross of $374,371 with an overall attendance of 5,732 (63% of capacity). New York’s critics were less impressed than London’s by the Rupert Goold production. In her review, the New York Times’s Elisabeth Vincentelli called Tammy Faye “strangely bland” considering its larger-than-life subject matter. Variety’s Frank Rizzo said it was a “misguided West End import”.\n",

The married evangelists found fame in the 1970s through their television network, PTL (Praise the Lord). Faye was known for her singing voice, abundant emotion and extravagant makeup; a 2021 biopic starring Jessica Chastain was called The Eyes of Tammy Faye.\n",

    "The musical charts her rise to fame, a series of scandals and the backlash against her advocacy for gay rights. In 1985, Faye raised awareness of HIV and Aids through a famous interview with Steve Pieters, a gay church pastor living with HIV. “She won me over when she did that,” Elton John told ABC News last month. Her allyship was “pretty remarkable for someone in the religious community,” John added.\n",
