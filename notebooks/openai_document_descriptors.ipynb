Okay?? Please?\\nLook, D, you had two months to say to Harvard in private emails, \"Im sorry, I shouldnt have been using that animation in my paid presentations. I wont use it again. I really do like \\'Inner Life\\', though, and would love to use it in classroom presentations, from the BioVisions site, if that is acceptable.\"\\nI sat here, for two months, waiting for that to happen, anything to happen, and it didnt. Two months, on your own terms, you could have written a similar post to yesterdays. I would have given you the benefit of the doubt-- maybe you didnt know the credits werent visible to the audience, and I wouldnt have said a word beyond this, as its Harvards problem, not mine. This would have been a funny joke to those of us involved in dealing with you people, but it would have been a PR non-issue for you.\\nBut after you set yourself on fire, you didnt douse it out with a bucket of ice cold reality and accountability. You ran. And youre still running.\\nWhy not just state \"I screwed up. Sorry everyone.\" and move on? Why the excuses? Why the denial? Why the passive language? Why the vague words and cryptic capitalizations? Why the writes and rewrites of your \\'press release\\'? We know it wasnt written of your own volition, or it would have been done *before* Harvard had to take action. And, your behavior before this, regarding this issue, is not indicative of someone who made an innocent mistake. Its weird.\\nSo what with this frantic running? Is the inability to say \"I was wrong\" a pathological feature of Creationists? Or are you hiding something? Or is it both? Or is it more?\\nAnd now we get Casey weighing in on the issue, according to cre8id at AboveTopSecret.com-- PBS/NOVA online - Intelligent Design on trial:\\n...to my knowledge, Discovery Institute has neither authorized nor received nor is making use of any presentation that used that animation. We have had nothing to do with creating or selling a DVD of that animation, nor do we have anything to do with placing that presentation on Google Video.I dont know what he is talking about with that last part, but the first part sounds similar to DIs claims post-Dover (\"WE HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH DOVER!\"). Maybe Luskin is telling the truth. Maybe this was a magic non-science Creation-friendly narration with convenient edits that AiG or ICR would have killed for... but only Dembski could find it... but he cant tell us where... and he didnt share it with anyone... and its subsequently disappeared from the Internet...\\nBut that simply isnt what Ive been told. Maybe this was all a silly Dembski mistake, blown out of proportion due to his decision to remain silent... But what if we find more videos of more DI fellows, presenting this animation?\\n*shrug* If youve set yourself on fire, do not run, DI. If youve done it, better admit it to Harvard now, apologize, and move on.'}]\n",

Working Together to Reduce Waste\\nIn a blog about how people share, it’s worth the occasional reference to the bizarre ways that people DON’T SHARE. Is it safe to say we live in a society that places great value on independence, private property, personal space, and privacy? Even sometimes extreme value? Is that why people at an 8-unit apartment building in Oakland, CA have separate caged stalls for eight separate trash cans? I know it’s not nice to stare, but I walked by these incarcerated cans and could not help myself. I returned with my camera, so that I could share my question with the world: Why can’t people share trash cans or a single dumpster? Or, at the very least, why can’t the cans share driveway space?\\nThe Zero Waste Movement has come to the Bay Area and it calls for a new use for these eight cages. Here are my suggestions:\\n- Turn two of those cages into compost bins. Fill one with grass, leaves, and vegetable scraps, let it decompose for six months, then start filling the second bin in the meantime.\\n- Put in a green can, which is what Oakland uses to collect milk cartons, pizza boxes, yard trimmings, and all food to send it to the municipal composting facility. If your city doesn’t do this yet, tell them it’s a great idea and they could be as cool and cutting edge as Oakland.\\n- Put in one or two recycling cans for glass, plastic, cardboard, paper, aluminum, etc.\\n- Put out a FREE STUFF box for unwanted clothing and household items. The neighbors could sort through it each week, and later put it out on the curb for passers-by to explore. Take what’s left to Goodwill or a comparable donation spot.\\n- Put in a few small bins for various items that can be recycled, such asbatteries and electronics, which can then be taken to an electronics recycling center every month or two. Styrofoam can be brought to a local packaging store or ceramics business that accepts used packaging material. Or, if you accumulate a bunch of plastic bags,take them to a store or to some other place that accepts used ones.\\n- Put in ONE trash can. By the time you compost, recycle, re-use, redistribute, and take a few other measures to reduce your waste, you’ll have almost no trash each week.\\n- Install a bicycle rack or locked bicycle cage.\\n- With the leftover space, put in a container garden and a bench where neighbors can gather and chat. A much more pleasant alternative to the garbage can jailhouse ambiance, wouldn’t you agree?'}]\n",

The exchange's retail membership represents 85% of U.S. grocery volume — including 21 of the 24 largest supermarket chains based in the United States — but it still lacks key suppliers, especially in the fresh food sectors, said Pat Walsh, senior vice president, industry relations, education and research for Food Marketing Institute, Arlington, Va.\\n“We have good penetration [among manufacturers] on the dry grocery side — though it needs to be better — and need to expand in other fresh food verticals like meat, produce, deli and bakery,” said Walsh, who participated in a session on the RRE at the U Connect Live conference here earlier this month.\\nMajor food distributors in the exchange, including Kroger, Wegmans and Wakefern, have recently sent letters to their vendors explaining that the only way they will accept recall information is via the RRE, noted Brian Lynch, senior director of business and industry development for the Grocery Manufacturers Association, Washington, who also participated in the U Connect Live session. In an April letter posted on www.rapidrecallexchange.org, Kroger asked all of its suppliers to subscribe to the exchange by July 1.\\nMichael Roberson, director of corporate quality assurance for Publix Super Markets, Lakeland, Fla., said in the U Connect Live session that the chain is “disappointed” in the number of manufacturers using the Rapid Recall Exchange.\\n“Only 222 of our grocery suppliers are signed up, and more than 1,000 have not yet joined,” Roberson said. “We need to have the entire food industry collaborating on the Rapid Recall Exchange.”\\nLast year, of the 300 recalls Publix experienced, fewer than 50 went through the RRE, he said, adding that industrywide only 15% of recalls were submitted to the RRE. A total of 65 recalls have been issued through the exchange industrywide since its September 2009 launch.\\nFor recalls that went through the RRE at Publix, Roberson observed “the absolute excellence in the information that was communicated,” including product GTINs (global trade identification numbers), the reason for the recall, and photos. “If we get this information from our trading partners using RRE, then we eliminate most of the [internal] steps because everything works together through this tool,” he said. By contrast, for recalls that don't go through the RRE, “nine times out of 10 we're going back to trading partners and seeking out additional information.”\\nPublix has been proactive in urging manufacturers to join the exchange, Roberson said. In addition, Publix has expanded its supplier scorecard to monitor and rank suppliers on whether they leverage the RRE.\\nThe RRE was created by FMI and GS1 US, Lawrenceville, N.J., which will be issuing a new version of the exchange, 2.3, in August.\"}]\n",

The unemployment rate has steadily declined to its current 8.6%. And jobless claims have plummeted to 187,000.\\nWhen the unemployment rate drops, so does the federal support for administering benefits. Without those funds, Michigan will have to let go of the temporary workers, as well as 225 permanent staffers, totaling about one-fifth of the Department of Licensing and Regulatory Affairs\\' staff.\\n\"Unfortunately for them, the economy has gotten better,\" said Mario Morrow, spokesman for the department. \"It\\'s a good news/bad news situation.\"\\nMichigan is not the only state laying off or reassigning workers who staffed unemployment benefits call centers and processed claims. With the economy recovering, about half the nation\\'s states are dealing with reduced federal funding, forcing them to make staffing changes.\\nAlso, President Obama\\'s 2009 stimulus act doled out even more money to help cover states\\' increased unemployment benefits caseloads. But those funds have pretty much dried up.\\nSo even states where the jobless rates are still high are forced to make changes.\\nIn California, which has the nation\\'s third-highest unemployment rate at 10.7%, the state has shifted unemployment workers to disability insurance and tax processing after losing federal support.\\nRhode Island, meanwhile, laid off 65 workers, most of them on temporary assignment, after running out of stimulus funds. This comes even as the state still battles a 10.9% unemployment rate, the second-highest in the nation.\\nThe state would need $4.6 million to keep them on for another year, said Laura Hart, spokeswoman for the Department of Labor and Training.\\n|Apple set for showdown on Capitol Hill over corporate taxes|\\n|Tesla\\'s fight with America\\'s car dealers|\\n|Why I\\'m protesting against Gap over Bangladesh|\\n|The biggest merger you didn\\'t hear about today|\\n|Overnight Avg Rate||Latest||Change||Last Week|\\n|30 yr fixed||3.67%||3.62%|\\n|15 yr fixed||2.80%||2.76%|\\n|30 yr refi||3.65%||3.61%|\\n|15 yr refi||2.80%||2.76%|\\nToday\\'s featured rates:\\n|Latest Report||Next Update|\\n|Home prices||Aug 28|\\n|Consumer confidence||Aug 28|\\n|Manufacturing (ISM)||Sept 4|\\n|Inflation (CPI)||Sept 14|\\n|Retail sales||Sept 14|'}]\n",

Now, you have to throw the quarterback into the mix as well. After redshirt freshman Taylor Martinez gashed Western Kentucky for 127 yards and three touchdowns on just seven carries last Saturday, the Huskers' ground attack became even more dangerous that it already was to begin with.\\nConsidering NU faces an Idaho defense that gave up 148 rushing yards to I-AA North Dakota last week, Martinez and backs Roy Helu, Rex Burkhead and Dontrayevous Robinson should once again put up some big numbers on the ground this week.\\nNU Pass Offense vs UI Pass Defense\\nWith Martinez getting the start once again today, it will be interesting to see if he's able to do a little more through the air against a Vandal defense that ranked 116th nationally in pass defense last season. Last week, Martinez completed some nice passes, but he also got away with some risky throws that arguably should have been picked off.\\nIdaho held North Dakota to just 122 passing yards and picked off two passes last week, but then again, it was against North Dakota. Nebraska's wide receivers will be some of the biggest the Vandals' secondary will face all season, and there's really no reason why the Huskers can't be a little more aggressive against such a physically inferior defensive backfield.\\nUI Rush Offense vs NU Rush Defense\\nThe 155 yards and a touchdown Western Kentucky's Bobby Rainey put up against Nebraska last week were definitely reasons for concern, especially considering NU didn't give up that many yards against any of the talented backs it faced all last season. However, the players and coaches have insisted Rainey's big day was more a result of communication and alignment issues on their part and not because they were physically beaten up front.\\nThe good news for the Husker defense is that Idaho doesn't present nearly the challenge WKU was in the run game. Sure, they rushed for nearly 150 yards and three touchdowns against UND, but the Vandals still lost four starting offensive linemen from last season, and their pass-first mentality doesn't necessarily do much for the running game either. Also, word is that sophomore Eric Martin will get the start at linebacker over Alonzo Whaley, so NU should be even more physical against the run.\\nUI Pass Offense vs NU Pass Defense\\nIf there's one area where Nebraska should genuinely be concerned about going into today's game, it's how they're going to handle Idaho's explosive passing attack led by quarterback Nathan Enderle. The Huskers' secondary is considered one of the biggest strengths of the defense, but it certainly wasn't tested much at all last week.\\nThat definitely won't be the case today, as there's no doubt that the Vandals will come out slinging the ball all over the place. Enderle and Co. passed for 399 yards and three touchdowns last week, but the passing game definitely wasn't perfect. North Dakota racked up four sacks in the first half alone and also added an interception.\\nSpecial Teams, What If's and The X-Factor\\nAs usual, Nebraska gets the edge on special teams primarily because of senior kicker/punter Alex Henery and punt returner Niles Paul. Henery didn't really have to do much last week, and Paul came oh-so-close to breaking a couple of punt returns. In addition, kickoff specialist Adi Kunalic and kickoff returner Tim Marlowe did excellent jobs. Kunalic put two kickoffs into the end zone for touchbacks, and Marlowe averaged 34.5 yards per return. Idaho return man Justin Veltung is a threat on kick returns, but Kunalic should be able to make him a non-factor.\\nNebraska Will Win If:\\nIt continues to dominate in the run game and finds a way to put pressure on Enderle all game. Though Idaho's offensive line weighs in at an average of roughly 340 pounds, Nebraska's defensive line is much faster and more athletic, and it should be able to put some serious heat on Enderle and at least throw him off his rhythm. And if Martinez pulls off another performance like he did last week, then it's pretty much game over right there.\\nIdaho Will Win If:\\nIt can force Nebraska to pass the ball and create some turnovers while also putting up some points through the air. Enderle is one of the better quarterbacks in the country right now, and if he can get enough time in the pocket to go through his reads he should be able to find some holes in NU's coverage, especially considering the inexperience at linebacker and safety.\\nThere's no question that the one element Nebraska has that Idaho doesn't is a natural playmaker like Martinez. What he lacks in experience and his sometimes questionable decision making he more than makes up for with the ability to score every time he takes a snap. Add in Idaho's recent defensive struggles, and Martinez could be in for another highlight reel performance, which will only further separate himself from the rest of the pack as clear cut starter at quarterback.\"}]\n",

The two most prominent headwinds relate to revenue, namely the imposition of state sales taxes on Amazon e-commerce revenue and the large increase in federal taxes impacting consumer demand. There is another additional key headwind that is rarely discussed in relation to Amazon, but has and will continue to have a significant impact on operating income - the price of gasoline. While it should be no surprise that gasoline impacts shipping costs, this article enables the reader to accurately predict the impact of gasoline price changes on gross margin, operating income and earnings per share.\\nWhile Amazon is quite stingy in the investment information it releases to investors (missing are tablet units, impact of sales tax, streaming users, 3P total merchandise value, AWS COGS, etc…), they do let us know their gross and net shipping expenses. Figure 1 charts gross shipping expense as a percentage of e-commerce revenue against average US gasoline prices in the quarter (regular unleaded, average of all formulations and areas). The chart illustrates that shipping expense had increased steadily from about 7.5% of revenue to 8.6% - 8.9% during 2012. This occurred while Amazon was spending billions of capital on tens of new fulfillment centers closer to the customer to reduce shipping expenses. In order to understand this divergence, I dug a little deeper to determine what is driving the much faster than revenue increases in shipping expense even as shipping distances are being reduced.\\nFigure 1: Amazon Gross Shipping Cost as a % of E-Commerce Revenue and Average US Gasoline Prices\\nThrough regression analysis of Amazon and government data, I built a shipping expense growth model that demonstrates high correlation to two obvious independent variables: The price of gasoline and what Amazon refers to as \"Paid Units Sold\" (Amazon defines \"Paid Units Sold\" as \"physical and digital units sold\" that \"are paid units and do not include units associated with certain acquisitions, rental businesses, web services or advertising businesses, or Amazon gift certificates\"). The Coefficient of Determination (R2) of this regression was a convincing 0.98, displaying that these two variables alone account for the variation in shipping expense growth. As a note, I thought paid unit growth of 1P units only would be a better predictor as not all 3P units are shipped by Amazon, but the total paid units had a better R2, so I stuck with that.\\nWhat does the Statistical Analysis Tell Us?\\nHere is the key takeaway: Every 2% increase in gasoline price reduces Amazon\\'s overall gross margin by 10 basis points (BPS). At $16 billion in revenue, every 10 bps of margin reduction results in a $16 million reduction in operating income, or about 2.5¢ in earnings per share reduction. While 10 bps may not sound like a lot, 2.5¢ represents 28% of the analysts $0.09 consensus estimate for Q1. So a minor 2% shift up in gasoline costs can shift earnings lower by 28% in Q1.\\nLet\\'s look at this in the wider context of future earnings potential. Amazon bulls like to point to 2009 Q4 as a shining example of Amazon profit potential as they achieved 4.0% net margin and $0.85 per share of earnings. They claim that once all of the current investments subside, Amazon will either return to or exceed those peak margin levels on much higher revenue. Here is a dose of reality for the bulls: If gasoline prices per gallon in 2009 Q4 were what it is today, Amazon would have earned a measly $0.02 per share instead of $0.85! That means given today\\'s energy environment Amazon faces nearly 4.0% net margin headwinds from its prior peak performance.\\nHas The Fulfillment Center Build Out Strategy Had Any Positive Impact At All?\\nThere is one other interesting result of the analysis to note: the model generated an additive constant term of negative 8.8%. That means that with zero unit growth and no gasoline price change, Amazon shipping expense would shrink by 8.8% Y/Y. This is the positive impact of the distributed fulfillment center strategy and is already baked into the current numbers - you just can\\'t see it in Amazon\\'s financial results due to higher gasoline prices and much higher unit shipments than revenue growth over the past four years. The end result is that although Amazon management recognized they need to do something to stem these two major headwinds, they have only lost ground. While they have increased fulfillment expense as a percentage of revenue by 270 bps, shipping expense has increased 120 bps as a percentage of revenue, thus reducing net margin by 400 bps over the past four years. Based on these trends it seems Amazon will need to continue to invest heavily in fulfillment expenses over the next several years just to return to 2009 shipping expense percentage levels of e-commerce revenue.\\nIs There Hope For Gasoline Prices to Return to 2009 Levels?\\nThis is highly unlikely as the global financial crisis scared the energy markets into a severe dip (60% drop) at the end of 2008/early 2009. Gasoline prices have begun an exponential run up over the past few weeks and have well surpassed both the prior quarter and year ago quarter\\'s level seven weeks into the quarter (Figure 2). Oil prices tend to lead gasoline prices by 4 to 6 weeks, so look for gasoline prices to continue to rise significantly into the end of Q1 to near all-time high levels ($4.11/gal) as oil continues to print new 9-month highs. That could mean all time high shipping expense as a percentage of e-commerce revenue for Amazon in Q2. The current White House Administration\\'s tough policy approach on fossil fuels coupled with the Fed\\'s QE infinity program should continue to pressure oil prices higher through at least 2015, leading me to wonder why Amazon is considered a \"risk-on\" trade with its strong inverse earnings sensitivity to oil prices. Not only does an increase in gasoline cost increase Amazon\\'s shipping expense, it also lowers consumer\\'s discretionary income, thus providing an additional headwind to revenue - a true double whammy.\\nFigure 2: Weekly US Gasoline Prices for Q/Q and Y/Y Comparisons\\nCore to Amazon\\'s value proposition is the convenience of shipping product directly to your door. That service currently reduces operating margin by 870 bps (up from 750 bps three years ago) and is directly correlated to the cost of gasoline. For every 2% increase in gasoline cost, Amazon gross margin declines by 10 bps. This relation has reduced Amazon net margin by 400 bps to zero over the last four years. While spending billions on new distributed fulfillment centers has attempted to reduce the impact of soaring gasoline prices, shipping expenses as a percentage of e-commerce revenue continues to climb as Amazon paid units shipped far outpace revenue growth and gasoline price increases continue to override any Amazon efficiency gains. In the current money printing and political environment, energy costs are skyrocketing, thus having a direct and meaningful impact on Amazon profit potential for 2013 and beyond.\\nNote: Additional information on the model, data and analysis can be made available through my consulting practice.\\nDisclosure: I am short AMZN.'}]\n",

Your task is to create a comprehensive list of descriptors—words or phrases that distill the meaning, tone, style, genre, topics, and other characteristics of the document. Do not focus solely on the topics; also include phrases that describe the tone and style. Order the descriptors as they appear in the document.\\n\\n##Requirements:\\n\\n1. Generate Two Types of Descriptors:\\n    - General Descriptors: General Descriptors: Describe the document in aspects including, but not limited to, style, tone, genre, topic, domain, length, language, quality, etc. They should be general enough so they could likely be applied to other, hypothetical documents.\\n    - Specific Descriptors: Describe minute details specific to this document such as individual words and phrases, emphasis, structure, etc.\\n\\n2. Descriptor Details:\\n    - Descriptors can be single words or multi-word phrases. They should not be longer than five words.\\n    - Each descriptor should describe only one aspect of the document. Multi-aspect descriptors should be split into separate descriptors.\\n    - The list should be so extensive that, given only the list, a competent person should be able to rewrite the original document.\\n\\n3. Order:\\n    - Sequence: Order the descriptors in the sequence they appear in the document.\\n\\n##Possible general descriptors\\nHere is a list of general descriptors that you can choose from.
