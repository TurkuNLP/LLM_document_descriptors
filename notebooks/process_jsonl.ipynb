       " {'text': 'Mercury in western North America: A synthesis of environmental contamination, fluxes, bioaccumulation, and risk to fish and wildlife\\nWestern North America is a region defined by extreme gradients in geomorphology and climate, which support a diverse array of ecological communities and natural resources. The region also has extreme gradients in mercury (Hg) contamination due to a broad distribution of inorganic Hg sources. These diverse Hg sources and a varied landscape create a unique and complex mosaic of ecological risk from Hg impairment associated with differential methylmercury (MeHg) production and bioaccumulation. Understanding the landscape-scale variation in the magnitude and relative importance of processes associated with Hg transport, methylation, and MeHg bioaccumulation requires a multidisciplinary synthesis that transcends small-scale variability. The Western North America Mercury Synthesis compiled, analyzed, and interpreted spatial and temporal patterns and drivers of Hg and MeHg in air, soil, vegetation, sediments, fish, and wildlife across western North America. This collaboration evaluated the potential risk from Hg to fish, and wildlife health, human exposure, and examined resource management activities that influenced the risk of Hg contamination. This paper integrates the key information presented across the individual papers that comprise the synthesis. The compiled information indicates that Hg contamination is widespread, but heterogeneous, across western North America. The storage and transport of inorganic Hg across landscape gradients are largely regulated by climate and land-cover factors such as plant productivity and precipitation. Importantly, there was a striking lack of concordance between pools and sources of inorganic Hg, and MeHg in aquatic food webs. Additionally, water management had a widespread influence on MeHg bioaccumulation in aquatic ecosystems, whereas mining impacts where relatively localized. These results highlight the decoupling of inorganic Hg sources with MeHg production and bioaccumulation. Together the findings indicate that developing efforts to control MeHg production in the West may be particularly beneficial for reducing food web exposure instead of efforts to simply control inorganic Hg sources.\\nEagles-Smith, C.A., Wiener, J.G., Eckley, C.S., Willacker Jr., J.J., Evers, D.C., Marvin-DiPasquale, M.C., Obrist, D., Fleck, J.A., Aiken, G.R., Lepak, J.M., Jackson, A.K., Stewart, A.R., Webster, J., Davis, J.A., Alpers, C.N., Ackerman, J.T., 2016, Mercury in western North America- A synthesis of environmental contamination, fluxes, bioaccumulation and risk to fish and wildlife: Science of the Total Environment, p. 1213-1226, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.scitotenv.2016.05.094.\\nAdditional publication details\\n|Publication Subtype||Journal Article|\\n|Title||Mercury in western North America: A synthesis of environmental contamination, fluxes, bioaccumulation, and risk to fish and wildlife|\\n|Series title||Science of the Total Environment|\\n|Contributing office(s)||John Wesley Powell Center for Analysis and Synthesis, Forest and Rangeland Ecosystem Science Center, Toxic Substances Hydrology Program, California Water Science Center|\\n|Country||Canada, Mexico, United States|\\n|Online Only (Y/N)||N|\\n|Additional Online Files (Y/N)||N|',\n",

       " {'text': 'Last Monday’s announcement of Glass Enterprise Edition 2 (EE2) didn’t receive as many headlines as I had expected. That’s probably due to several different factors – the fact that it wasn’t announced at a major event, that it looks similar to the original Glass Enterprise Edition (EE1) device, etc. Don’t let the coverage fool you, though – Glass EE2 and the accompanying announcement that the Glass program has joined Google’s AR/VR team are major progress to advance assisted reality’s role in the industrial AR ecosystem. As one of the original Glass partners (actually, two if you count our Pristine acquisition in 2017), this is also a big milestone for Upskill’s 5-year partnership with the Glass team.\\nGlass EE2 Overview\\nAt first glance, it’ll be hard for a casual user to distinguish between the EE1 and EE2 devices. The most obvious way is spotting the USB-C charging connector, which displaces the proprietary connector of the EE1 device. With QuickCharge 3.0 support, most users should be able to charge during their lunch break and run for an entire day without being attached to an auxiliary battery. Notably, there will be a backward compatibility with EE1 frames, which is great news for businesses who have invested in the now-legacy product. Here’s a picture of that USB-C connector (excuse the early sample markings):\\nInside, the Qualcomm Snapdragon XR1 processor with the additional RAM makes Skylight more responsive, performant, and efficient. Early testing results have yielded in runtime for Skylight Live remote assistance increasing by a factor of 8 – an excellent test for the device under full load. Glass EE2 can comfortably stream audio and video 2-way for well over 2 hours. Even more importantly, EE2 didn’t suffer from any overheating-induced performance throttling or shutdowns found on EE1, which brings it to par with other assisted reality devices in bringing unrestricted use of streaming video and audio.\\nThe standout aspect of Glass devices has always been its small form factor making it easy to wear for all-day, every-day use. The fact that it’s able to get this level of performance and runtime on the industry’s lightest and smallest device, meaning with a lot less battery than others, is nothing short of impressive. This is why Glass has been the device of choice for many of our customers whose employees are expected to wear smart glasses most of their days.\\nThe excellent touchpad also returns. For applications in which totally hands-free interaction isn’t needed, the touchpad swipe gestures on Glass remains the benchmark for assisted reality.\\nWhere Glass EE2 Fits and Doesn’t\\nContinuing on the topic of wearability, Glass EE2 is best suited for work environments where smart glasses should be worn for most of the shift, such as in complex assembly, item picking, on-the-job training, QA, and many others. If hands-on workers are also in an environment where they are interacting with customers, such as in retail, hospitality, clinical healthcare, and customer service, Glass EE2’s non-intrusive form factor is also a good fit. Because it can stream in an unrestricted fashion, the utility of the device in those environments where remote assistance is needed has increased significantly.\\nWith that said, Glass still isn’t for everybody and every operating condition. Glass remains right-eye only, so those who are left-eye dominant are still locked out. Glass still isn’t as rugged as the industry benchmark Realwear HMT-1, so it probably shouldn’t be in your tool bag in a hard-hat environment. It’s an assisted reality device, so it shouldn’t be seen as an alternative to Microsoft HoloLens as they address fundamentally different use cases.\\nSkylight’s value proposition of allowing businesses to focus on the solutions and the benefits of AR and not on a particular device continues to grow with Glass EE2. Existing Skylight users can seamlessly switch to EE2 by installing the Skylight client on their fresh devices and simply log in. Upskill was the first Glass Partner which enabled AirWatch mobile device management support on smart glasses in our partnership with VMware, which announced day-one support for Glass EE2 on WorkspaceONE.\\nHow Can I Get It?\\nGlass EE2 is available today for Skylight customers who are full Skylight licensees (Core and Enterprise), Skylight pilots, or with select partners. As the recently launched Skylight Explorer program is a bring-your-own-device offering and EE2 isn’t generally available at this time, it may be challenging to get them as a part of your early journey today.\\nIf you are a business with well-defined applications on how Glass EE2 may be used in your operations with a budget to run a proof-of-value pilot, please contact us to learn more about how to get started.\\nUpskill will be featuring hands-on Skylight demos on EE2 at the Augmented World Expo in Santa Clara this week. Find us at booth 606.\\nGlass, now a part of Google AR/VR\\nAs a part of this announcement, Glass has also joined the Google AR/VR team, responsible for building products such as ARCore, Daydream, and Lens. The fact that Glass has joined the team leading the advancement of AR and VR at Google only helps to realize the full potential for assisted reality, a category that Glass enabled and Upskill named. I’m excited to see how Google’s technologies ranging from Android, machine learning, and cloud could unlock even more for assisted reality, further cementing its role in bringing the digital enterprise to the hands-on workforce.',\n",

       " {'text': 'Blanchefleur Le Roux Coffee Tables June 29, 2019 00:08:00\\nRustic art does not mean perfection. It is all about imperfect cuts and curves. Therefore before selecting a rustic table for your home you must check out the way it is designed. It must have harsh edges and a very rough look to it. The entire beauty of rustic art lies in its imperfection therefore this thing must be kept in mind before selecting a particular coffee table.\\nThe best thing about rustic furniture is that each piece is different from another which means that the piece you select will not be found out anywhere else except the place you have kept it. there are certain things that must be kept in mind while selecting a rustic table in order to make sure that you have invested in the right place.\\nThree of the most popular functions are storage, lift top, and eating meals.\\nHaving a coffee table allows you to enjoy snacks and a cup of coffee with your loves ones therefore it is recommended in every home. But you should make sure that you purchase the one that is not only of your choice but also matches the theme of your room. In case you have a contemporary theme you must choose a table that look stylish and highly fashionable but in case you have a rustic setting in your room then a contemporary coffee table will not fit in therefore for a rustic art theme you must select rustic.\\nContemporary and modern coffee tables are hardly recognizable as coffee tables in the traditional sense of the word, as they are usually rectangular and quite plain. The new designs however, are nothing but, and can even create a show-stopping conversational piece that is wonderful for the living room. Usually they are associated as a simple place to rest coffee next to a sofa or couch. More contemporary designs however are interesting enough to stand on their own, and can even be the centerpiece of the room.\\nThe first area of a home that guests will see is the living room. Therefore, it is important that the living room be decorated in a theme that portrays the host`s personality. No other furniture describes a homeowner`s individuality better than his or her choice of coffee tables. With manufacturers designing and making more coffee table sets every year, homeowners will never be out of designs to choose.',\n",

       " {'text': 'Amid the thunderous crash of America\\'s biggest-ever bank collapse, at least one Continental Illinois Bank official here has retained a calm sense of proportion and place.\\nAlbert K. Pounian, curator of the bank\\'s $3 million art collection, guides a visitor through the stricken institution\\'s Loop headquarters, recognizing hundreds of revered -- and valuable -- friends at a glance.\\n\"There\\'s a Mark Toby . . . here\\'s a Laddy John Dill . . . there\\'s a fine Henry Moore print!\" says Pounian, effortlessly ticking off the artists. \"I think they go especially well here.\" Works by these and dozens of other American and European artists hang in the bank\\'s corridors and public and private working areas, part of a trove of 6,000 artworks Continental owns.\\nWhatever the turmoil -- and there is plenty -- in Continental\\'s worldwide network of offices, Pounian\\'s domain is likely to remain intact. So long as there are customers and employes, it seems, the bank needs good art to help everybody feel better about what a bank is supposed to do best: lend money wisely and well.\\nLike hundreds of other American corporations, Continental began serious art collecting in the last decade. By the end of the 1970s, it had acquired several thousand pieces and needed professional help to keep track of what it had, get rid of the bad and find the best of what else might be available for purchase.\\nPounian, head of the art department at Barat College in nearby Lake Forest, Ill., and an artist in his own right, was hired. By the end of 1982, the collection had expanded to 6,000 pieces.\\n\"Almost nothing of museum quality,\" Pounian said. \"But a very eclectic collection of master prints from Europe and America, limited-edition graphics, photographs by the best artists, 19th-century folk art -- ship models, weather vanes, quilts. We try to relate those things to the function of a given area.\"\\nFor example, \"when we were big in Latin America,\" the bank bought contemporary South American art and used it to decorate important public spaces for its booming business there. But with Continental now in a program of massive retrenchment because of its financial failures, the Latin collection soon will have no place to hang south of the border. \"We\\'ll bring it back,\" Pounian said with certainty, and find other places for the works.\\nBob Champion, Continental\\'s senior vice president for corporate services who oversees Pounian, calls it \"basically a functional collection, not at all like those at the Chase or First Chicago.\" The Chase Manhattan Bank\\'s fine arts acquisitions program, reflecting the elevated tastes of David Rockefeller, is one of the pacesetters for the nation, and includes a number of extremely valuable works.\\n\"We tried to approach art buying in a prudent, businesslike manner,\" Champion said. \"We have an average unit price of about $500 per piece, and that works out to 60 cents a square foot for the entire organization, which itself spends $77 million housing our corporation worldwide. So the investment value is not real material.\" Champion and Pounian also organize seminars for employes to explain what it is they are looking at.\\nFor example, when the bank opened a new facility in Toronto, the office staff was treated to an hour lecture about and tour of the group of Canadian Indian primitives decorating the spaces. \"It helped them feelit\\'s theirs,\" Champion said. \"We work with the people in the area, ask them how we can help them. These arecollaborative efforts, and, in a sense, they are captive clients, so we probably have to work even harder at this.\"\\nIn all, America\\'s major businesses spent about $1.3 million buying artwork in 1982, says the New York-based Business Committee for the Arts, an industry support organization. That was a decline from 1981\\'s pace, when more than $3 million worth of paintings, sculpture, photographs, prints and handicrafts went into corporate vaults and onto business walls. The decrease reflected the economic hard times in the United States, and was duplicated at Continental, which ceased buying any art last year because of its financial problems. Only a complex $4.5 billion federal aid package arranged last month saved the bank from likely bankruptcy. It was the biggest government rescue of a bank in U.S. annals.\\n\"We\\'re obviously in a period of consolidation,\" Champion said. \"As space becomes vacant, we\\'ll inventory the art and reallocate it.\" Unexpectedly, the shrinkage is something of a boon to Pounian. He had had dozens of requests from executives for art that he could not fill because of the bank\\'s rapid expansion in the 1970s. Now, he can look forward to brightening the offices of anyone who survives the cuts that are coming.',\n",

       " {'text': 'Sample Sizes Are Starting to Matter – Sit Rizzo and Benintendi?\\nIt is amazing how time flies. I remember like it was yesterday, fawning over ADP’s and overdrafts. Vlad Jr, I am staring directly at you with a grimace and a baffled brow my soon-to-be promoted friend. Now, it’s sell high, buy low and trade opportunities front and center. Seventy-five at-bats and some owners are already rushing to dump their “busts” while others are waiting in the weeds to pounce on an opportunity to take advantage of co-owners with weak stomachs. Chris Sale. I am staring directly at you my friend. How is this relevant to the weekly hitting planner? I always reference sample sizes and how we need them to make sound, supported decisions. Well, Start/Sit decisions are starting to be impacted by 2019 stats. Sample Sizes are starting to matter in Start/Sit decisions. They are becoming relevant rather than deceptive or insignificant nuisances to be seen, but not heard.\\nSample sizes are growing and with more data comes more legitimacy. Trends that owners can use to inform rather than deceive are developing. How a player is slugging in the last seven to 14 days is beginning to matter. A player’s career, his left/right splits, pitching matchups or how many games they have on the schedule always matter, but recency is less biased and more relevant now than before. That’s a meaningful change. It shouldn’t be a significant factor when deciding whether to buy or sell struggling stars yet, but it should inform your Start/Sit decision-making process.\\nFive Game Schedules For Your Week 5 Start/Sit Decisions\\nAs I said in previous weeks, when a possible “starter” has five games and his alternatives have seven, he immediately becomes a possible “sitter,” regardless of any other possible factors. It is one of the most impactful situations owners need to consider. I have already sat Xander Bogaerts, Andrew Benintendi, Joey Gallo, and Starling Marte for lesser alternatives because of the scheduling disparity in 2019. Fortunately for Fantasy owners, it’s a lesser factor in Week 5.\\nThere are only three teams with a five-game slate and two of them are the San Francisco Giants and Toronto Blue Jays. Neither team has a must-start player or any serious alternatives to consider before the scheduling disadvantage this week. If you are starting Freddy Galvis or Justin Smoak in deeper leagues, their schedule puts them on the Sit list, but outside of them, the pickings are slim way out West in San Fran and up and up and away in the nasty North where the Jays roam and play. There are a few tougher calls with the third five-game team, the San Diego Padres.\\nThe Padres have two games at home, a friendly pitchers park, and three in Washington where they will face Max Scherzer and Stephen Strasburg. They also face Jeremy Hellickson, but that’s hardly an enticer with the scheduling bind Padre owners have been put in this week.\\nFernando Tatis Jr., SS San Diego Padres\\nSix HRs – 13 RBI – 11 Runs Scored – Four SBs – .296 Batting Average\\nTatis Jr. is tied for third in points scored for shortstops, two points behind leaders Paul Dejong and Javier Baez. He is tied for the position lead with six home runs and tied for third in stolen bases. Five games or not. Scherzer and Strasburg or not. Tatis is a Must-Start and one of the best steals of Draft-Day season. He has played like a Top 50 pick (Vlad Jr., looking at you again) even though he wasn’t selected anywhere near it.\\nEric Hosmer, 1B San Diego Padres\\nOne HR – Seven Runs – Nine RBIs – .184 BA\\nHosmer is more of a name than a serious Fantasy asset and he has been worse than the underwhelming first base contributions that we have come to expect. I mentioned him because his name still draws some respect while his numbers need to be known so that name recognition doesn’t make him a Start when he is actually a Must-Sit.\\nWil Myers, 3B/OF San Diego Padres\\nFive HRs – Two SBs – Nine Runs – Nine RBIs – .294 BA\\nMyers is a tough call. Five total games with two against Scherzer and Strasburg, struggles from Strasburg notwithstanding, is a difficult position for owners to be in.\\nHe is bringing it on the bases and in the box, both in batting average and in home runs. On top of that, he competes for the start against third base and outfield alternatives, allowing owners to Sit their strugglers or mask their roster weaknesses by moving him around and considering more potential alternatives on the roster or the wire.\\nIn shallower leagues, there is an argument for sitting Myers, but it’s a weak one. He is as close to a Must-Start as a player gets without officially being so. I have Mookie Betts and Xander Bogaerts with seven games and Victor Robles with three of six starts in Coors field. Even with those extremely strong alternatives, I am likely starting Myers. Sorry, Victor. Start.\\nSmall Samples: Starts/Sit Stars On the Hot Seat\\nWith sample sizes growing in totals and legitimacy, it’s time to at least consider benching struggling stars. It’s still too early to cut bait and sell them on the cheap when low-ball trade offers pour in, but that doesn’t mean you have to sacrifice your head-to-head matchups out of some misplaced sense of loyalty. Sample Sizes are starting to matter in Start/Sit decisions and that includes stars as well as scrubs and borderline calls.\\nHere are a few Star-Crossed Start/Sit Samples that matter for Owners Decisions\\nJose Ramirez, 2B/3B Cleveland Indians\\n7-Day Trends: 3/21 – 1 HR – 3 Runs – 1 RBI – 2 SBs – .143\\n14-Day Trends: 7/47 – 1 HR – 5 Runs – 2 RBI – 4 SB – .149\\nPablo Lopez/Sandy Alcantara/Gerrit Cole/Collin McHugh/Wade Miley/Brad Peacock\\nHe has zero home runs, one RBI, 10 strikeouts, a .120 batting average and .350 OPS against right-handed pitching in 2019. He will face five of them in Week 5. He killed them in 2018, so it looks like Ramirez is struggling rather than trending, but that kind of performance is an issue, small sample or not.\\nThe pitching matchups aren’t overly troubling and Ramirez benefits from four games in hitter-friendly Houston while he is at a disadvantage with two starts in a pitcher-friendly ballpark in Miami.\\nThe samples are growing, but are still too small to bench the Fantasy star. Come back next week if this one is another stinker. I wanted to say Sit this week, but I couldn’t quite get there. Next week I may not be so forgiving.\\nAndrew Benintendi, OF Boston Red Sox\\n7-Day Trends: 2/7 – 0 HR – 1 Run – 0 RBI – ..286 BA\\nSpencer Turnbull/Tyson Ross/Jordan ZImmerman/Daniel Norris/Charlie Morton/Tyler Glasnow/TBA\\nFenway Park is not a good place for left-handers to hit for power, especially early in the season, and we are seeing that with Benintendi in 2019. He’s batting .279 with six extra-base hits with an OBP of .357. He isn’t struggling. He hasn’t been bad. He just hasn’t been anything special. He has been “Fantasy pedestrian.” Six runs scored, six RBIs, one home run and one stolen base. Those aren’t Must-Start numbers, especially considering how high he was drafted in yearly leagues.\\nHe has seven games on the schedule, but he will face the Tampa Bay Rays, who have been one of the best pitching staffs in baseball. He won’t face any aces and he should avoid Blake Snell who is on IL.\\nIn deep leagues, he is a fourth or fifth OF that can be benched depending on the skill sets of owners’ alternatives. In shallow leagues, he is a Sit until he starts hitting for power or stealing bases in bunches. Sample Sizes are starting to matter in Start/Sit decisions and while Benintendi’s aren’t disturbing, they aren’t glowing either. I lean Sit for Benny Biceps.\\nAnthony Rizzo, 1B Chicago Cubs\\n7-Day Trends: 1/16 – 0 HR – 3 Runs – 1 RBI – .063 BA\\n14-Day Trends: 4/40 – 1 HR – 7 Runs – 6 RBIs – .100 BA\\nKenta Maeda/Walker Buehler/Julio Urias/Robbie Ray/Zack Godley/Luke Weaver\\nI looked at seven-day trends to see who is struggling and who is roasting when preparing this column. For the stars that were struggling, I looked at the 14-day sample to see if it was a NoteWorthy, rough week or something more like a Trend. For Rizzo, it’s an ugly early-season trend. Batting .100 in 40 at-bats doesn’t change my opinion of a player’s career of course, but it means enough to consider sitting them in 2019.\\nRizzo batted .283 with 21 of his 25 home runs against right-handed pitching in 2018 and he faces four of them in Week 5. That’s good. His recent numbers. A lot of bad. I was offered Rizzo for Chris Sale in a trade this week. Makes me laugh now. Rizzo is a Sit this week. 40 bad at-bats is enough to go another way until he turns it around.\\nCarlos Correa, SS Houston Astros\\n7-Day Trends: 2/19 – 0 HR – 1 Run – 1 RBI – 0 SB – .105 BA\\n14-Day Trends: 10/42 – 1 HR – 5 Runs – 6 RBIs – 1 SB – .238\\nThe bright side for Correa. Seven games, all at home, in a bandbox for right-handers with a short porch down the left field line, batting in a loaded lineup that enhances his RBI and Runs scored potential. Add Correa’s reputation and it seems implausible to believe he is a Start/Sit consideration. But he is. His current performance has been poor and he is scheduled to face Carlos Carrasco, Trevor Bauer, Shane Bieber and Corey Kluber. I am sitting Correa. Not just sitting, Must-Sit.\\nThe Also-Rans and Borderline Start/Sit Decisions\\nSitting a star after only four weeks is tough to do. Starting a “scrub” after only four weeks can be just as difficult. A star has a track record sitting there for all to see on the back of a baseball card. A scrub either doesn’t have a track record or it’s a bad one. It’s why he is labeled a “scrub” in Auction league lingo. It’s why he is on the waiver wire in the majority of leagues as well. Sample Sizes are starting to matter in Start/Sit decisions and that can apply to lesser known players with little or no track record to either bolster or refute their current stats. The lack of a track record doesn’t mean a player isn’t good and it doesn’t mean owners should dismiss the small sample. It just makes them undervalued or under appreciated and this week, it could make him your starter.\\nHere are a few Also-Rans, or in auction leagues, players known as “scrubs,” that deserve Start consideration.\\nAustin Meadows, OF Tampa Bay Rays\\n7-Day Trends: 0 HR – 3 Runs – 2 RBIs – 1 SB – .333 BA\\n14-Day Trends: 4 HRs – 9 Runs – 12 RBIs – 2 SB – .429\\nBrad Keller/Homer Bailey/Jacob Junis/David Price/Chris Sale/TBA\\nMeadows was a small-sample size darling for awhile and deservedly so. What everyone forgot was that while he was a touted prospect for a minute in Pittsburgh, he was eventually a disappointing one. He never profiled as a 30-home run, 30 stolen base super star even though he has looked like one early on in 2019. From a Fantasy perspective, he always profiled as a good to very good prospect. But, he always lacked ceiling.\\nHis 14-Day trend suggests he is a must-start. The matchups and his 7-Day trend suggests he’s a Sit. Sample Sizes are starting to matter in Start/Sit decisions, but that doesn’t always mean for the better. It can still be deceptive. The 2019 Meadows we have seen appear to be unsustainable and while even his small sample has been erratic and inconsistent, they look too good to Sit. They look too good because the sample is still too small. Sometimes an indicator is just a flashing light that will eventually lead nowhere.\\nThree games at Fenway Park with the wind potentially blowing in and a possible rain out or two, a huge right field and two power left handers (Chris Sale and David Price) on the bump. I realize the Red Sox have pitched horribly, but does anyone believe Sale and Price are THIS bad? Are owners loading up lefties against them in Daily Fantasy?\\nMeadows has been pedestrian in his last seven after a monstrous week and a very good overall start. He needs to be owned, but in most formats, benched, in Week #5. I struggle to feel sorry for owners that bought Meadows hot Start. History matters and the reports on him were never glistening. I could be wrong. Meadows may be a Fantasy All Star this season. But, while the samples are still small, I am still a skeptic and that means he is a Sit this week.\\nChristian Walker, 1B Arizona Diamondbacks\\n7-Day Trends: 11/25 – 3 HR – 4 Runs – 5 RBIs – 2 SB – .440 BA\\n14-Day Trends: 13/41 – 3 HR – 5 Runs – 5 RBIs – 2 SB – .317 BA\\nFive of Walker’s six home runs have been against right-handed pitching and he will face six of seven this week. The pitching matchups don’t make you run and hide, but it is tougher than the average Start/Sit consideration. Darvish strikes out a lot of batters, even with his command issues. Jordan Lyles, Joe Musgrove and Trevor Williams have ERA’s of .53, .81 and 2.59 respectively while Jameson Taillon has a very respectable 3.43 ERA. Not a lot of high-profile names but the Pirates rotation has quietly been exceptional and that’s who Walker will face this week.\\nWalker and his seven-game week deserve consideration. A .440 batting average is a hot-streak owners can capitalize on and his hot hitting against right-handers enhances the case for a Start. But, it is still a small sample and the matchups are more difficult than they appear on their face. I lean Sit, but it’s a reluctant one. He is worthy in deeper leagues and needs to be owned in more than 35% on Yahoo.\\nOmar Narvaez, CA Seattle Mariners\\n7-Day Trends: 7/18 – 3 HRs – 6 Runs – 6 RBIs – .389 BA\\n14-Day Trends: 13/40 – 3 HR – 11 Runs – 7 RBI – .325 BA\\nNick Margevicius/Chris Paddack/Adrian Sampson/Shelby Miller/Mike Minor/Lance Lynn\\nNarvaez is on a seven day hot streak with a friendly six game schedule in Week #5. He has hit .313 with a .887 OPS and four home runs against right handed pitching this season. He has also hit three of his five home runs at home, of which he also has four games this week.\\nNarvaez is tied for eighth overall in runs scored and leads catchers. He is tied for second amongst catchers in home runs, ranks fourth in RBIs and has a .304 batting average on the season. All that, and he is still only owned in 61% of Yahoo leagues. He is a must-own and with a friendly group of pitching matchups and a six game week, he is a Must-Start this week.\\nNoteworthy Left/Right Splits of the Week\\nStrangely enough there hasn’t been an overly dominant hitter against left handed pitching. Sample Sizes are starting to matter in Start/Sit decisions, but when it comes to trends against left handed pitching, the sample isn’t showing us enough to be worth considering. Khris Davis leads the league in home runs against lefties with only five while Jose Altuve and J.D. Martinez have hit four apiece. All three are must-starts regardless of splits or trends. The fact that they lead the league with less than overwhelming totals doesn’t do us much good in identifying helpful samples. To find a borderline starter that this weeks splits against left handed pitching could swing the scales I had to look to Ketel Marte who only has three home runs, a .310 batting average and .966 OPS. Hardly worth a write up. Against right handers, the pickings were a bit more poultry.\\nJesse Winker, OF Cincinnati Reds\\nNoteWorthy Splits vs. Right-Handed Pitching\\n6 HRs – 9 RBI – .182 BA\\nWinker is a right-handed hitter who happens to be slugging well in a reverse split. On the downside, he has struck out 12 times and is batting .182 against right-handed pitching in 2019, but he has six home runs and nine RBIs against them. Mikolas has an ERA of almost 5.00 (4.95) while Flaherty DOES have an ERA of exactly 5.00. It could be argued that they are the toughest matchups Winker might face this week unless you buy into Kevin Gausman’s early season 2.75 ERA and .76 WHIP.\\nThe Reds have a crowded outfield that could limit his at-bats but with his power splits and all of his team’s games against right-handers, he should see enough at-bats to be a strong start with beneficial power splits. He has 23 at-bats in his last seven days and is only owned in 45% of leagues.\\nFor teams that can’t find a spot for Winker, he is at the very least an affordable DFS play. He is scheduled to face Julio Teheran, who has allowed five home runs in five starts. He will also face Dakota Hudson, who has allowed five home runs with a 6.08 ERA and 2.33 WHIP in only four starts and Jack Flaherty who has allowed four home runs in four starts and 18 innings pitched in 2019.\\nI don’t buy into Winker as a player, but if the alternatives are equally as “questionable,” the power he has shown against right-handed pitching puts him slightly ahead of some mediocre to bad alternatives. If Winker is on your radar then his splits are probably enough to put him on the Start side rather than the Sit side of a difficult decision.\\nJoc Pederson, OF Los Angeles Dodgers\\nNoteworthy Splits vs. Right Handed Pitching\\n8 HRs – 14 RBIs – .267 BA – 1.125 OPS\\nI wrote up, claimed and started Pederson last week because of his strong splits against right-handed pitching. And his season stats are why he deserves a repeat mention this week. He will face four right-handers in a six-start week. However, he is more of a sit than a start due to a slightly less appealing mix of matchups. Sample Sizes are starting to matter in Start/Sit decisions and in the case of Pederson, we saw a small 2019 sample proven true. He has had a strong performance in week #4 after the matchups and his splits against right-handed pitching suggested he would.\\nHe does face four right-handed pitchers this week, but three of the four are Pirates starters who have ERA’s of 2.00 (Archer), .81 (Musgrove) and 2.59 (Williams). If the ERA wasn’t enough of a deterrent, they have allowed a combined total of four home runs. The Dodgers lean heavily on the left/right splits when it comes to filling out the lineup card and with two lefties on the bump, Pederson could sit against Quintana and Hamels. Even if Pederson gets five starts, that puts his at-bat totals in the borderline area compared to most alternatives and that’s before we factor in the pitching matchups, which are on the tougher side this week. The season splits suggest Pederson is a must-start, but if you look closer, he is a Sit this week.\\nYou can follow me on Twitter @CJMitch73 or on Facebook in the Fantasy Sports group “A Podcast To Be Named Later” and we will have a Podcast coming in the not-too-distant future, so keep an eye-out.\\nFantrax was one of the fastest growing fantasy sites of 2018 and things are only getting better in 2019!

       " {'text': 'Leeuwarden-Fryslan, one of the less populated parts of the Netherlands, has been designated this year’s European Capital of Culture. It’s a hub of social and technological and cultural innovation and yet hardly anyone has heard of the place. It makes batteries that the makers claim run circles around Tesla’s current technology, there are advanced plans for the region to go fossil free by 2025, it has one of the highest (and happiest) immigrant populations in Europe, and yet all we can see from the minibus, from horizon to horizon, is cows.\\nWhen you’re invited to write about an area you know nothing about, a good place to start is the heritage. But even that can’t help us here. The tiny city of Leeuwarden boasts three hugely famous children: spy and exotic dancer Mata Hari, astrophysicist Jan Hendrik Oort (he of the Oort Cloud) and puzzle-minded artist Maurits Cornelis Escher. The trouble is, all three are famous for being maddening eccentrics.\\nAll Leeuwarden’s poor publicists can do then, having brought us here, is throw everything at us and hope something sticks. And so it happens that, somewhere between the (world-leading) Princessehof ceramics museum and Lan Fan Taal, a permanent pavilion celebrating world languages, someone somewhere makes a small logistical error and locks me inside an M C Escher exhibition.\\nEscher, who died in 1972, is famous for using mathematical ideas in his art, drawing on concepts from symmetry and hyperbolic geometry to create complex tessellated images. And the Fries Museum in Leeuwarden has gathered more than 80 original prints for me to explore, along with drawings, photographs and memorabilia, so there is no possibility of my getting bored.\\nNor is the current exhibition, Escher’s Journey, the usual, chilly celebration of the man’s puzzle-making ability and mathematical sixth sense. Escher was a pleasant, passionate man with a taste for travel, and this show reveals how his personal experiences shaped his art.\\nEscher’s childhood was by his own account a happy one. His parents took a good deal of interest in his education without ever restricting his intellectual freedom. This was as well, since he was useless at school. Towards the end of his studies, he and his parents traveled through France to Italy, and in Florence he wrote to a friend: “I wallow in it, but so greedily that I fear that my stomach will not be able to withstand it.”\\nThe cultural feast afforded by the city was the least of it. The Leeuwarden native was equally staggered by the surrounding hills – the sheer, three-dimensional fact of them; the rocky coasts and craggy defiles; the huddled mountain villages with squares, towers and houses with sloping roofs. Escher’s love of the Italian landscape consumed him and, much to his mother’s dismay, he was soon permanently settled in the country.\\nFor visitors familiar to the point of satiety and beyond with Escher’s endlessly reproduced and commodified architectural puzzles and animal tessellations, the sketches he made in Italy during the 1920s and 1930s are the highlight of this show. Escher’s favored medium was the engraving. It’s a time-consuming art, and one that affords the artist time to think and to tinker. Inevitably, Escher began merging his sketches into new, realistic wholes. Soon he was trying out unusual perspectives and image compilations. In Still Life with Mirror (1934), he crossed the threshold, creating a reflected world that proves on close inspection to be physically and mathematically impossible.\\nThe usual charge against Escher as an artist – that he was too caught up in the toils of his own visual imagination to express much humanity – is hard to rebuff. There’s a gap here it’s not so easy to bridge: between Escher the approachable and warm-hearted family man and Escher the grumpy Parnassian (he once sent Mick Jagger away with a flea in his ear for asking him for an album cover).\\nThe second world war had a lot to answer for, of course, not least because it drove Escher out of his beloved Italian hills and back, via Switzerland, to the flat old, dull old Netherlands. “Italy, the landscape, the people, they speak to me.” he explained in 1968. “Switzerland doesn’t and Holland even less so.”\\nWithout the landscape to inform his art, other influences came to dominate. Among the places he had visited as war gathered was the Alhambra in Granada. The complex geometric patterns covering its every surface, and their timeless, endless repetition, fascinated him. For days on end he copied the Arab motifs in the palace. Back in the Netherlands, their influence, and Escher’s growing fascination with the mathematics of tessellation, would draw him away from landscapes toward an art consisting entirely of “visualised thoughts”.\\nBy the time his images were based on periodic tilings (meaning that you can slide a pattern in a certain direction and have it exactly overlay the original), his commentaries suggest that Escher had come to embrace his own, somewhat sterile reputation. “I played a game,” he recalled, “indulged in imaginary thoughts, with no other intention than to explore the possibilities of representation. In my work I give a report on these discoveries.”\\nIn the end Escher’s designs became so fiendishly complex, his output dropped almost to zero, and much of his time was taken up lecturing and corresponding about his unique way of working. He corresponded with mathematicians, though he never considered himself one. He knew Roger Penrose. He lived to see the first fractal shapes evolve out of the mathematical studies of Koch and Mandelbrot, though it wasn’t until after his death that Benoît Mandelbrot coined the word “fractal” and popularised the concept.\\nEventually, I am missed. At any rate, someone thinks to open the gallery door. I don’t know how long I was in there, locked in close proximity to my childhood hero. (Yes, as a child I did those jigsaw puzzles; yes, as a student I had those posters on my wall) I can’t have been left inside Escher’s Journey for more than a few minutes. But I exited a wreck.\\nThe Fries Museum has lit Escher’s works using some very subtle and precise spot projection; this and the trompe-l’œil monochrome paintwork on the walls of the gallery form a modestly Escherine puzzle all by themselves. Purely from the perspective of exhibition design, this charming, illuminating, and comprehensive show is well worth a visit.\\nYou wouldn’t want to live there, though.',\n",

       " {'text': 'Treasure is something we value because we give it value. If we didn’t value it, it wouldn’t be something to covet or desire. So when the mysterious Nanana Ryuugajou has an entire collection of treasures for her island friends to find, of course they’re going to take them by any means necessary! But when it comes to treasure, there is only one for the many who want it. And thus, a community of thieves is born! And when it comes to thieves, who can you really trust?\\nNanana’s Buried Treasure (Ryuugajou Nanana no Maizoukin) is set on a man-made island where Nanana thrives. There, Juugo Yama is sent by his parents to go to high school, while doing what his family does already: look for buried treasure, and that includes stealing it if he has to. But when he checks in to his apartment, he finds a strange girl already residing there: the ghost of Nanana Ryuugajou herself!\\nNanana used to love searching for treasure. The trinkets she found contained special powers that the owner could wield at his or her disposal; so having such treasures clearly made someone powerful. But when she was still a teenager, Nanana was murdered and her treasures had been scattered across the island. Her ghost has since been confined to Juugo’s apartment, never to look for treasure again!\\nJuugo is given the task to find these treasures by his ghostly apartment mate who spends most of her time playing video games and eating all of his pudding. But he’s definitely not the only one searching for Nanana’s Collection! And so, we have our ensemble of treasure hunters, thieves, and detectives, all coveting the same things!\\nI’m not going to go through the entire cast of characters, but needless to say, you probably can’t trust any of them. Where there’s treasure to be found, there are also greedy people. And when it comes to looking for treasure by any means necessary, there are plenty of chances to make alliances, double-cross friends, and deceive enemies. Allies, friends, and enemies are all pretty much the same thing, and Juugo knows that. He’s from an entire family of thieves, after all!\\nBut still, they seem to work things out in this way of life. I guess?\\nYukihime Fuji and Shu Todomatsu are in a treasure hunting partnership called the Phantom Thief Troupe Matsuri. They may be rivals to Juugo and his friends, but Juugo respects them as a big brother and sister (and by respect, I mean getting under their skin most of the time).\\nIt may be tough to follow who exactly is being just over who is being a deceiver, seeing that every character takes on multiple roles and personalities, given any situation. But at least one thing is certain, and that is that each character wants Nanana’s Collection. Some are looking for power, others for revenge. Some are looking for fame, others are simply curious about what her treasures can do. Taking them seems to be no easy task either, as simply finding the treasure chests are difficult to find, and there are plenty of traps to get to them in the first place!\\nNanana’s Collection contains a marvel of treasures that hold special abilities and different values, and it is said that any one person who can take them all will be very powerful. But if you were to ask me what I think is the most valuable treasure, I would have to say Nanana’s smile.\\nNanana may be a ghost, but in the end, she’s still a girl. And when it comes to finding her treasure, no one other than Juugo seems to be looking for it for the girl who started the treasure hunt in the first place.\\nNanana remains as a ghost because she has been looking for the one who murdered her. While each part of her collection has special abilities in their own right, there is no doubt that each treasure is also a part of herself, and gathering all of them may be the one chance Juugo can get to find her murderer. What better reason is there to find Nanana’s Collection than to find them for Nanana herself?\\nBut Nanana isn’t so narrow-minded as to just trust Juugo with this task. She may be a tragic figure to this comedic anime, but she isn’t any more perfect than anyone else! And for her, there is another reason she remains as a ghost on this island.\\nShe wants to see everyone on this island grow together.\\nThey may be cheating, deceiving, and otherwise cutthroat thieves in the end. But for Nanana, that’s all part of the thrill of being a treasure hunter. She was a treasure hunter herself, before she died. And that’s how she wants to see it for everyone who has lived on her island. And even though she will never forgive her murderer if and when she finds him, she can appreciate what all of the characters in this series have done to look for her collection, and the joy that they got from finding each one. Who can ask for a better heroine than that?\\nIf you were to ask me who my favorite anime girls are, the vast majority of them are girls who can clearly show they can do things for themselves, and not transfer their situation over to some guy. But for Nanana, I have to make an exception, because her happiness is something that I would want to treasure.\\nBut seeing that I’m a human being on this plane of existence and therefore not an anime character, she’s just too adorable and funny for words alone! So keep looking for those treasures, find justice your own way, and don’t forget to bring home some pudding!\\nSo if you like the thrill of looking for treasure and can appreciate the multiple personalities of some really whacky characters, watch Nanana’s Buried Treasure. And now, I have to go buy some more pudding, because they went missing, for some reason.',\n",

       " {'text': 'By the time a farmer knows their crops are dying, it’s often too late. Caterpillars or viruses have preyed on their tomato and spinach plants. And the crops are gone.\\nA new robotic system, called Prospera, aims to save these plants. Using a network of cameras and sensors, it immediately detects invaders and knows when crops are sick. It then alerts and tells farmers exactly why through an app.\\n“The entire agriculture industry itself is due for an evolution,” Prospera CEO Daniel Koppel tells Tech Insider. “Farmers who are accustomed to making decisions based on instinct will be able to look to data, and deliver the freshest produce to the grocery store every harvest.”\\nThe sensors collect hundreds of thousands of data points about plants’ health. These include issues with pests, diseases, nutrients, irrigation, and climate.\\nFor example, in the photo below, the camera notices that phytophthora (a plant-killing mould) is on the leaves.\\nCaterpillars and mildew have messed with the chilli peppers pictured below.\\nProspera’s system also monitors and archives facts that affect plants’ nutrition, like temperature, pH, CO2, and oxygen.\\nBelow, the top photo of tomato plants is what the naked eye sees, and the bottom photo is what Prospera’s bots see.\\nThe cameras monitor the plants 24-7, and when something’s wrong, they send photos and sensor data to the cloud. The system then analyses the data, creates a summary on the app, and pings the farmer. The app also provides real-time data about the plants, even if they’re all healthy.\\nTo install the system, Prospera just hooks the cameras to poles, and then sticks them in the ground along the farm. Solar panels and Wifi (or 3G data) power the system, which farmers purchase as an annual subscription. Koppel declined to reveal specific pricing.\\nUsing machine learning, Prospera’s system can predict when a plant might be at risk depending on the time of year or upcoming weather patterns.\\nThis also means that the longer the bot’s system works on the farm and the more data it collects, the smarter it becomes.\\n“This offers the possibility of recognising new strains of diseases before they become widespread,” Koppel says.\\nFounded in 2014, Prospera now works with some of the largest vegetable growers in the world, including ones that supply to Walmart and the British grocery giant Tesco. It’s also expanding to be orchards and vineyards ranging from 50 to 4,000 acres.\\nThe tools to monitor farms haven’t changed much in the past few decades, but Prospera’s bots could change that.\\n“Farmers are still missing out on the critical component of seeing and knowing exactly what is happening to their crops at all times,” Koppel says.',\n",

       " {'text': 'This week we will be re-visiting the “Through the Mud and the Blood” World War 1 rule set that Curt introduced us to last year. The scenario is fictional, but based on several accounts of Canadian breakthroughs of the German lines in April - June of 1915 from the excellent books “Gallant Canadians” and “The Brave Battalion\". Several times the Canadian troops rushed the line and took objectives that no one reasonably expected them to take, while taking casualties that would have sent other troops into retreat. Then, being still new to the war and their leaders unsure of how much freedom of control they had, just stopped. Not willing to take the initiative, they instead followed their orders to the letter.\\nThis week we will explore what could have transpired, if one fateful night several sections of Canadians from the 10th and 16th Battalions had decide to advance into enemy territory.\\nCanadian Briefing: It’s early in the war, shortly after the 2nd Battle of Ypres; the lines are still confused and not quite settled back to their old grinding stalemate positions around the town after the German’s vile gas attack a few weeks ago. In an effort to gain back ground the 10th and 16th were sent forward to objective K5, a trench line on high ground leading to low lying farmland behind. The German defences had not been prepared properly for your assault and they retreated from the line. In fact, less than a mile beyond the line the farmland looked untouched by the war, all the fighting having taken place from the ridge westward.\\nSergeant A.L. Lindsay has taken the initiative and ordered several sections forward behind enemy lines in the dark hours of the night, before the Germans can prepare any defence in depth or worse yet a counter attack. The plan is to follow the routed Germans in the hopes of finding a higher level commander and disrupt the chain of command so that no immediate counter attack can be launched against K5.\\nJust before dawn, and far behind enemy lines in the confusion, your scouts report a lightly defended farm house up ahead where they have spotted several German officers in deep discussion poring over maps. The farm house is located along a crossroad that has hedged fields surrounding it, a perfect place to sneak in close before attacking.\\nCan the Canadians prove successful behind the lines. or will they end up as more names to be etched on monuments, lost in the mud of Flanders fields?\"\\n|The Germans have held strategic meetings in these|\\nruins trying to regroup and launch a counter-attack\\nThe Canadian commanders would be Kevin, Jim, Brian, and Bill, with Dave lending moral support. They had 2 sections of 10th Battalion riflemen and 2 sections of 16th Battalion riflemen. Two of the sections were over-sized and had additional assault elements in them. The mission for the Canadians was to break through to a farm where German officers were spotted gathing and planning. Once there they need to either capture any enemy documents preferably attack maps or plans, or if none are there capturing a German officer will do, as long as you can bring him back alive.The Canadians are attacking at dawn and have excellent cover to advance through. However, they realize they are deep into enemy territory and will need to retreat as soon as the enemy realizes they are there and sends reinforcements, how long that will take, they don\\'t know.\\n|Pre-game look from the Canadian Side|\\nThe German commanders were Greg and Dallas. They only had 2 small rifle sections, but did have an HMG as well. The mission for the Germans is to simply hold out and keep the Canadians at bay long enough that re-enforcements arrive to send them scampering off. While vastly outnumbered, and the enemy having ideal cover to advance against them, the Germans have some small artillery nearby that has already zeroed in on a few strategic choke points. Unfortunately ammunition is limited and there will only be a few rounds of SOS fire support available. The Germans need to hold out for 10 turns before reinforcements arrive.\\n|Pre-game look from the German side|\\nThe German commanders setup a blind in each building and one just behind and centralized for support options.\\nThe first few turns went well for the Canadians, rushing forward while still under their blinds to get as close as possible to the German held farm house. On the second turn, the German commanders reveal a rifle section located behind the other two blinds for support, and send a runner to the rear to attempt to initiate an SOS artillery strike.\\nOn the third turn one Canadian blind gets too close and the Germans decide to reveal themselves and attempt to spot the enemy. The Canadians have been spotted, by an HMG section! Luckily the officer had to use his initiative to spot and the section would only be firing at the end of the turn.\\nThe artillery only had minor effect though, inflicting a few casualties on the Canadians and one on the Germans, as well as a few points of shock all around.\\nOn turn four the Canadians, trying to advance out of the artillery fire and into the German lines assaulted on the far right. However two sections were struck by the continuing artillery fire and left with more shock and a few casualties. The Canadian players were getting extremely worried with shock piling up and still one more turn of incoming fire from the artillery.\\nTherefore only a single section could mount an attack. While the attack was swift, if met stiff resistance from the Germans dug in behind the brick walls of the farmyard. The first round of combat saw only shock placed on either side, but then since it was a draw and a second round was immediately fought, 3 Canadians fell to only 1 German. The surviving Canadians withdrew back through the hedges with enough shock to bottle.\\nTurn 6 saw shots trading back and forth as both sides tried to remove enough shock to accomplish some movement in the coming turns.\\nTurn 7 saw the Canadians launch yet another assault through the hedges at the HMG squad, this time with the remains of an over-sized sections through. The HMG section did well, killing a Canadian and inflicting 2 points of shock, but the Canadians having them vastly outnumbered killed 3 and inflicted numerous points of shock. The few surviving Germans had no choice but to fall back as they lost combat and bottled.\\nThe German forces across the road combined forces on turn 9 and launched a long distance assault on the Canadian forces in the farm house. This time the tides were turned, with the Germans out numbering the remaining Canadians almost 2 to 1.\\nThe Canadians however had the advantage of solid cover in the building and drove the Germans back after 2 bloody rounds of combat. Leaving 2 more Canadians dead, but also saw 3 Germans fall from the 2 assaulting units. This forced the Germans to fall back from combat but not to bottle.\\nHowever, as in real history the Canadians held their nerve through everything and kept on going.\\nThe Canadian assault on the HMG was a major turning point as it gave them free access to at least one building for searching, which turned out to be the correct one. The Germans then felt good with an assault going against the Canadians with almost 2-1 odds, however Brian (don\\'t tell me the odds) was rolling for the Canadians, and saved the day.\\nIn the end the game came right down to the wire, as German re-enforcements could have started arriving the following turn.\\nHopefully everyone had a fun game, and I will break these figures and terrain out more often now that they are done.',\n",

The subject of the letter is of particular interest to me as I am the first ever Polish born British Member of Parliament and Chairman of the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Poland.\\nI am pleased that you raised the issue of Polish suffering in World War II, as this is a topic that is often overlooked. By 1945 an estimated 3 million Polish Jews and 1.9 million non-Jewish Polish citizens had been murdered. In addition, in Warsaw 72 per cent of buildings, and 90 per cent of the cultural history, was destroyed. In 1939, 38 per cent of all Poland’s wealth was stolen and some estimates have put the total cost of damage done to be as high as $1 trillion.\\nThe issue of war reparations is one that is personal to me given that my family suffered during the horrific events of World War II. Most notably my great uncle and his family hid a number of Jewish families on his farm from the German occupiers, unfortunately, they were discovered and their farm was surrounded.\\nMy great uncle returned to the farm and his neighbours warned him to stay away; he refused to leave his wife and daughter behind and instead went to the farm. Upon arriving, the Germans made him remove his officer’s boots, dig his own grave and then watch as they shot his 13-year-old daughter, then his wife before finally killing him.\\nWhat is less known today is that, under Nazi occupation, Poland was the only country where you could receive the death penalty simply for helping a Jewish family. My great uncle and his family knew that and still they took the risk because they knew that it was the right thing to do.\\nGiven my family’s sacrifices, I feel passionately that all victims of World War II should be adequately compensated. To this end I would like to ask that you, and your colleagues, join my campaign to ask that Germany pay proper war reparations to Poland. This would allow us to right not one, but two historical wrongs by ensuring that Germany properly compensates Poland for the years of misery inflicted upon her and that victims of the Holocaust that are still alive can be properly reimbursed.\\nMember of Parliament for Shrewsbury and Atcham',\n",

Many proteins are challenging to express in heterologous expression systems. Various factor contribute to this problem. It is often difficult for the foreign host to fold a protein correctly it does not normally produce. For instance, many scenarios expression of a protein which is originated from high eukaryote is produced in a bacterium where factors such as translation rate, codon usage and redox potential are different. In addition, inherent properties of target protein shows challenges for the expression host. For instance, a protein which have several membrane spanning domains which might not insert into membrane bilayers of the heterologous host or protein which cannot be expressed in a soluble form. Many proteins requires post-translational modifications which are absent or may be different from host to host.\\nDownload sample copy of this report:\\nDifficult-to-Express Proteins: Market Dynamics\\nWith growing demand for production of recombinant proteins in cells, low protein yields have significant consequences in the industrial.

       " {'text': 'There are many different ways to analyze current astrological events. The discipline of astrology studies cycles within cycles. In order to do this, it is necessary to take a moment in time and analyze the position of the planets at that moment. Some moments in time pass quickly while others impact longer periods. Whenever the Sun enters one of the Cardinal Signs, which are Aries, Cancer, Libra, and Capricorn, the chart for that entry or ingress impacts the entire season to come.\\nThe reason for this is that if we are using the Tropical Zodiac, the Cardinal Signs begin on the equinoxes and the solstices. The equinoxes are when the length of day and night are equal, and the solstices are the extreme points with respect to the length of day or night. The Sun’s ingress into Capricorn marks the shortest day in the Northern Hemisphere, or the Winter Solstice and the longest day in the Southern Hemisphere, or the Summer Solstice. The chart for the Capricorn Ingress will color events until the Spring in the Northern Hemisphere or the Fall in the Southern Hemisphere.\\nWith that in mind, let us look at the Capricorn Ingress of 2018.\\nWhen looking at an Ingress chart, it is important to realize that it will look different depending on where you live. I cast this chart for where I live. The planets will all be in the same place no matter where you are, but the Ascendant, Midheaven, Part of Fortune, and the Houses the planets fall in will vary. For this reason, I will only analyze the planetary placements. Also, for those who are interested, the wheel that I used has the Egyptian term rulers on the outer circle. Term rulerships are one of the Essential Dignities used in Classical Astrology.\\nMercury Conjunct Jupiter and Antares\\nOne of the first things to notice is that Mercury has just joined Jupiter in Sagittarius and is barely starting to separate from that conjunction. Both planets are conjunct the Fixed Star Antares. Jupiter is the dominant of the two planets both as the ruler of Sagittarius, the triplicity ruler of Fire, and the term ruler of the degree of Sagittarius that they are in. Mercury is debilitated in Sagittarius but does have a small amount of dignity as the face ruler of the first 10 degrees of this sign.\\nOn its own, this configuration would give a jovial and carefree stamp to this chart. Yet, the Fixed Star Antares changes the meaning quite a bit.\\nAntares is one of the four Royal Stars of Persia and is the Watcher of the West. This star sits in the constellation of Scorpio and is known as the Heart of the Scorpion. As a Royal Star, this adds great power to the conjunction, but it also adds quite a bit of depth and a bit of a darker quality. In many ways, Antares adds a strong Scorpionic quality to this conjunction.\\nBoth Mercury and Jupiter are applying to a square with Neptune, and of course, Mercury moves faster, so will perfect the square first.\\nThis is likely to manifest in the exposure of things that had been hidden and bringing them to the surface. While this will happen primarily on a larger level within politics and world events, it will also impact many on a personal level. The people who will feel the greatest impact of this are those with planets and chart points in the middle degrees of the Mutable Signs, Gemini, Virgo, Sagittarius, and Pisces.\\nVenus has just gone past a trine with Neptune, which gives further testimony that any willingness we had to cover up illusions and let them slide is now over.\\nSaturn in Capricorn\\nSaturn has been in Capricorn since around this time last year. This year Saturn is moving into the middle of this sign and is moving in to form a sextile with Neptune. While a sextile is generally an easy aspect, in this case, just touching Neptune in Pisces will add to the testimony of illusions being uncovered with hard and cold reality.\\nBy definition, at the Capricorn Ingress, the Sun is moving into Capricorn. The Sun has a very wide orb, so it already in conjunction with Saturn. This means that it will be time to get to work. The good news is that this will give a lot of energy for practical endeavors, even though it will not necessarily be a lot of fun.\\nThe Capricorn Ingress will take place the day before the Full Moon. The Full Moon of December 22, 2018 was discussed in the transits article for this month. In this chart, however, it is still in the 1st Quarter phase.\\nThis means that this season will see things develop and reach maturity. The Moon is still in Gemini, which lightens up a very serious chart.\\nOn the other hand, the path of the Moon goes from a square with Neptune to a square with Mars. This seems to be even more testimony to the theme of challenging illusions.\\nWhat Does All of this Mean?\\nA rather clear theme has emerged from this Capricorn Ingress. This next season will be a time of getting to the heart of things and confronting any illusions or delusions that we may be living under.\\nWhile this may sound unpleasant, overall, it is likely to be very healing. This will be a time of cleansing and getting down to business. Even though some of this will be hard and serious, if we do what is being asked of us, we are likely to reap great rewards. While we do have the taskmaster, Saturn fixing us with her stern gaze, we also have the kindly Jupiter ready and waiting to give us all manner of blessings and good things.',\n",

       " {'text': 'Meghan’s Picture Perfect Royal Wedding Day Make-up, Hair and Nails\\nToday we’re taking a deeper look at Meghan’s much-discussed wedding day hair and makeup.\\nFrom the palace press release —\\nMs. Markle’s hair was styled by Serge Normant, with make-up by long-time friend and make-up artist Daniel Martin.”\\nThe ‘messy bun’ style updo and freckle-baring makeup were a classically Meghan look. These are familiar styles we’ve come to know and love (some more than others), and are already a signature look for the new Duchess.\\nNew York-based makeup artist Daniel Martin has known Meghan since 2011. He is currently a Brand Ambassador for Dior Beauty and the Creative Color Consultant for Honest Beauty. He told Glamour that the process with Meghan was very collaborative, and the two worked with the keywords, “timeless, effortless, and chic”.\\nIn an interview with Elle Magazine, Martin shared a very cute story of how it came to be that he was responsible for Meghan’s wedding day face —\\nShe sent me a text asking what I was doing the weekend of May 19th. I was like, “I may be in Cannes for the film festival but what’s up…” and she sent me the bride and groom emoji right back and I literally dropped my phone! Then she sent me the shhhh emoji back so I couldn’t let anyone know…”\\nFrom his Instagram account, this lovely illustration and caption:\\nShe’s extremely decisive… She’s very open and loves makeup.”\\nTo Glamour, he added that —\\nShe’s very much about keeping her skin as real and natural as possible. Meghan has incredible skin. I started by prepping her skin with a clarifying toner, water-based moisturizer, and a Korean sunscreen that also acts as a foundation gripper to lock down foundation. Then I just balanced and neutralized any discolorations where needed with concealer and foundation.”\\nUPDATED: Tatcha Silken Pore Perfecting Sunscreen, SPF 35 is a great option for sunscreen under makeup and this is a brand that both Daniel and Meghan favor — According to Tatcha, it is a lightweight mineral sunscreen that provides broad-spectrum SPF 35 protection from UVA and UVB rays with pure, skin-loving ingredients. Perfect as a primer for makeup.\\nAnother primer from Tatcha that Daniel has been seen using is The Silk Canvas.\\nAccording to a number of reports Daniel Martin used Dior’s new Backstage Face & Body Foundation on Meghan.\\nFrom NewBeauty.com —\\n…it secretly made its debut last month in Windsor. That’s right, Meghan Markle’s wedding day foundation of choice—which we all know showed off her natural freckles—was none other than the new Backstage Face & Body Foundation ($40) from the French brand. According to Dior Beauty’s creative and image director of makeup Peter Philips, Daniel Martin used the line’s hero product on the Duchess of Sussex for her big day, making this collection royal-approved.”\\nThis new makeup collection from Dior, a less-expensive makeup line from the brand, launches at Sephora and Sephora.com on June 15.\\nPeter Philips told Harper’s Bazaar —\\nIt’s my key product. I wanted 16 different levels of intensity but above all, 6 different skin undertones: rosy, olive, yellow, beige, etc. in total that makes 40 colors, allowing every woman to find the shade that best matches her complexion”\\nThe only touch-ups required throughout the day were blotting papers and lipstick, although on the ‘lipstick’ note, Martin said —\\nI made sure her lips were well hydrated, but I opted for a tinted lip balm that gave color without looking like heavy lipstick. We wanted a natural flush.”\\nWith this description, Martin’s position at Dior, and the look of Meghan’s lips on the day, I’d bet good money the product used was one of Dior’s cult favourite Addict Lip Glows. Walking the divide between a lipstick and a balm, the product is popular for its buildable colours, hydration and lasting power. The brand released new shades earlier this year, which react to the wearer’s body pH and chemistry to transform to a custom shade while on the lips. While undoubtedly very, very cool, this makes it quite hard to discern what colour Meghan might’ve worn(!).\\nSee that sheen on Meghan’s cheekbone and decolletage in the image above? Martin also said he used the same luminizer across face and body. While neither he nor hairstylist Serge Normant were able to disclose any specific products used on Meghan to the media, as a beauty devotee and highlighter junkie, I do have a guess or three here. Makeup artist Lydia Sellers has mentioned using the cult favourite RMS Living Luminizer on Meghan in the past (RMS is an organic, non-toxic brand right up Meghan’s alley), she told Byrdie —\\nThis highlighter is a favourite when working with Meghan because of its subtlety; it doesn’t go on looking like a disco ball, but it has just enough pop to make her skin glow in a natural, dewy way.”\\nNow with the launch of the Backstage collection, we are thinking that Daniel Martin may have also used Dior Backstage Glow Face Palette.\\nMeghan’s eyes were done in “smokey” effect and we have a great shot of her lids to get a peek at the overall look! We’re thinking that the shadow used was also from the new Backstage collection in Warm Neutrals. Another great palette is the Dior 5 Colouers Eyeshadow in 647 Undress.\\nUPDATE: We have this update from Dior PR on Meghan’s Royal Wedding Day makeup direct from the brand —\\nNow to the famous and hotly-debated ceremony hairstyle by Serge Normant. The France-born, New York-based hairstylist works with a large number of celebrity clients, as well as being renowned in the fashion and beauty industries for his work in editorial and advertising. Meghan met Normant in 2017, and collaborated closely with him to devise the day’s updo. He spoke with The Daily Mail afterward.\\nWe worked really closely together but there was nothing contrived about it. We wanted something that wasn’t effortless and really timeless. As long as it didn’t look contrived… She had a pretty good input. We came around with boards and tried to figure out what would be the easiest thing to do.”\\nNormant doesn’t shy away from the oft-critiqued ‘messy’ label, telling The Daily Mail —\\nIt’s a messy bun, we call it. Messy in a controlled way,’ he said. ‘Making sure it doesn’t become a whole mess after a few hours! He said the style wasn’t about ‘reinvention’, wanting to stick with Meghan’s ‘usual angle’. Despite the criticisms, Meghan clearly feels very comfortable with the relaxed style. Normant told Glamour, “I know everyone’s fixating on the word messy, but it was more like unstructured volume. A low bun in the back with dimension. I love it when a bun has asymmetry here or there, like one side is bigger than the other. I wanted it to feel almost like she did it herself… We both knew we wanted to do something very loose in the back and soft in the front.”\\nAs for working with Queen Mary’s Filigree Tiara – a piece I’m sure is out of the comfort zone of most fashion industry hairstylists – Normant said the hairstyle was dependent on the piece.\\nit [the style] had to work with both the veil and the tiara, so I didn’t want too much volume on the top.”\\nMore from the Glamour piece:\\nIt’s not that bad,” Normant says of its weight. “I mean, it was a beautiful, beautiful piece. It was a dream to work with it. Now I wish every girl I have to work with from now on would have a tiara, because it was just so amazing. She showed it to me, and I loved it instantly. It’s from 1932, can you imagine? It’s that old. And it looks beyond. It fit perfectly on her.”\\nMeghan’s hair for the evening reception was by a different stylist, London-based George Northwood. The style was far more casual, a higher, more typical bun and loose strands, a great complement to the Stella McCartney gown.\\nUPDATE 21 June:\\nNow to one of the smallest, but perhaps most important details of the day – nails. With no official word on Meghan’s nail polish colour or manicurist, here we enter the very fun world of pure imagination. Susan C and I have had wonderful back-and-forths with swatches of different shades from brands we know Meghan favours, plus some wildcards.\\nThe colour was a pale pink, very opaque, with a very glossy finish.\\nThanks to our follower, Andrea, who mentioned she thought she saw a post by Meghan’s BFF Jessica Mulroney and wedding nails, we were able to find this May 14, 2018 post below from Jessica’s Instagram account and CND nail polish!\\nWe then found in the same post where a follower asks what color the Duchess was wearing on the day of the wedding to which it looks like CND replies! Could this be the color? —\\nWhile the color in the image, Unmasked, appears to be a pink, it is actually more of a beige when it goes on.\\nInterestingly enough, CND Canada announced on their Instagram account their new partnership with Jessica on May 15th —\\nFrom the CND site, the colors are from the Spring 2018 Nude Collection and are an opaque polish.\\nUnmasked is a pale beige, Uncovered is a sheer peach, Unlocked is pink lavender hue and Unearthed is a tan. In the image below of Meghan’s nails, they appear to have almost a satin gloss finish which would be closer to the above Unlocked shade. While a second color could have been used such as the brand’s Beau or Negligee (both colours Susan C. has tried).\\nAnyone of these colors make a nice selection for a bride.\\nSusan C. prefers the more sheer shades —\\nI’ve ruled out the heavier opaque CND polishes for Meghan, like Cake Pop and Naked Naivete. Both have a heavy “white” base to them and Cake Pop is very bubblegum looking in my opinion. I am leaning more towards the thought that Meghan is wearing two shades of CND polishes which is a common trend. It’s possible she is wearing one of the new Nude Collection shades with a coat of Negligee over the top or even the Beau color which is a bit more iridescent. I would need to experiment a bit to see how it looks in the sunlight and indoors.”\\nUPDATE: Susan C. has received the new CND Nude Collection and after trying the colours — Uncovered, Unmasked and Unlocked mentioned above — Unmasked is an opaque beige and does not appear to match Meghan’s polish color. Uncovered is a sheer peach colour and similar to colours of polish that Meghan has worn recently. Unlocked is an opaque pink/lavender shade and closer to the polish that Meghan is wearing on the Royal Wedding day. There is also that possibility that the colour was combined with one other CND polish such as Negligee.\\nThere is a lot of speculation online that the colour is Essie’s Ballet Slippers. The shade was created for HM in 1989 and has been a staple royal colour since. However, we just don’t think that this was the colour Meghan wore. On Essie’s website, the model shot shows a clear colour difference between the nail bed and tip. Ballet Slippers is a very sheer colour, which would have to be layered with an opaque underneath to achieve Meghan’s look. Doing this is plausible – but unlikely.\\nMeghan wore the Rimmel shade, Ivory Tower, for her Vanity Fair shoot late last year, so Susan C wagers its possible (if not probable) she’s remained loyal to the brand. Of course, there’s more than a couple of OPI shades that I think fit the bill (my go-to nude is the oddly-named ‘My Very First Knockwurst’, which I think is definitely within the realm of possibility). For that glass-like finish, an industry favourite is Seche Vite, an excellent top coat I keep backup bottles of.\\nBut in the end, I rather enjoyed this Vogue UK article. It ultimately suggests a CND Shellac shade, Cake Pop.\\nI just had a feeling that it was a CND Shellac colour. Knowing from my every-two-weeks Shellac habit, it had to be. What bride wouldn’t opt for a chip-free nail option; especially when two billion are watching? It’s been documented in the past that Meghan has been a client of Nails and Brows in Mayfair. Although they didn’t confirm that they did her nails for the big day, they did tell me that the Duchess likes her nails to be “short, square but slightly rounded on the sides” and chooses “nudes, creams and delicate pinks for a clean, groomed look. I got on the phone to Samantha Sweet, co-founder of Sweet Squared who distribute CND Shellac and who was also adamant it was Shellac.\\nWe ‘think’ but can’t confirm that it looks totally like Cake Pop (but it could be Naked Naivete which is what Victoria (Beckham) was wearing),” she said. “But we think Cake Pop!”\\nFor anyone who can’t commit to the in-salon removal process for shellac (or, like me, has a potentially irrational fear of the UV light used to cure the gel polish), you may be interested in trying the shade at home. CND also sell ‘Vinylux’ – an at-home shellac-like polish which comes in the exact same shade range. Click here for Cake Pop, here for Naked Naivete and here for the top coat – for that requisite high-gloss finish.\\nSusan C. also investigated the CND shades, having already owned some of the polish. Cake Pop (a pink-lavendar based shade) or Naivete (a peach based shade) are both opaque polishes. Negligee (pink shimmer based) and Romantique (ivory based) are two of the brand’s sheer colors.\\nMeghan’s nails appear to have a bit of a satin sheen to them as well. It could be two different shades of polish to create the look.\\nAnd that – phew – is a wrap on the beautiful ‘beauty’ of the wedding.

       " {'text': 'By Joanna Palmer, Resilient Neighborhood Homeowner\\nLast Saturday, my neighbors and I were incredibly touched to see how many people came out to help us install permaculture features in our yards. Around 20 volunteers showed up early on a weekend morning to our block in Vallejo’s Morningside Addition to dig swales, plant trees, mulch and build garden beds.\\nThroughout the day, neighbors kept dropping by to ask what was going on, and in some cases offer to help out — I think I met more people in one day than I have since the first few weeks of moving to the neighborhood. We had snacks and cold drinks to offer them, but hopefully soon we’ll have something more special: homegrown fruit from the many trees Sustainable Solano helped us plant. If all goes according to plan, in a few years they’ll be providing a harvest much bigger than we can possibly consume on our own.\\nSo many things are better when they’re shared: work, food, knowledge. Sustainable Solano’s permaculturists offered an abundance of the latter on Saturday. We learned how to dig a swale to collect rainwater runoff; how to plan a hugelkultur, a raised mound for recycling yard waste that creates great soil; and how to build an herb spiral that creates tiny little microclimates for growing many different plants in a small space.\\nCreating the hugelkultur garden bed at one home and the herb spiral at another\\nMy partner and I are recent transplants from the East Coast, and this project represents a realization of so many of our hopes for moving to California. We were drawn here by the natural beauty, the weather that makes living outdoors year-round so appealing, and the easygoing lifestyle. Vallejo in particular seemed to offer a chance to make our home in one of the few places left in the Bay Area that’s still full of multigenerational families with a community-minded orientation.\\nStrong communities will be essential to thrive in the world that’s coming, and I’m so grateful to Sustainable Solano for providing us with this vehicle to start building one. Over the long term, I hope we can use this project as a foundation for an array of different offerings. I’d love to help develop a food-sharing network, workshops and a hub for disaster-preparedness resources.\\nMore immediately, I’m just really excited to be learning so much.\\nJoanna is part of the Vallejo pilot project in the Resilient Neighborhoods program, which is funded through a grant from the PG&E Corporation Foundation.\\nLearn more about this Resilient Neighborhoods pilot project in Vallejo here.\\nInterested in learning some of these techniques to bring to your own community?\\nRegister for the upcoming workshops at the links below:\\nJune 1: Greywater and Lawn Conversion\\nJune 8: Understory, Drip and Water-Capture Feature\\nJune 15: Swales, Mulch, Trees, Hugelkultur\\nJune 22: Laundry-to-Landscape Greywater Installation\\nJune 29: Understory and Drip Irrigation\\nWe hope to see you there!',\n",

       " {'text': 'In 2016 Britain Stronger in Europe, an umbrella campaign led by the then Conservative prime minister David Cameron, made the argument for Britain’s continued membership of the European Union. At the time of the referendum, Cameron’s unpopularity was rapidly on the increase as the austerity he had imposed on the nation was starting to be felt more widely. His Conservative-led coalition government back-loaded their cuts between 2010 and 2015 so they fell after the 2015 general election – they dropped at the precise time that Cameron ended up calling an EU referendum.\\nIn spite of this, the Remain campaign was not a complete failure. If it had been such a failure, it would not have been such a close result with 52 per cent for and 48 per cent voting against Brexit. Vote Leave could have ended up with a landslide, but it didn’t.\\nThere were many criticisms of that 2016 campaign. It was accused of failing to properly address people’s concerns about immigration. It was too focused on our cities, London in particular. Many advocates of the cause were accused of being part of the “establishment”. The “metropolitan, liberal elite” was the usual invective directed at those on the Remain side of the argument – this is still the case – even by those who think Brexit is a disaster. It never seemed to matter that a Brexit elite composed of public school boys like Boris Johnson and Jacob Rees-Mogg was and is still arrayed on the other side of the argument. Nor did it seem to matter that the whole weight of the trade union movement, representing millions of workers, came in behind the Stronger In campaign too.\\nBut clearly mistakes were made. Stronger In, ideally, would have been built from the bottom up, from the grassroots, and it should have had a clearer and representative collective leadership. The People’s Vote campaign has learned these lessons, as the huge march in London – co-sponsored by The Independent – vividly illustrates in technicolour today. The march takes place following a summer of intense activity in each and every region of the country. We held rallies in Bristol, Edinburgh, Cambridge, Newcastle, Liverpool, Birmingham and had events in countless other areas – events led by local speakers from all walks of life.\\nThe breadth and depth of our campaign means we work across party lines. In the past few weeks, the Conservative MP Anna Soubry and I (we co-chair the All-Party Parliamentary Group on EU Relations) have been campaigning alongside the energetic and dynamic youth organistion For Our Future’s Sake (FFS). We have gone to Manchester, Exeter and Hull in addition to campaigning in our own regions. FFS is one of over 10 groups with hundreds of thousands of activists across the country that all campaign under the #PeoplesVote umbrella. Those on the opposite side of the argument – led by the hard right ERG group of Tory MPs and UKIP – have come nowhere close to matching this grassroots organisation.\\nAnd it is about time that the “metropolitan, liberal elite” smear was properly dealt with once and for all. I’m fed up hearing about it. I’ve heard it said about the community I am from and represent, which scored the highest Remain vote in the country. We are proud to have “liberal” values which respect and embrace difference, and uphold the rule of law. We don’t think being a diverse “metropolitan” area composed of people of different races or religions is something to be ashamed of or makes our voice any less valid or, indeed, authentic.\\nLet me tell you: Lambeth is not some “elite”. One in four people lives in absolute poverty. More than half of our residents do not own their own home. We are the eighth most deprived local authority in England and we have some of the most acute social problems, such as domestic violence and substance abuse, in the country. Like so many areas that voted Leave, many in our area have also not seen the benefits of globalisation and have found themselves at the rough end of a dysfunctional economy. The only difference is that we do not believe that leaving the European Union will improve or address the problems we face – we believe it will exacerbate them.\\nSure, there will be some individuals who might fit the stereotype painted of the People’s Vote movement but it is not a fair representation of the overall campaign which is a complete cross-section of the country. As Richard Brooks, one of the co-founders of FFS, said this week: “I personally grew up in a working-class home, raised by a single parent in council housing – as have many other FFS campaigners.\\n“The grim reality is that for every 10 excellent pieces of campaigning young working-class kids do, they will always get drowned out by celebs – because that’s what the media pick up. The same media who then complain about over saturation of posh people in the Brexit debate.\\n“I’ve spent the last six months supporting working-class young people from diverse backgrounds, getting their voices heard in the media, and I have to say, nine out of 10, when offered, those voices are rejected [by the media].”\\nBrooks’ comments will be borne out by what you will see on the streets of London on Saturday with over 150 coaches bringing people from every region to march on Westminster and demand they get a say on how and whether we leave the EU.\\nIn particular, over 2 million young people have not had a chance to vote on Brexit yet – that’s why they will be at the front of the march, leading the charge. Above all it’s a march for their futures.\\nChuka Umunna is the Labour MP for Streatham',\n",

       " {'text': 'Space-saving design. High rated key-switch life. Nifty light-up USB connector.\\nMild feature set for the price. Backlighting level doesn\\'t crank high enough. Some key lighting can\\'t be suppressed. No dedicated media keys or supporting software.\\nCherry\\'s \"tenkeyless\" MX 1.0 TKL mechanical keyboard delivers an on-point typing experience but not much in the way of features for the money, given the abbreviated layout.\\nCherry holds a unique position in the mechanical keyboard market. Technically, it\\'s among the most influential and powerful companies in it; it designs and produces the mindshare-leading Cherry MX mechanical key switches—the hardware under each key—that end up inside of other keyboards. Keyboard makers such as Cooler Master, Corsair, and G.Skill use them, imitate them, or use others\\' Cherry-\"style\" switches in their wares. At the same time, Cherry also sells fully finished keyboards in modest volumes. The $99.99 MX Board 1.0 TKL is its latest, a shot at the tenkeyless (\"TKL\") space that boomed a few years back among the higher-profile keyboard makers. It\\'s a niche model that delivers comfy-enough typing, but it\\'s otherwise unremarkable. Seek it out after a $20 or $30 haircut off its list price.\\nGive Me Ten...or Rather, Don\\'t\\nFirst, the TKL: Simply put, a \"tenkeyless\" keyboard lops off the number-key portion of the board to save space. The compact MX Board 1.0 TKL does this, reducing the overall width to 14.6 inches, and is made almost entirely out of plastic. The only metal to be found here is in the undercarriage. The lack of a metal top plate and the need for fewer pricey mechanical key switches than a full-size board, in theory, should push down the cost of manufacture and thus the price. (More on that later.)\\nThe plastic is quite sturdy, and it doesn\\'t give way at all when pressed. Holding the keyboard from opposing ends, I attempted to twist it to see how well it would hold up. It was rigid and inflexible, suggesting a hardy undercarriage.\\nI can\\'t say for sure that the MX Board 1.0 TKL is the absolute lightest tenkeyless mechanical keyboard out there, but in vetting competing products, it was the lightest I spotted, at 1.7 pounds. Most competing models come in closer to (or above) 2 pounds. The compact design and reasonable weight could even make this keyboard decent for travel or LAN-party lugging.\\nCherry offers this keyboard with gamer-minded MX Red switches. These are hair-trigger switches geared toward gamers looking for speed and a light touch. (See our mechanical keyboard guide for a deeper dive into different switch types, which are usually designated by color.) These keys are rated to work for a minimum of 50 million keypresses and here are equipped with white LEDs.\\nThe LEDs aren\\'t particularly bright, and even cranked up, they come off as a little dull in a well-lit room. They are bright enough to help you see while typing in the dark, to be sure, but they are among the dimmest LEDs I\\'ve seen on a mechanical keyboard to date. The light level is adjustable, but the level differences are slight.\\nCherry doesn\\'t supply any supplemental software for this keyboard. This model is strictly plug-and-play and works with Windows\\' keyboard settings, as well as any that are in-program or in-game. You don\\'t get any shortcut keys for media-playback control, in the form of either dedicated keys or key combos. The few shortcut commands (strictly in hardware and executed as key combinations) control the audio volume and the brightness of the keyboard\\'s LEDs.\\nSpeaking of the key-lighting behavior, it\\'s also worth noting that some of the LEDs on the keyboard are brighter than others. Four keys in particular stand out: the Windows key, the Menu key, the Scroll Lock key, and the Caps Lock key. These keys don\\'t adhere to the adjustable brightness settings and remain illuminated even when all other LEDs on the board have been turned off. The LEDs on the Scroll Lock and Caps Lock keys toggle on and off to indicate if these features are active or not, which is sensible, but I can\\'t grok any major reason for the Windows and Menu keys to remain illuminated at all times.\\nYou\\'ll also notice a white LED on the actual USB connector that goes into the attached computer. (It illuminates a Cherry logo.) This LED, similarly, is not under your control, but it\\'s not exceedingly bright or bothersome. In most cases, it will be hidden in the cable clutter behind a PC tower; at least this will help you identify the keyboard cable on sight.\\nThe MX Board 1.0 TKL has full support for N-key rollover, letting you mash as many keys as you like at once. Other than these features, typical of most gaming mechanical keyboards, the MX Board 1.0 TKL lacks other features of note.\\nTKL: Hands-On and Face-Off\\nThe typing experience on Cherry\\'s MX Board 1.0 TKL is pleasant but unremarkable among Cherry MX Red boards I\\'ve used. The keys have adequate travel distance—the same I\\'ve felt on other MX Red boards—and it\\'s fairly easy to type lightly without bottoming out. This is great for swift typists looking to reduce finger fatigue, again in line with what I\\'ve come to expect from other keyboards with these switches. PC gamers too tend to favor MX Red switches for their speed advantage, but the lack of supporting software, dedicated macro keys, and gamer gewgaws make the TKL a better fit for the speed-typing set.\\nFor some reason, possibly because of the all-plastic chassis or the composition of the keycaps, the keys on the MX Board 1.0 TKL produce more noise than some other Cherry MX Red-equipped keyboards I\\'ve used. My daily driver is G.Skill\\'s Ripjaws KM780 MX in Cherry MX Red, but it is in general less noisy than this keyboard. (See our review of the similar G.Skill Ripjaws KM780 RGB.)\\nAs we alluded to in the introduction, Cherry will face stiff competition in the current market from feature-loaded, price-agressive models. These are from the likes of Corsair, Kingston (in its HyperX brand), Logitech, and Razer, among many others. For example, Kingston\\'s tenkeyless HyperX Alloy FPS Pro is available with either Cherry MX Blue or Cherry MX Red switches at a substantially lower list price of $80 and, at this writing, a street price $10 less than that.\\nCorsair\\'s Vengeance K65 RGB tenkeyless is older and considerably heavier, but it has fallen in street price enough to bring it within striking distance of the Cherry\\'s MSRP. It\\'s backed by better (and RGB) lighting and sophisticated programming software in the form of Corsair\\'s Corsair Utility Engine (CUE). The newer K65 Lux RGB is also within price parity, or close to it, occasionally dropping below $100. Both of these CUE-backed keyboards can be had with Cherry MX Red switches and sport a number of fixed-function multimedia buttons.\\nAnother key competitor is Logitech\\'s G Pro. It is selling at this writing for a bit over $100, which is slightly above the MX Board 1.0 TKL\\'s MSRP, but the G Pro has a lot more to offer. It doesn\\'t use Cherry switches, but Logitech homebrews called \"Romer-G.\" These are rated for more keypresses (70 million) and have RGB LEDs. Plus, you get some dedicated media buttons and mature tweaking/utility software.\\nThis Cherry? Not Quite a Peach\\nIn short, those few tenkeyless examples should make it clear: At neither its MSRP ($99.99) nor its current street price (about $90) is the MX Board 1.0 TKL particularly competitive. In one corner is this mostly plastic keyboard with plain-white LEDs, no software, and no special features. It\\'s poised to duke it out with mechanical keyboards clad, in some cases, in part metal, with much beefier feature sets and not-far-off prices.\\nUnless you need the lightest keyboard possible or just want to keep it simple, Cherry\\'s board just doesn\\'t carry enough clout for the money. Wait for a price drop, or set your sights higher.',\n",

       " {'text': \"Caltrain CBOSS PTC Project\\nCaltrain is currently working on the Caltrain Communications Based Overlay Signal System (CBOSS) Positive Train Control (PTC) Project to develop a new advanced signal system. The Caltrain CBOSS PTC Project will meet two specific criteria:\\n- Meet the Federal mandate to implement PTC by 2015; and\\n- Increase system capacity to allow for future increases in ridership demand.\\nBenefits from PTC\\nThe Caltrain CBOSS PTC Project will include PTC requirements as federally mandated by the Railroad Safety Improvement Act of 2008, which requires the installation of PTC on all commuter railroads and some freight railroads by 2015. PTC helps to eliminate train-to-train collisions and over-speed mishaps (trains exceeding the civil speed limit). The train will be automatically stopped when there is a violation of speed or when there is a violation of route. It also provides additional safety for railroad workers on the tracks and requires interoperability between all rail services operating on the same tracks. This interoperability assures compliance among all vehicles using the same tracks with the PTC system. This is important for Caltrain as other operators on Caltrain tracks include commuter rail, freight, and future high-speed rail.\\nAdditional CBOSS Benefits for Caltrain\\nThe Caltrain CBOSS PTC Project also specifies additional capabilities to enable increased safety and operating performance for Caltrain and future high-speed rail service. These additional benefits include:\\n- Increased operating performance of the current signal system, enabling more frequent and more dependable passenger service to meet growing demand.\\n- Improved grade crossing warning functions.\\n- Integrated communication among all subsystems (such as the central control facility, train and wayside) for improved safety performance for highway vehicles and the riding public.\\n- Safe operations between Caltrain and other tenant railroads including future high-speed rail.\\nThe most crucial factor constraining the current capacity Caltrain is the wayside signal system. In early 2008, Caltrain began the Caltrain CBOSS PTC Project to develop advanced signal system requirements that include PTC core safety functions and operational performance enhancements to overcome the constraints imposed by the current conventional wayside signaling and crossing warning systems to enable future service increases.\\nElectrification & High Speed Rail Benefits The Caltrain CBOSS PTC Project will be designed to work with Caltrain's existing diesel-based service and will also be compatible with future plans to electrify the Caltrain system. The Caltrain CBOSS PTC Project allows Caltrain to fully utilize the high-performance capabilities of its future electric-powered fleet. Caltrain is also working in coordination with the California High Speed Rail Authority to ensure that the project is compatible with future high-speed rail service. California voters approved the high-speed rail bond proposition on Nov. 4, 2008, and state high-speed rail officials have designated the Caltrain corridor as the alignment between San Jose and San Francisco.\\n- Critical design: Present – Fall 2012\\n- Final design: Fall 2012 - Spring 2013\\n- Installation and Testing: Spring 2013 – 2015\\n- Begin revenue service: Fall 2015\\n|PTG Base Contract with Fiber Option||\\n|JPB Project Management Oversight and Other Direct Costs (ODCs) including Taxes and Facility Lease||\\n|Options and Allowance (Spectrum purchase, additional Warranty, spares, etc)||\\n10/25/2011 - choy\\nYou can now receive Caltrain news via e-mail!\\nCaltrain Twitter is human-operated M-F, 7am to 7pm, excluding holidays.\",\n",

       " {'text': 'BANFF, Alta. — System builders have lost more white box business to notebooks than to tier one PC manufacturers who sell direct, according to a senior Intel executive.\\nSpeaking at the System Builder Breakaway this week, director of Intel\\nchannels and distribution Steve Dallman said Intel wants to change that trend with its Centrino line of chips. The company has also partnered with OEM design manufacturers Asus, Aopen, and FIC to help white box builders to start delivering white box notebooks, or whitebooks.\\nThese companies will provide system builders with whitebook spindles. The system builder will add the CPU, memory and DVD or CD drive.\\n“”Intel understands this market will not happen overnight,”” Dallman said, adding that the chipmaker wants to create a whitebook ecosystem made up of distributors, OEMs and VARs by April.\\nDallman predicts that within a year the whitebook market will become viable. Gary Sohal, president of Hamilton, Ont-based system builder Audcomp Computer Systems, isn’t so sure.\\n“”(Whitebooks) are too new. No one can build a whitebook that is priced lower than a clone PC. That is why it has not taken off,”” Sohal said.\\nAudcomp has dabbled with whitebooks in the past with Asus and Daiwa, but Sohal said the price was only $200 less than tier one notebooks. He said that was not enough of a delta for businesses to take a chance with whitebooks.\\nSohal said he does see some potential for whitebooks in the consumer market. “”Home PCs that do mundane tasks today will be passed down to the kids, while the parents will use a whitebook because people want to be outside computing with wireless,”” he said.\\nDallman said the Canadian commercial notebook market grew 17 per cent, while the consumer market grew 21 per cent. “”All in a bad year,”” he said. Dallman believes notebook growth will continue because of wireless technology.\\nAccording to Intel, 50 per cent of the installed base in is older than three years. Last year that percentage was at 33 per cent.\\n“”If I say to a client to change 33 per cent of their PCs, they will shoot me,”” he said. “”But if you have 30 machines you can upgrade 15 to 20 per cent of them. That is only five or six machines and then they can take the most productive people ‘s machines and ship those machines down (to none power users),”” he said.\\nDallman also said that 250 million PC still run Windows 95/8 and use lower than 500 MHz system. Windows 95 is no longer support and Microsoft has said that they will no longer support Windows 98 in 2004.\\nThese will all be reasons to upgrade, Dallman said. Intel has unveiled an educational program called Ignite to help the channel understand Windows obsolesce and the security (virus) issues that can arise.',\n",

       " {'text': 'AT Kearney’s recent Kearney ‘Mobilising for Supply Chain Excellence’ report found less than one in ten companies could be considered supply chain leaders, with many more toiling away for little or no return.\\nSupply chain leaders and executives that are failing to excel in the area of external spending – which typically makes up 30% of revenues for service companies and half of revenues for manufacturing firms – could be driving their firms into the clutches of its completion or even onto the business scrapheap.\\nThat’s the verdict from a recent study by AT Kearney ‘Mobilising for Supply Chain Excellence’ found that just 7% of companies can be considered to \"demonstrate excellent supply chain capabilities\", delivering around $13 for every $1 spent on supply chain management assets.\\nAt the other end of the scale, more than a quarter (27%) of firms are barely covering their costs, returning $1 or less for every $1 spent on supply chain management assets. Between the two ends of the spectrum, 55% - dubbed ‘the pack’ are adding value, but not transforming fast enough, while 11% are producing solid results and are making significant strides to becoming leaders.\\nSpeaking to Supply Chain Digital, Mike Hales, a partner in A.T. Kearney\\'s Operations Practice and one of the report’s authors says that teams and execs that have proven the value of efficient, effective and innovative procurement operations have found themselves catapulted into rarefied air in the world of business, leaving their struggling counterparts in the distance.\\n“It used to be that purchasing was purely a clerical transactional thing, and for some companies it\\'s really advanced to being a strategic function where the head of procurement directly reports to the CEO – they\\'ve got a seat at the executive table. But for the majority of the companies, they just haven\\'t really grabbed a hold of the potential,” he comments.\\n“It\\'s really hard to be great if you\\'re not excellent at managing your largest cost. It\\'s like competing with both arms tied behind your back. When you look at that last quarter (27%) of companies, they’re don\\'t even pay for themselves, they’re returning a dollar or less a value for the dollar they cost the organisation. So, they could disappear and it wouldn’t impact the company’s bottom line in a negative way.\\n“If you really want to be successful as a company, you have to be great in this area because it will drive your EBIT, you P&L which will drive your share price It can impact your earnings per share, your working capital, and so on.”\\nWhereas in some industry sectors, the secret to success can be a challenging puzzle to solve, AT Kearney’s study found that the leading companies shared a number of common synergies: building and managing high-performance teams; managing categories; and managing suppliers.\\nHales continues: “We found that three-quarters of the leaders were able to move 70% of their employees that were in the procurement group from transactional to strategic activities. Most of the typically position 30% of their procurement team on strategic and 70% still stuck in transactional and tactical activities. That’s a really important benchmark for companies to aspire to.”\\nThe report found that the leading lights have embraced digital technology to automate away some of the labour intensive transactional activities, freeing up their best procurement experts to work on strategy and work towards integrating emerging technology into their day-to-day operations.\\nHales reveals: “We made an effort this time to identify a range of hot topics or emerging investment areas for companies that would try to understand whether companies were going to do anything about block chain, and if they were what level of resourcing were they going to put against it. So again, we were able to show that the leaders were like two or three times more likely to be investing and putting resources and expecting a high impact in those areas that were going to lean more to innovation and understanding the impact of technology on procurement and their enterprise. Those companies clearly have a very forward-looking view.\\nContinuing the theme, Hales comments: “So many procurement groups still think their mission is done when they get a contract signed. But the leaders realise that they need to monetise and improve that full life cycle with the supplier. Not just sign the contract, but then making sure to get compliance to it, and then driving a value beyond what you signed up in the contract because the contracts just represent the minimum of what you want from that agreement.\\n“Three years from now the leaders are expecting innovation to be a more important performance metric within the cost. So currently, cost is more important than innovation, but three years from now, most of the leaders are saying innovation is going to be more important than cost. And you\\'re only going to get that if you find a way to work with suppliers. You can\\'t compete your way to innovation with the suppliers because you won\\'t have that trust.”\\nIn addition, those companies struggling to provide return on their supply chain spend could become targets for acquisitionally-minded competitors or private equity firms, Hales says.\\n“There is a lot of private equity activity and mergers and acquisition (M&A) going on; companies that don’t improve that ratio are likely to be on the wrong end of some of those deals,” he comments.\\n“We see the role of procurement soaring in the M&A area because it’s a unique opportunity to combine strands of companies and take them to market in a shortened period of time. Part of the playbook of private equity firms is invest in strategic sourcing as soon as they’ve bought a company. It’s a really quick win for them.”\\nThe best way for CPOs in companies with under-performing procurement operations to drive change is to attempt to prove the returns that can be achieved to their CEOs and CFOs, Hales adds.\\n“Companies in that lower quartile are not intentionally hurting themselves, it’s just that the leadership is not prioritising procurement enough,” he says.\\n“The path for them [CPOs] is to find a way carry out a focused strategic sourcing programme to really demonstrate that they can return more than $1 for every $1 spent. Once that is proven, they can begin to implement a real step-change.”',\n",

       " {'text': 'Open science – broadly, the idea that scientific papers, data and materials should be freely available and accessible to all – is an easy concept to talk about, but a difficult one to put into practice. That’s because it requires effort; individual scientists have to invest extra time and money in making code readable and data accessible, and be ready to deal with criticisms of – and in extreme cases, attacks on – their work. It’s made all the more difficult by the fact that sharing data and materials isn’t the current de facto standard across many scientific disciplines. So why bother going against the grain, if all it’s going to cause is grief and extra work?\\nIt’s important, because transparency is fundamental to good scientific practice. No scientist is perfect, and it’s entirely normal to expect that genuine mistakes can creep into analysis scripts, or in data files themselves. By allowing others to access these sorts of materials, errors can be identified - or in extreme cases, academic fraud can be uncovered – and the scientific record can be corrected. But there’s more to open science than this. Allowing other scientists access to your data might result in new avenues of research to be uncovered, and for unanticipated discoveries to be made. And in some situations, it can even help avoid bizarre run-ins with the legal system.\\nWhile the theoretical case for open science is easy to make, practically getting scientists to make those changes is less trivial. Over the past few years, initiatives such as the Transparency and Openness Promotion Guidelines, Open Science Foundation badges, and study preregistration have been developed to encourage scientists to adopt open practices. These drives have been very successful in driving top-down change, by encouraging journals to adopt new policies and practices. But what about bottom-up approaches to the problem of promoting open science?\\nOn Wednesday, a new paper published in Royal Society Open Science argued for a new, grassroots approach to this problem, by putting the power back into the hands of scientists at the coalface of research, by changing the way that we think about the peer review process (full disclosure: both myself and fellow Head Quarters blogger Chris Chambers are co-authors on the paper). The Peer Reviewers’ Openness (PRO) Initiative is, at its core, a simple pledge: scientists who sign up to the initiative agree that, from January 1 2017, will not offer to comprehensively review, or recommend the publication of, any scientific research papers for which the data, materials and analysis code are not publicly available, or for which there is no clear reason as to why these things are not available. To date, over 200 scientists have signed the pledge.\\nAt face value, some might argue that the pledge might seem a little heavy-handed, but the aim here isn’t to boycott the peer review process. Instead, the aim is to encourage a more open discussion between manuscript authors and peer reviewers in order to provide clearer information on why data and materials may or may not be freely available. In many cases, there are justifiable reasons as to why it would be inappropriate to publish data – for instance, if the study is about a very specific set of people with a rare medical disorder, it may still be possible to identify individuals from anonymised data. But regardless of whether or not the materials and data are publicly available, there should always be a clear justification as to why (or why not) within the paper itself. As long as reviewers are happy with the justification, the review process can go on as usual.\\nThe PRO Initiative isn’t a panacea that will magically solve all of the issues surrounding open science overnight – but then again, it’s not meant to be. What it does do is provide scientists who have a passion for open science to be able to make an actual difference within their discipline at an individual level. On top of this, it ensures that in situations where data and materials aren’t freely available, the reasoning why is detailed in the published scientific record. That sort of information may, in time, be valuable in and of itself in understanding why there is such a culture of secrecy in science.\\nUltimately, the goal of the PRO Initiative is, as Daniël Lakens points out, to get scientists to ask two questions of themselves: Am I able to share my data and research materials? If so, would this be a good thing for my research area? The answers may not be straightforward; nothing in science ever is. But that’s not a reason to shy away from a simple duty that all scientists have – to make sure that the things that we discover about the world around us are real, repeatable, and shared with everyone.',\n",

In fact, all the evidence points to exactly the opposite.\\nWe’ve got goalkeepers with rock-bottom confidence, an uncertain and confused defence, and we’ve kept one clean sheet in the Premier League this season, at home to Wigan.\\nThe continued chopping and changing of De Gea and Lindegaard is extremely frustrating, and to be honest, difficult to fathom.\\nPatrice Evra recently explained that no Manchester United player feels safe from being dropped because there is currently a large squad of talented players all vying for places. As he himself said, perhaps last year there wasn’t enough of a challenge to players in some areas of the squad.\\nCertainly with Evra, this subject has probably been done to death. Throughout last season, I read countless articles and twitter conversations bemoaning the fact that the Frenchman had taken his eye off the ball and was only keeping his place because there was no one else. The arrival of Buttner at the start of this campaign has seen the subject revisited as fans hope that particular issue is now resolved.\\nYes, if a player has a consistent loss of form, and for a run of games leaves fans uttering regular expletives, his place being taken by an exciting back up is an excellent option. Everyone needs a kick up the backside occasionally.\\nBut goalkeepers are different. They don’t run around for 90 minutes twice a week and need a rest, and they don’t need altering to match the other team’s tactics. A keeper’s confidence, form and focus is improved through consistent starts.\\nAdditionally, there is a big difference between three ineffectual games, and one isolated mistake which can instantly leave an important player excluded.\\nTorres open goal misses aside, mistakes are amplified at the back. As a general rule, if a striker misses one obvious chance, he and the team can make another, which he may well go on and score.\\nIf a goalkeeper makes a clanger, it’s probably a goal to the opposition, and the team finds themselves behind. Suddenly the complexion of the game has changed. Ashley Young had a goal chalked off for offside at the weekend, which was much maligned. But in two weeks, will many people remember that clearly? Probably not. Yet Lindegaard’s errors against Reading remains fresh in the mind.\\nGiven the annual defensive injury curse has started early this year, and fans had already seen Carrick deployed as a centre back before the end of August, the confidence that comes with a settled goalkeeper would have been vital. Vidic, Ferdinand, Smalling, Jones, and Evans have already had spells on the sidelines, so the back four is uncertain at best. Much has been written of the damage done to United’s title hopes last season by a constantly changing rear guard which was unavoidable then and continues to be so, but voluntarily messing about with what should be a settled face behind them smacks of folly.\\nWhen United signed De Gea in 2011 for a fee of around £17m, Ferguson said: “We identified him quite a while back as one we should go for. He’s young, very quick, good composure, presence and an outstanding replacement for Van der Sar.”\\nThat’s a fantastic testimony, and a large fee suggests that he was prepared to put his money where his mouth was. And yet the slightest mistake and De Gea is relegated to a very expensive benchwarmer.\\nIn that quote, Ferguson acknowledges that De Gea is young. It’s escaped no one’s notice that he was only 20 years old at the time, and United bought potential on top of an impressive start to his career at Atletico Madrid.\\nHe’s a sensational shot stopper. Against Everton, what now looks like an unfortunate loss on paper could have been a much heavier beating without his intervention. Restored from the bench against Galatasaray, he made a late double save to keep a clean sheet and ensure the three points.\\nWhile it is fair to point out his command of his box, particularly on crosses, isn’t consistently good enough yet, that is something else that won’t improve from the bench. It also won’t improve through the occasional start in the Capital One Cup against Newcastle’s reserve strike force, until the late appearance of Cisse. Sir Alex says he wants to give both keepers experience of the Premier League, but De Gea’s experiences with added referee protection in Europe and in “lesser” cup competitions domestically just doesn’t provide the same learning curve.\\nWith Anders Lindegaard, you are supposedly blessed with a “safer” option. Perhaps an advantage in commanding the box, but what is safe about sacrificing world class saves? Not to mention inheriting dreadful distribution. With the Dane, it seems as if every ball has to go out to the centre backs, because his accuracy isn’t good enough to try any further. Against Tottenham, we saw perfectly how much pressure this puts the defence under when forwards press high up the pitch. De Gea can pick out a winger and start a counter attack. With Lindegaard, that poor distribution can give the opposition a chance to continue the pressure that United should have just alleviated by getting the ball back!\\nRealistically, I’d still be unhappy if Lindegaard was chosen as Ferguson’s first choice permanently, because I think De Gea is a better long term option. But if Sir Alex thinks the Dane is a better bet, then stick with him, and give him his chance to turn into the keeper that a great United side will need.\\nBe bold, make a decision and stand by it through the tough times. One squad will struggle to develop two young keepers to a world class standard. And United need one.',\n",

Chances are probably not as fast or as efficient as it could. To get a better understanding of the current state of technology training, we asked 300 enterprises about their biggest training challenges to date. We covered how much businesses spend on professional development, the most popular training solutions and what part training plays in the recruiting and retention process. You might want to read this soon—you know, before things change again.\\nHow much organizations spend on training now\\nMost companies are making a hefty invest in their tech staff—the average annual cost a company spends on each tech employee training’s comes in at a sizeable $2,400 per year.\\nNow, that may not sound like a lot, but when you times that number by the amount of employees that are eager to adopt the latest tech trends, you’ve got a costly price tag on your hands. But, justifiably so—you’ve got to keep your team up-to-date to stay competitive. Additionally, here’s what organizations are paying out to each employee (on average) to keep their skills sharp.\\nWhich kind of training businesses are using\\nIf you’re like most organizations, you’re using a mix of training options. You’ve given your team everything from classroom-based learning and conferences to books and tuition reimbursement.\\nHowever, the problem is, this isn’t always the training your staff wants. Or, more importantly, the training they actually need. Did you know the vast majority of your team wants tech-specific training? And guess what else? They want it fast.\\nTech teams spend a lot of time troubleshooting, so it only makes sense that they prefer training options that deliver immediate answers. While classrooms, conferences, books and peers might help enhance their skills, these sources don’t always help solve problems in a fast, efficient way. On-demand learning does.\\nThere’s a reason 88% of tech pros prefer online learning by a long shot. On-demand learning can help overcome some of the most common training challenges such as high cost, out of office time and inaccessibility. Furthermore, on-demand training solutions often provide managers with tools to track employee progress and actually measure results/ROI.\\nWhile not every organization or team will opt for the same training, something every manager can get behind is how crucial ongoing learning is to a team’s skill development and overall company success. But the truth is only 30% of organizations are satisfied with their current training solutions. Are you? It might be time to evaluate the state of your own technology training.\\nSee our full report on the state of technology training to get more in-depth, understand what part training plays in the recruiting and retention process and learn how to make training a competitive advantage for your team.\\nGet the report: 2016 state of technology training',\n",

The group included former Senate Majority Leader Dr. Bill Frist and Caroline Young, President of the Nashville Healthcare Council. The trip was sponsored by Kraft Healthcare Consulting in Nashville, Tennessee.\\nThe delegation toured the Latin American Medical University in Havana and other medical facilities that included a hospital, polyclinic, and an HIV clinic. The group had briefings from senior level healthcare leaders and government officials about the Cuban healthcare system. In addition, the delegation heard presentations from a Chief Economist regarding Cuban trade and the current U.S. Trade Embargo, and a psychologist that shared the increasing social inequality facing the socialistic government.\\nKoonce said of the trip, “Cuba has some impressive health-related metrics like low infant mortality rates and long life expectancies that rival or exceed most first world countries. It was a unique opportunity to see firsthand the challenges of their single payer, preventive medicine model. Our delegation had open and candid conversations with healthcare and government officials about the interworking of their healthcare system and the challenges they face. We also learned that many of their challenges are being exacerbated by an aging Cuban population, unhealthy lifestyles of its citizens and needs to repair or replace equipment and infrastructure within their delivery system.”\\nKoonce added, “I think many of us have a preconceived idea that the Cuban people are defined by their government. We found the Cuban people to be very hospitable and engaging. While they were eager to validate their successes, they also openly shared the limitations of a system burdened with providing free healthcare to its total population.”\\nFounded in 1993, HRG provides outsourcing solutions for self-pay and insurance receivables that improve cash flow, enhance customer service, and improve profitability for healthcare providers across the country.

Perhaps his knowledge is, for mere man, too sublime, too austere, too simplistic; but it is the knowledge of the ultimate, indisputable Truth of existence; and it is this very Truth which has the power to make us free.” Swami Abhayananda (translator of the original sanskrit text)\\nQ: How shall I reach the Self? Sri Ramana Maharshi: There is no reaching the Self. If Self were to be reached, it would mean that the Self is not here and now and that it is yet to be obtained. What is got afresh will also be lost. So it will be impermanent. What is not permanent is not worth striving for. So I say the Self is not reached. You are the Self, you are already that. The fact is, you are ignorant of your blissful state. Ignorance supervenes and draws a veil over the pure Self which is bliss. Attempts are directed only to remove this veil of ignorance which is merely wrong knowledge. The wrong knowledge is the false identification of the Self with the body and the mind. This false identification must go, and then the Self alone remains. Therefore realisation is for everyone; realisation makes no difference between the aspirants. This very doubt, whether you can realise, and the notion `I-have-not-realised’ are themselves the obstacles. Be free from these obstacles also. ~ From Be as you are book\\nLove everyone more Serve people in all you do Keep your mind on God – the highest good Offer homage to honourable beings Do good deeds: offer alms, feed the hungry and animals, help others Share in good will towards others, either in thought, message or person Work to support your Mother and Father Work to support those who need it – donate a portion of your earning Exert yourself each day It’s not what you do, it’s how you do it – do everything with a full heart of love Perform your day with right awareness\\nYou may try to satisfy your body with extravagant or overindulgent eating or sensualities, but it won’t fill you up.

Beautiful people do not just happen.” Elisabeth Kübler-Ross\\nVijñāna Bhairava Tantra (sometimes spelt Vigyan Bhairav Tantra) is a 5000 year old Sanskrit text of the Shaivism. The text is a chapter from the Rudrayamala Tantra, a Bhairava Agama. Cast as a discourse between the god Shiva and his consort Devi or Shakti. Devi, asks Shiva to reveal the essence of the way to realisation of the highest reality. In his answer Shiva describes 112 ways to enter into the universal and transcendental state of consciousness. These include several variants of breath awareness, concentration on various centres in the body, non-dual awareness, chanting, imagination and visualisation and contemplation through each of the senses. Devi (Ma Parvati, Lord Shiva’s consort) asks: O Shiva, what is your reality? What is the wonder-filled universe? What constitutes seed? Who centres the universal wheel? What is the life beyond form pervading forms? How may we enter it fully, above space and time, names and descriptions? Let my doubts be cleared! And Lord Shiva replies by way of 112 sutras, each one describing a particular meditation techniques to find the ultimate reality. There are nine ways concerning breath: “1. Lo, Radiant one, this experience may dawn between two breaths, After breath comes in (down) and just before turning up (out) the beneficence.” “2. As a breath turns from down to up, and again as breath curves from up to down through both these turns, realise.” “3. Or, whenever in breath and out breath fuse, at this instant touch the energy-less energy-filled centre.” “4. Or when breath is all out (up) and stopped in such universal pause, ones small self vanishes. This is difficult only for the impure.” “8. Attention between eyebrows, let mind be before thought.

Otherwise he is of the same form as the thought-streams. 1.5. The thought-streams are five-fold, painful and not painful. 1.6. Right knowledge, wrong knowledge, fancy, sleep and memory. 1.7. Right knowledge is inference, tradition and genuine cognition. 1.8. Wrong knowledge is false, illusory, erroneous beliefs or notions. 1.9. Fancy is following after word-knowledge empty of substance. 1.10. Deep sleep is the modification of the mind which has for its substratum nothingness. 1.11. Memory is not allowing mental impressions to escape. 1.12. These thought-streams are controlled by practice and non-attachment. 1.13. Practice is the effort to secure steadiness. 1.14. This practice becomes well-grounded when continued with reverent devotion and without interruption over a long period of time. 1.15.

       " {'text': 'How to Setup a Successful Photography Business\\nYou love taking pictures. You’ve got a DSLR camera with some great lenses. Everyone says you’re talented, and you have done some freelance photography work. Now, you are ready to take the next step and start your own photography business.\\nAs you transition into your new business, you will need to get more equipment and even more experience. This does not just include photography but also learning about marketing and customer relationship management, setting up business operations and taking more photos than you ever have before.\\nHere are a few steps to take before opening your business.\\nCreate and Business Plan\\nThe old adage, “if you don’t know where you’re going, any road will get you there“, applies to starting a business as much as to any other kind of goal setting situation. Draft business goals that define what kind of photography you want to do, who your ideal customers are, what kind of revenue expectations you have and what kind of schedule you want. Use realistic estimates for expenses, peak and down business times and how much time you’d need for management tasks like record keeping, marketing and strategic planning.\\nWith business goals drafted, write a business plan that includes your top business objectives, a mission statement, success factors, financials including assets and startup expenses, service definitions, market analysis, operations plans and profit and loss projections. The Small Business Administration has great references for writing business plans, or you can work with a business coach, lawyer or accountant to prepare your plan.\\nBuild Your Portfolio\\nEvery photographer needs to show their work to showcase their talents and attract clients. A photography portfolio represents your current and best work, and should include the type of photos you want to shoot. For example, if you want to specialize in baby photography, your portfolio needs to be mostly baby portraits.\\nA good, representative portfolio also is important in developing your marketing strategy including your business website and social media pages. This is where you’ll reach customers, and display your body of work.\\nSet Up Operations\\nOnce you have laid the ground work, it’s time to set up business operations. Register your business name, develop a logo, set up a website and social media presence, open a business bank account, get business insurance, find an accountant or a bookkeeping software program, create business cards and start advertising.\\nThe SBA advises that you should determine the legal structure for your business such as sole proprietorship, partnership, limited liability company, corporation or S corporation. You may want to take advantage of the SBA’s free business training and counselling services.\\nAs a new photography business owner, you also may want to purchase extra protection for your photos and other important documents through a cloud storage provider. Top 10 Cloud Storage is a great reference because it provides reviews and comparisons of cloud companies, such as Just Cloud, so that you can find the service with the right amount of space with the right price. You can store and manage your startup documents such as contracts, finance documents and marketing plans as well as backup your photo files.',\n",

There just aren't much third-party applications readily available for it, as well as the third-party watchfaces, though numerous, aren't great. If you use the Galaxy See with a phone that's not made by Samsung, you'll additionally need to set up countless apps on your phone to allow all of its functions, which is annoying.But in addition to Garmin Forerunner 245 Reddit .\\nthose issues, the Galaxy Watch has to do with like it gets for Android users.For years Samsung's Gear collection of smartwatches have been controling the market for all the best reasons. When you take clever advertising and marketing and also incredible items in order to integrate them together, this is what happens. The Equipment S3 is certainly among my preferred smartwatches.Right out of package, you can tell that the S3 is a top smartwatch;\\nlaunched previously this year, the S3 concentrates on whatever that was right in the previous versions, as well as adds much more functions than previously. Sure, I understand it sets you back relatively higher than some of the other alternatives on the list, however it is okay.Starting off, the construct top quality is extremely pleasing, with superior top quality materials used throughout the construction. The watch absolutely feels like a style declaration as long as it really feels like a costs smartwatch.Unlike several of the other smartwatches in the marketplace, the Gear S3 does not operate on Android Put on, instead, it runs on Samsung's own OS called Tizen. Before my evaluation, I had my doubts about this OS as it is still something brand-new, and also unidentified to me.Luckily, upon making use of the look for a week, I can state that the OS is encouraging, however, the severe absence of applications may keep some users at bay. Samsung recently pushed Garmin Forerunner 245 Reddit\\nan upgraded to this watch, permitting you to save offline Spotify playlists onto the 4GB of storage.This function makes my life easy since I no more have to rely upon my data link to listen to the music whenever I am outdoors. The Gear S3 has a computer animated always-on screen, and unlike some of the various other watches I utilize on a standard basis, this is one stunning display screen, thanks to Samsung.Another wonderful point that I like concerning the Equipment S3 is the reality that it comes packed with activity trackers of all sorts, as well as while a number of people could feel cynical regarding it, especially when you think of the quantity of approvals it requires. It actually is not that big of an issue to be honest.The Equipment S3 additionally supplies a great, instinctive interface that is amongst the very best I have seen in any kind of smartwatch.\\nAll of these excellent attributes combine and make this a top smartwatch. I do have some problems that are essential to be checklist out.For starters, the watch looks large on your wrist; currently that is something that totally depends on exactly how your wrists are. This is a subjective problem of course, however I still believe it is necessary to point it out. Another point that was a frustration was the sheer lack of proper apps. Garmin Forerunner 245 Reddit\\nThat is mainly as a result of the reality that Tizen is still a smartwatch OS that is creating, as well as becoming better. If you are all right with these minor hassles, then I can inform you that the Samsung Equipment S3 is certainly one of the most effective smartwatches 2017. Developer smartwatches are catching on, however most of choices around most likely come from Fossil Team's ranks-- as well as\\none of the finest amongst them is the excellent Skagen Falster 2. It's a unisex watch that can be found in a unisex size, although it's undoubtedly among the much more manly finishes in the Fossil Group line-up. Light and also slim, the Skagen obstacles those that whine that smartwatches are too beefy, loading a full 1.19-inch OLED touchscreen. In terms of dimension, the instance has been reduced to 40mm, which as little as any kind of smartwatch around-- as well as it's exceptionally light also. At 0.8 mm thick it's no Daniel Wellington, yet it's as comfy as any full-screen Wear OS enjoy out there.\\nIt takes a standard 20mm band, so you can basically pick anything from the analogue watch world to pander out your smartwatch.There are disadvantages for a tech point of view. It used older Qualcomm technology so battery life is stuck around a single day's usage and we did see some efficiency concerns.

When you're not sweating it out, it'll sit there looking beautiful.The majority of smartwatches in our list have been full-screen devices, however\\nthe Withings Steel HR comes close to things a little in different ways-- yet is still a powerful linked watch in a package that considers simply 49g. The analogue display screen reveals the moment on the major dial (with a month of battery life )as well as progression in the direction of your step goal on the second dial-- yet there's a lot a lot more taking place than this.The Withings Steel Human Resources has a 24/7 heart price screen that will maintain tabs on VO2 Max and also it will pair up with a smart device to track outside workouts via GPS, although the tech isn't constructed right into the watch itself.

They have fewer attributes, worse battery life, as well as commonly thick, clumsy styles. Based upon our experience, the Wear OS watches that make out the very best are ones made by Fossil as well as its stable of brand names (such as Skagen), which are available in a range of styles as well as sizes.It's adept as a linked watch either, and will certainly inform you to notices on your smart device making use of vibrations as well as the small OLED screen build into the bezel.\\nThis is qualified of offering fast as well as relatively unrefined informs, but\\ncan show you when a message/call/calendar informs are coming through using quick icons.It's a removed back smartwatch experience yet one that's packed into a fashionable, small as well as comfy hybrid that doesn't make as numerous compromises as you would certainly think.Huawei is still choosing its Watch 2, however in 2018 came back to the table\\nwith something completely different. The Huawei Watch GT packs a huge set of features yet in addition to a customized os-- those are words we generally utter with a massive amount of nervousness, however the Watch GT supplies 2 weeks of battery life, which is an engaging sell.And it does not scrimp on technology. Huawei has crammed in a 1.39-inch, 454 x 454 AMOLED display.

Lite OS might take away several of the much deeper elements previously located in Huawei smartwatches, it's still an impressive task tracker with heart price surveillance and also rest tracking.Sports tracking on the general\\nis good, but there is one complaint we do have: data can not be shared with third-party applications. Every one of your data can just live within Huawei's companion Health app. We likewise found the heart price information to delay method behind achieved sports tracking rivals.Huawei makes big guarantees in the battery division: as much as two weeks with regular use, a total day of GPS tracking and also up to a month with attributes like always-on display as well as GPS shut off. And also it delivers. Even with constant heart rate surveillance activated, we've only needed to bill the Watch GT once throughout our three weeks of use.There's now new Huawei Watch GT Active as well as Elegant versions that supplies a less flashy look however features all of the same features including a new Triathlon tracking setting. For those seeking Pebble-esque durability, but want to forgo the glitz and appeal of a totally created os and all the applications and prestige-- the Huawei Watch GT is a fascinating selection.

It has a circular face that's simple to review inside and out, and also has an extremely beneficial always-on setting that makes it simple to see the time at a glance.We're roughly 4 years right into the Great Modern Smartwatch Experiment, which implies we've learned what smartwatches can be great for\\n(fitness tracking, notices )and also what they are definitely bad for(changing your smart device completely).

For that factor, we do not believe LTE smartwatches are an excellent buy for lots of people-- it's far easier and cheaper to simply keep your phone with you and use your watch as a kind of push-button control for the phone in your pocket or bag.Which smartwatch you choose is mosting likely to be based entirely on what phone you possess, so our choices are broken down into the best option for iPhone individuals as well as the very best one for Android owners.The Apple Watch Series 4 is as near smartwatch excellence as we have actually attended day-- it's a powerful and functional wearable that can offer a huge array of features. While those trying to find a basic smartwatch might discover the Collection 4's massive array of health and fitness, health as well as connected functions to be overkill, it has the ability to change in between health and fitness tracker, sports view as well as serious health and wellness gadget at will, making it a serious group pleaser.Apple's newest Watch enhancement provides us one of the most significant style change because the original, bringing new 40mm and 44mm sizes (in comparison to 38mm and 42mm). That indicates even more area to flaunt all the most up to date software application attributes introduced in watchOS 5. It has all the same core fitness and also sporting activities tracking as the Collection 3, consisting of integrated GENERAL PRACTITIONERS\\nfor monitoring of exterior exercises and also a swimproof style. Health and fitness monitoring evaluation might delay Fitbit, however Apple's one-of-a-kind objectives-- represented by the closing of Move, Stand and Calorie rings-- is still a powerful incentive. Nevertheless, there's still no indigenous rest tracking\\nbelow, however this can be done by means of a 3rd party app.The headline functions are the new ECG display that unlocks the ability for serious heart health and wellness monitoring. It's been FDA removed, so the feature can be utilized to find heart rhythm irregularities. It's currently offered beyond the US with Apple including 19 even more nations that can check in on their heart health and wellness from the new Watch. You also do not need to do that by hand, as well as the Apple Watch continuously keeps track of for low\\nand elevated heart prices, as well as AFib. There's likewise a brand-new autumn detection setting that can allow individuals gain access to Siri to get in touch with emergency situation solutions or an emergency contact.If you are trying to find an excellent smartwatch that does not set you back a great deal of money, the S928 Sports Watch may be a terrific choice. It is just one of the least expensive smartwatch on my listing, as well as while I am usually adamant when it comes to evaluating such items, it intrigued me to the core.The watch is developed rather simply, as well as rather of having an expensive screen or high resolution, it uses a simple, single display screen. Honestly, I do incline that in any way, smartwatches are all concerning being simplistic in my viewpoint, and the S928 Sports Watch does a terrific job at that.Where it does not have a display screen, the S928 Sports Watch makes up by offering some of the very best attributes that you can want in a smartwatch. In order to make things simpler for the visitor, I am note down the attributes below.Heart Price Screen: The watch features a heart price display that has the ability to offer actual time heart rate updates.GPS: The S928 Sports Watch likewise come with an integrated in 3D accelerometer +gyroscope3D, allowing the customers to be able to track every step they make throughout their workout regime.Outdoor Information: The watch is also with the ability of keeping a record of the outside data, indicating that you obtain real time updates on how the climate condition is outside. Permitting you to be able to prepare your exercise carefully.These are several of the sophisticated or standard features that remain in the watch. While they may not look sufficient, it is vital to know that these attributes function throughout the whole environment of the\\nwatch, allowing these sensing units to take full control of the situation.The smartwatch can be controlled with an app that is offered on both iphone as well as Android. Truthfully, the app is as fundamental as it can obtain, and can utilize a little bit\\nextra polish. There are a few more points that I did not recognize concerning the watch; you can not transform the time layout to 12 hours if you want to.In enhancement to that, the watch itself only sustains English as a language, while the application itself has 12 languages in total amount. This incongruity can be a concern for individuals that don't have English as their main language, as well as despite the fact that 12 languages are good to have, they are simply enough.The advantage here is that the app is being continuously upgraded by the designer, so I can presume that additional\\nlanguages will be included sometime in the future. Same goes for the watch as the firmware can be updated when released.All in all, the S928 is a decent smartwatch for Android, it is economical, works as it is supposed to, as well as does not come with unneeded attributes that can drain pipes the battery. I would say that this smartwatch features the bare fundamentals, and also absolutely has a market among the giants.Sure, the lack of sophisticated functions, as well as languages is disconcerting, yet you likewise need to take price right into consideration when you are assessing a product.Although smartwatches have existed for a long, long time, their venture right into the mainstream is just current. With firms like Samsung, Apple, Asus, Huawei, as well as several others are working day and evening to enhance the watches, and also genuinely make the experience a lot better.Amidst all this, there lies the consumer frame of mind that still thinks that the standard, analog watches are method, means much better as they are crafted with fantastic accuracy, along with perfection. This has actually resulted in numerous arguments how smartwatches shouldn't exist, or are taken into consideration scourge of the wrist watch concept.Still, for individuals that really choose their watches present all the needed details that comes\\nto their phone, all connected right into one environment really think about smartwatches to be really beneficial, and also adhering to that into the market, the smartwatch industry at this moment is creating a different entity for itself.The Collection 4 comes packing LTE once again so you can take it out sans iPhone as well as still make/receive calls, get texts and all other alerts you would on your phone. A new speaker likewise makes Siri talks as well as call sound louder and also clearer.Battery life is\\nthe primary gripe still, as well as for all the improvements, Apple can still just use 24-48 hours-- which for numerous simply isn't great enough.The Fitbit Versa is the firm's 2nd smartwatch and, along with a modification in layout instructions, it's most importantly readily available at a much more budget-friendly price than the Apple Watch-- it can commonly be picked up for around$179.99. And don't fail to remember-Fitbit has actually revealed the Versa Lite Edition(much more on that particular listed below)which appear at $159. The Fitbit Versa can be found in a host of different surfaces and with a large collection of bands to blend the appearance. As well as many thanks to the runaway success of the smartwatch, there's a bustling market of bands to pick from.The Versa provides all of the same physical fitness as well as sports tracking includes you 'd anticipate from the Fitbit ecosystem, though the large omission right here is the lack of GPS. If you want to track runs and also trips, you'll need to take your smart device with you, as well as the watch can piggyback your phone's information.\\nFor numerous this won't be a massive problem, however as severe joggers it's a level of difficulty we such as to avoid.Fitbit OS 2.0 brings a new-look UI that offers much more insights right into your everyday information and also quick reply support for Android phone customers(iphone assistance coming with a later date). You can still download and install apps as well as an entire great deal of watch faces, pay from your wrist using Fitbit Pay, and also tap into Fitbit Coach. Meanwhile the new women's health and wellness monitoring has additionally been presented for the very first time, which is also available for the\\nIonic, too.But it's battery life that really has the power to compel purchasers, along with the eye-catching rate. You can obtain 5 days on a single fee, which means much less inconvenience on weekends away, and also simpler sleep tracking.Fitbit had such great success with the first\\nVersa that it determined to make a more affordable variation that removes out several of the smartwatch features.The Lite is practically similar to the first Versa in looks, conserve for currently simply a single physical switch on the watch body, which suggests you'll be relying a lot more on the touchscreen display screen to navigate the Versa Lite. In our experience, we didn't miss the 2nd switch too much.In regards to the feature that are shed, you don't obtain an integrated music gamer or swim tracking (it's still water resistant though). You do get an optical heart rate display and all the common health and fitness monitoring as well as sporting activities tracking functions in addition to app-based functions like females's health and wellness tracking. There's also no much longer Wi-Fi, with Fitbit presenting a new and also less complicated method to upgrade your smartwatch via incremental history downloads.Sports as well as fitness tracking efficiency is not that different from what we located on the first Versa.\\nRest tracking is still a standout function, while the heart price monitor still has a tendency to falter for high strength exercises. As a core smartwatch experience it's decent, yet it still lacks in comparison to its closest rivals.\\nParticularly in the app division. If you enjoy watch encounters though, you're well offered here.Thankfully you still obtain the very same four-day plus battery life, which can certainly extend to five days relying on use. That's still much better than what Apple and also Google's Wear OS watches can muster up best now.If you suched as the Versa, however prefer to spend a little less, the Versa Lite Version is fitting option. The swim monitoring is a disappointing noninclusion extra so than the songs player, however if you can live without checking your swimming pool sessions it's still an excellent smartwatch to think about at a great price.The Samsung Galaxy Watch is the follower to the Gear S3 as well as is still among the very best watches around.

It's currently water-proof also, including swim tracking abilities that are on par with the Watch Series 4. The Galaxy Watch runs on Samsung's Tizen OS 4.0 and also seems like a far better option to Google's Wear OS today. You still obtain that rotating bezel and also one of the best displays you can discover on a smartwatch. The app selection\\nstill delays method behind the Apple Watch as well as Put on OS devices. That said, the Spotify application is fantastic and also provides offline playback.Battery life, we need to state, is additionally strong, getting you 2-3 days on the 42mm version as well as even more on the 46mm variation.\\nIf you're not a follower of Wear OS as well as do not desire an Apple Watch, this is the top alternative to take into consideration instead.Garmin has been producing best smartwatches for sporting activities lovers for a while now.

Heart rate monitoring is good otherwise class-leading, and also it will not maintain you lingering for a GPS signal. There's likewise all the anxiety tracking rewards from Garmin's health and fitness trackers.

It's still something you require to charge rather consistently, however you do not need to fret concerning it dying on your wrist midway with the day if you have actually started with a complete tank.Unlike basically every other smartwatch on the marketplace, the Apple Watch still does not offer an always-on display screen, nonetheless, so it does not in fact tell you the time until you touch the screen or lift your wrist.

       " {'text': 'On Monday, May 20th, President of Ukraine Volodymyr Zelensky addressed the Ukrainian people during his inauguration at the Verkhovna Rada.\\nPresent at the inauguration of the head of the Ukrainian State were a number of foreign presidents, many high-ranked guests and diplomats, the previous presidents of Ukraine, members of the Ukrainian Government, people’s deputies and Ukrainian celebrities.\\nIn his speech, Zelensky in part said that “it is our common victory and our common chance”. He also added that the entire nation has to take responsibility for the country.\\n“And just now not only I have sworn, but each of us has also put their hand onto the Constitution and sworn allegiance to Ukraine”, stressed the President.\\nVolodymyr Zelensky said addressing those present at the ceremony that Europe begins with every one of us and “it is not somewhere else but right here”. The President referred to the European Union as a dream shared by all the Ukrainian people. He called upon government officials not to hang his portraits in their offices because “the president is not an icon or an idol. He is not a picture either”.\\nThe new head of the State addressed Ukrainians living outside Ukraine. “You should come to Ukraine not as guests but to come home. We are waiting for you. Do not bring souvenirs, bring your knowledge and mental values”, stressed Zelensky. He added that Ukraine needs migrant workers. He called upon them to come back home.\\nThe President believes that the national idea means to start a new epoch and “by joint efforts to do impossible”.\\n“Each of us has perished in Donbas. Every day we lose one of us”, said the President.\\nIn his inauguration speech Volodymyr Zelensky emphasized that the major task of Ukraine is to stop the war in Donbas.\\n“I am ready to do everything in my power to prevent our heroes from being killed. We did not start this war but we must end it, – the President went on to say. – And we are ready for a dialog”. Zelensky expressed his strong conviction that the release of Ukrainian prisoners by Russia should be the first step to such a dialog.\\nIn his speech Volodymyr Zelensky stressed that Ukraine has lost not only part of her territories but also the people living there and “we have to return them”.\\nThe President offered the current Government to resign. “Our Government lifts their arms helplessly and tells me that they can do nothing. It is not true – you can. You can take a piece of paper and a pen and vacate your offices for those who will take care of the coming generations rather than think about the coming elections”.\\nBesides, Volodymyr Zelensky demanded for the Defense Minister of Ukraine, the Prosecutor-General and the Head of the Security Service of Ukraine to step down. The President also plans to disband the Verkhovna Rada of the eighth convocation. He set three priority tasks for the lawmakers to carry out in the two coming months. Thus they have to pass legislations on removing deputy immunity, on elections according to party lists and on bringing to justice for illegal enrichment.\\nIn concluding his speech Volodymyr Zelensky said that all his life he had been trying to do everything to make Ukrainians smile. “The next five years I’ll do everything possible so that Ukrainians won’t cry”.\\nVerkhovna Rada Head Andriy Parubiy ended the inauguration of the new President of Ukraine with a comment. “It’s been fun”, said the Speaker in jest closing the session of the Parliament.\\nThe Government expects to work for another five years. Will it manage this?\\nAfter the presidential election was over, Ukrainian Prime Minister Volodymyr Groisman who has been at the head of the Cabinet for the past three years, repeated over and over again that his Cabinet would continue reforms until a new Parliament has been elected. Because if the country will stop in its development and wait for a new coalition to be formed, everything that has been achieved so far will be lost.\\nAfter Verkhovna Rada Chairman Andriy Parubiy announced on May 17th that the parliament coalition “European Ukraine” had discontinued its existence, the Premier voiced his conviction once again that the Verkhovna Rada would be working and making important decisions. “We still have chances. So either we’ll use them in order to strengthen Ukraine or we are going to have another stage of lost opportunities. Let’s change the country in five months’ time”, Volodymyr Groisman urged the deputies.\\nNow President Zelensky does not think so. During his inauguration speech he declared the Parliament to have been disbanded and called the Government to resign. The Foreign Minister and the Defense Minister which are appointed by the Verkhovna Rada after their candidacies are offered by the President, have already submitted their letters of resignation.\\nIn the meantime, the key problem of payments on the foreign debt which will claim a third of the State Budget still remains. Premier Groisman has repeatedly stressed that his Cabinet has succeeded in the past three years to reduce a part of the foreign debt from 80% to 59% of the gross domestic product. This means that for the first time in many years Ukraine has reached the Maastricht criteria for the EU member states and countries-applicants for EU membership. In keeping with these standards, the State debt of a country does not have to exceed 60% of its gross domestic product.\\nAccording to the statistical data provided by the National Bank of Ukraine, the consumer inflation in the first quarter of 2019 slowed down to 8.6% this March compared with 9.8% last December. At the same time, the National Bank of Ukraine has predicted a drop in the consumer inflation to 6.3% by the end of this year. Of course, the NBU’s prognosis does not take into account possible political instability in the country caused by decisions of the new President and the upcoming parliamentary elections.\\nLast week the Ukrainian Government approved a resolution that widens the list of Russian-made products that are banned to import to the territory of Ukraine. The resolution was passed as a part of the policy of sanctions against the country-aggressor. “The resolution has been drafted and approved on the request of our enterprises and business associates in response to discriminatory or unfriendly actions of the Russian Federation aimed to close the Russian market for Ukrainian products and to limit the transit of goods from Ukraine through the territory of the Russian Federation”, informed the First Vice-Premier Stepan Kubiv.\\nBy its decision that takes effect August 1 of this year, the Government has introduced special custom dues on the import of all goods from the Russian Federation with the exception of the import of such sensitive products as coal, coke, gasoline, liquefied gas and pharmaceuticals.\\nParliament activities were the subject of close scrutiny\\nSince the beginning of this month the Verkhovna Rada has been in session only for a week. However, during this week the work of the Parliament was the subject of special attention of the public. On Monday, May 20th President-elect Volodymyr Zelensky took the oath of office at the Verkhovna Rada. A few days before that, seven proposals on different inauguration dates were submitted to the Parliament. The final decision on this question was made on Thursday, May 16th.\\nHowever, heated debates started right from the beginning of last week. On Tuesday, May 14th lawmakers considered and repealed four draft resolutions to cancel voting on the law to ensure the functioning of Ukrainian as the State language. In such a way parliamentarians made it possible for the law to pass the Parliament. Speaker Parubiy signed the bill right on the parliamentary rostrum. Incumbent President Poroshenko signed the bill into law without delay. On Thursday, May 16th the historic law was officially published in the press.\\nAt the same time the Verkhovna Rada worked hard on a number of bills dealing with fuel and energy issues. Of a whole string of bills, two draft laws were about integration of Ukraine into European market. It was envisaged to introduce some changes into an energy market bill. In the course of debates on this issue parliamentarians expressed quite a few critical remarks and suggestions. The session made two attempts to pass the bill but failed.\\nThe Verkhovna Rada supported proposals to conduct parliamentary hearings on the theme “Problems and prospects for protecting cultural heritage in Ukraine”. The Parliament was short on votes to support changes to some legislations aimed at improving social protection of children and families with children. No agreement was reached on conducting parliamentary hearings featuring State nature conservation measures.\\nOn Wednesday, May 15th the Parliament launched the second reading of the bill on introducing improvements and changes into the legislations dealing with activities of the State Agency for Investigations. On Thursday morning the package of the changes was approved and passed as a law.\\nPassions were running high last Friday too. At the morning session the leader of the faction “People’s Front” declared that his faction was leaving the coalition. Following this decision of the faction, Verkhovna Rada Chairman Andriy Parubiy made a statement that the parliamentary coalition “European Ukraine” ceased to exist on May 17th of this year at the Verkhovna Rada of the eighth convocation.\\nConsequently, the future destiny of this Parliament became unclear. And later during his inauguration speech President Zelensky declared that he was disbanding the current Verkhovna Rada.\\nPhoto by Olexandr KLYMENKO.',\n",

It doesn’t matter what size you are, it matters how big you are compared to the person next to you. If you are 4′ 8″ and 79 lbs, you pick someone who’s at least 5′ 2″ and you’re good. If you’re 6′ 3″ and 330 lbs, go for the 6’5″, 440 pounder. If you aren’t sure if your choice meets the criteria for being enough bigger than you, refer to the spousal proportionality index (I’m sure it can be found on Google).\\n2) Pick someone who looks like they could be related to you. Just because it seems to work out well, usually. Bonus: This same rule applies to picking out pets! Ignore this rule if you hate your family. Then pick someone with exactly opposite features. You have big, round eyes? Pick someone squinty. You have darker skin? Pick someone who burns after 4.3 seconds of Sun exposure. Hate communicating with your mother? Pick an English language learner. You get the idea.\\n3) The hairier the better. Even if you are a hairy brute, if you pick someone with 342 hairs per square inch more than you have, you’ll look delicate in comparison. You will, however, have to invest in laser hair removal for your children, in lieu of a college fund.\\n4) You need one nag. There has to be one person who cares passionately about the lights being turned off, the counter tops being cleared, and the organization of the shoe rack. Passionately! If we do not all pair up to ensure this 1-1 nag ratio, the Earth would implode while simultaneously being taken over by an evil cat dictator. At least, that’s the general idea I’m getting, based on Mr. Grouch’s feelings towards lights, counter tops and shoe racks.\\n5) Pick a boozer who isn’t too much of a boozer. You don’t want someone who doesn’t like to drink. That’s boring. But, you also don’t want someone who’s going to ruin the office Christmas party by signing photocopies of their ass and stuffing them in the decorative stockings on the walls, either. Helpful Hint: If you can find someone who truly drinks socially, as in 1-2 drinks max, then you’ll always have a designated driver.\\n6) Pick someone who will let you complain. You need someone to vent to about your stupid job, to side with you when you get pissed off at your stupid cousin, and someone to lean on when your stupid dog dies.\\n7) Pick someone who will tell you to shut up. You don’t want to become some bitter, self-righteous harpy. Even when your cousin is an asshole, or your cat chokes on a hairball (his, yours, or your mate’s) and bites the dust. You need a kick in the pants every once in a while to regain some grace and put things in perspective.\\n8) Make sure you can put up with their most annoying habits. Because they aren’t going to go away. The snoring and the loud chewing and the good morning farts will actually increase in intensity 20-fold. At least. Learn to deal, or get out now, before your ear drums burst from the sound of Honey Nut Cheerios being munched, or you’re suffocated by cockcrow fumes.\\n9) Pick someone whose family members you don’t want to punch in the mouth. I mean, sometimes you will want to give a quick little sucker punch. Pow. But, to be fair, you also want to give a little tap to members of your own family from time to time. In some ways your in-laws will never really understand you, but in other ways you will be closer to them than your own blood. Even though they are not yours by ancestry, they are now yours by proximity. Don’t foolishly think they will go away – relatives love to stick nearby one another and drive each other batshit crazy, until the day they die.\\n10) Pick someone who gives you your space. In the honeymoon stage all you want to do is cuddle and kiss and pet each other. Once you’re over that sweet little hump you’re still going to enjoy spending quality time together, but you’ll no longer be willing to give up your weekly coffee dates with your friends, book club meetings (aka wine drinking and laugh-fests) and you are absolutely not going to want his foot to touch yours when you’re sleeping. Trust me. I have never understood how a King sized bed is the largest bed they make. There is so not enough space for two people who have been together for more than one year.\\nAny other tips for long-term couplings?',\n",

       " {'text': 'Idea Crib’s Well-thy Pinoy Profiles blog series is now underway!! With this blog series, I plan to regularly feature healthy and happy Pinoys and glean insights about why and how they keep healthy and happy. The ultimate aim is to inspire more individuals to take care of themselves by taking care of their health and their bodies.\\nThe first featured personality in this blog series is my friend Carlo, a marathoner and Certified Investment Solicitor. He also just finished his first triathlon last week. Check out his answers in the blog’s latest post.\\nWell-thy Pinoy Profiles: Get to Know Carlo Sicat\\nOccupation Senior Financial Adviser & Certified Investment Solicitor\\nHobbies Triathlon, Ultimate Frisbee, and Backpack Traveling\\nSocial media profile IG: @carlokohan\\nHow do you stay healthy?\\nI stay healthy by making sure I do physical activities daily or every other day. I also make sure that I eat right and in moderation.\\nWhy do you keep healthy?\\nIt feels good to be healthy. It boosts your confidence and it also gives you benefits like not being sick and being able to function well in your job.\\nWhen did you decide to live healthy?\\nI used to work in the BPO Industry. As we all know, the nature of BPO work is kind of exhausting due to shifting schedules; I gained a lot of weight while working in a BPO company.\\nI used to be a fan of fast food. I loved eating in buffet and indulging in sweets. I thought that as long as I was earning good, I can eat whatever I want. Until I frequently got sick. I remember getting hospitalized 3x a year due to gastritis. I was obese by then. I thought I was healthy because I looked healthy but I wasn’t. That was when I decided to lose weight.\\nI tried running thinking that was the fastest way to lose weight. It proved effective for me. I learned to love it and it eventually became part of my routine.\\nWhat are your favorite indulgences/ cheat day treats?\\nIce cream. I can finish a 1.5 gallon in one seating. My favorite flavor is cookies and cream. Buffets. I still can’t resist them. Tenka at Glorietta 4 is my favorite so far.\\nIn your opinion, what’s the one thing people can do to kick-start their journey to wellness?\\nDid you know that eating healthy, doing physical activities, and not smoking are the 3 easy behaviors we can do to not get sick? According to studies, if we take these for granted, these may lead to the top 4 chronic diseases like cardiovascular disease, cancer, diabetes, and lung diseases which contribute to 50% of deaths world wide. You don’t have to be an athlete or a gym rat. Just make sure you stay active, eat healthy, and quit smoking (if you’re a smoker, that is) because the only person who will take care of the sick person you will be is the healthy you now.\\nI love that last line. Soo true. I also agree that you don’t have to be an athlete to be healthy! What can you say about Carlo’s journey to fitness and wellness? Who else can I feature in this series? I’d love to hear your comments below.\\nThe next Well-thy Pinoy Profile is on March 30, 2016. Can you guess who I’ll feature? 🙂 Stay tuned!\\nJoin the mailing list:\\nLike it?

       " {'text': 'It has been two years since Microsoft launched Games With Gold; their Xbox counterpart to Sony’s PlayStation Plus program that lets users with a premium membership receive free games every month.\\nTo celebrate this anniversary, Microsoft is giving away four games to Gold members; two for Xbox One and two for Xbox 360.\\nXbox One owners can look forward to receiving Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag and So Many Me. Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag will be available for the entirety of July and So Many Me will be available from July 16.\\nWhilst Xbox 360 users will be able to get a hold of Plants vs. Zombies and Gears of War 3. The releases will be staggered, with Plants vs. Zombies available from July 1, and Gears Of War 3 available from July 16.\\nAlthough Games With Gold has been running for two years, the service has only included Xbox One games since last June. So in addition to the bumper pack of free games available this month, Microsoft has also announced that from now on they will offer two free Xbox One games every month rather than just one.\\nAssassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag is arguably the highlight of this months offering. The game is set during the golden age of piracy and is most loved for its vast open world and the depth of the naval combat. And even though it is two years old it is still considered one of the best games in the Assassin’s Creed series. I imagine being able to role play as a pirate AND an assassin in the same game had a much wider appeal than expected.\\nThere hasn’t been any word on what future Games With Gold offerings will contain, but judging from past releases, they will likely be a majority of independent and smaller games mixed with a sprinkling of triple-A titles. But considering these games are free, I doubt anyone is going to complain.\\nDanny is a former games producer turned writer and video maker. He’s been gaming since he was 3 years old (albeit terribly) and can be found on Twitter usually whining about minor inconveniences.',\n",

       " {'text': \"Amortization is a financial practice that allows buyers to pay for something over an extended schedule rather than all at once. Mortgages and car loans, for example, are commonly paid through an amortization schedule.\\nAn amortization schedule typically involves regular payments over a particular time period. Essentially an extension of credit, amortization allows people and businesses to make purchases that they don't have funds available to pay in full. Because interest is factored into payments, the total cost of an amortized purchase is significantly higher than the original price.\\nIn business, amortization is usually separated into amortization of assets and amortization of loans because those categories are handled differently. Amortization is often the most cost-effective method of allocating funds for a given expense, even if the funds are available for immediate payment, because there may be a more profitable use of those funds. Similarly, a business may take out a loan rather than paying for something outright because there is a financial advantage, such as optimizing a tax deduction over an extended period.\\nAmortization originates from the Latin admortire meaning to kill.\",\n",

       " {'text': 'The National Retail Federation spent weeks urging the White House to include in the president’s State of the Union address a plug for retail jobs along with domestic manufacturing ones.\\nApparently, the president didn’t buy it.\\n“A lot of his speech was focused on the notion of bringing manufacturing jobs back to the United States,” said the retail group’s top lobbyist, David French. “Well, retailers haven’t left.”\\nLobbyists obviously don’t get to write the State of the Union. But the White House did solicit advice from its liberal-leaning outside allies and heard plenty from industry groups such as the NRF. Though some groups were pleased to hear President Barack Obama give their priorities a boost and quickly dispatched press releases cheering him, others are now downplaying the address’s significance at all.\\n“It’s just one speech,” French said. “It’s a theme-setter and really not much more.”\\nWhile Obama may not have had much to say on the retail-jobs theme, he did include many mentions of education policy — not all of them welcomed by school lobbyists.\\n“So let me put colleges and universities on notice: If you can’t stop tuition from going up, the funding you get from taxpayers will go down,” Obama said in his Tuesday night address. “Higher education can’t be a luxury — it’s an economic imperative that every family in America should be able to afford.”\\nThe Association of American Universities’ Barry Toiv said his organization’s members are working on tuition costs but that it is particularly difficult for public universities whose states are in financial peril and are cutting funding.\\n“We’re certainly curious as to what [the president] is going to propose on Friday,” Toiv said. “There have been proposals in past years that would have harmed students by taking away their aid.”\\nOn the other hand, Toiv said that the AAU’s members were happy Obama included a pitch for continued investment in scientific research.\\nNational Education Association President Dennis Van Roekel praised the president in a statement, which said, “President Obama’s bold vision offers both hope and help to Americans.”\\nAnd Wendy Puriefoy, president of the Public Education Network, said the president’s focus on education was very much needed.\\n“The president was on target in making clear the connection between a quality public education and a sound economy, and in underscoring the importance of staying in school, especially for poor kids,” Puriefoy said in a statement to Roll Call. “The president’s proposals are very much in line with our own priorities.”\\nThe banking industry and the president, however, are less likely to agree on priorities. Obama had some sharp words for that sector.\\nFor example, Obama said he is sending Congress a plan to help homeowners refinance their mortgages with the current historically low interest rates and no more “runaround from the banks. A small fee on the largest financial institutions will ensure that it won’t add to the deficit, and will give banks that were rescued by taxpayers a chance to repay a deficit of trust.”\\nBanking lobbyists didn’t exactly cheer that statement.\\n“It just reiterated what we’ve known for a while: The president does not like banks,” said Richard Hunt, president of the Consumer Bankers Association, which represents regional and large banks. “We got the memo on that.”\\nEven some of those progressive groups the White House reached out to didn’t come away from the speech completely satisfied.\\nLisa Gilbert, deputy director of Public Citizen’s Congress Watch division, said some of her biggest concerns came over Obama’s rhetoric around regulations. It’s a politically loaded area, with the business community blasting the administration for overregulating business and hurting jobs.\\nObama called for Congress to “tear down regulations that prevent aspiring entrepreneurs from getting the financing to grow.” And he added, “There is no question that some regulations are outdated, unnecessary or too costly. In fact, I’ve approved fewer regulations in the first three years of my presidency than my Republican predecessor did in his. I’ve ordered every federal agency to eliminate rules that don’t make sense.”\\nGilbert didn’t like what she heard. “We certainly need to be smart about what regulations are put in place, but they are critical public protections.”\\nEven though Terry O’Neill, president of the National Organization for Women, did not hear Obama make a commitment to women’s reproductive freedom, she said he gave her enough particularly by endorsing the idea of equal pay for women — a NOW priority.\\n“I listened to the entire State of the Union speech and listened to Mitch Daniels after that,” she said, referring to the Indiana governor who delivered the Republican rebuttal. “And after that entire experience, I was over the moon with Obama.”\\nWhen it comes to the president’s jobs agenda, O’Neill, like the Retail Federation’s French, said the president should have placed less emphasis on manufacturing jobs — traditionally men’s jobs — and more on retail, nursing, teaching and other jobs dominated by women.\\n“On net, women have lost almost 300,000 jobs since the summer of 2009,” she said. “I’m all for manufacturing jobs, but there is an enormous amount of need for jobs for nurses and social workers, teachers, retail workers, hotel maids and day care providers.”\\nBut don’t expect lobbyists in the manufacturing sector to come away from the speech without their gripes, too.\\nJay Timmons, president and CEO of the National Association of Manufacturers, issued a post-State of the Union statement attacking the administration’s decision last week to reject the Keystone XL pipeline despite “the promise of nearly 20,000 manufacturing and construction jobs along with the 118,000 indirect jobs that would ripple across our economy.”\\nTimmons said the pipeline could have accomplished many of the goals espoused in the State of the Union address and, “Its rejection undermines the president’s commitment to them.”',\n",

Cable One made noise in April when it stopped carrying 15 Viacom channels saying that they had become too expensive with programming that’s too easy to find online. Here’s one consequence: It ended Q3 with 476,233 video subs – down 15.1% from the same period last year — according to GHC’s earnings report out today.\\nBut Cable One doesn’t seem to mind, largely because profits went up, which GHC attributed to the 4% decline in its operating expenses. It eeked out a 1% increase in operating income to $40.1 million. That gave the cable operation an operating profit margin of 20.5% on revenues of $195.7M, up from a 19.6% margin on $202.4M last year. The cable unit says it “continues its focus on higher margin businesses, namely high-speed data and business sales.” With programming costs rising, “video sales now have less value and emphasis.” In addition, cable “continues its focus on higher lifetime value customers who are less attracted by discounting, require less support and churn less.”\\nNFL And Pluto TV Team For Streaming Channel \"Celebrating\" Pro Football\\'s Past\\nA Viacom spokesperson says that “despite CableOne’s positioning, the dramatic sub losses they have endured, do not reflect a successful business strategy or a model for others.”\\nStill, Guggenheim Securities’ Michael Morris says the results are “significant for the broader industry,” despite Cable One’s small size. “We believe investors and other pay TV distributors are closely watching the impact of not carrying the Viacom networks on Cable One.” Although big cable operators have different operating metrics than smaller ones do, Cable One’s stable financial report is “a relative negative as [Viacom] negotiates future carriage agreements.”\\nGHC was known as The Washington Post Co before it sold the namesake newspaper to Amazon’s Jeff Bezos last year.\\nSubscribe to Deadline Breaking News Alerts and keep your inbox happy.',\n",

       " {'text': 'Bridging Research and Policy to Address World Challenges\\nNew World Challenges\\nIn the post-1989 period, important changes have occurred in the organisation of the world economy and of world politics more broadly. The new global (dis)order is characterised by both interdependence and mutual vulnerability among world regions and nation-states. The intensification of linkages and connections driven by technology, trade, investment, aid, and the mobility of people and ideas is transforming states and societies around the world.\\nThe period of uncontested American hegemony is waning; a new multipolar international system is emerging, underscored by the eclipse of the G7/G8 of western powers by the G20. The growing weight of countries such as China, India and Brazil points to a relative decline in the power and influence of the ‘West’, especially within the international political economy. Demands for the supply of public goods at both the regional and international level are rising, but significant – and in some cases rising – barriers to their provision confound policymakers.\\nThe European Union (EU) is drawn into a web of global governance as it tries to shape – and is also shaped by – international regimes, bilateral and multilateral agreements that comprise today’s patterns of transnational governance.\\nResearch and Policy\\nResearch conducted at the Global Governance Programme aims to identify the medium- and long-term challenges that the world faces, and possible ways to address them.\\nGlobal thinkers and leaders, academics and senior officials, constitute the pool of experts on whom the Programme can draw for inspired and cutting- edge debates on the problems the world currently faces. The Programme fosters dialogue between the worlds of research and policy in an objective, evidence-based manner, and seeks to contribute robust and critical thinking to important questions of policy and institutional design.\\nThe Programme has been represented at meetings hosted by the European Union Institute for Security Studies (EUISS) to discuss a global foreign policy and security strategy for the EU. It also hosts conferences, seminars, and workshops on Europe’s external relations that bring together scholars and policymakers. In April 2016, for example, the Programme hosted a workshop on ‘China’s Rise and Europe’s Response’, a critical issue for Europe’s international relations. Speakers explored policy areas in which there has been a convergence of perspectives and policies between the EU and China, and issues on which there continues to be disagreement and discord. Individual panels were devoted to exploring the security, economic, political and normative dimensions of EU-China relations. In June 2017 and 2018 two conferences on ‘Terrorism and Security Governance’ were held in Florence and co-sponsored by NATO’s Public Diplomacy Division.\\nThe Programme regularly organises academic and policy workshops that address major challenges related to the governance of cultural diversity in Europe and the world today. In March 2014, a policy workshop was held with all the leading international organisations that deal with minority and migrant rights and integration, including the Council of Europe, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the International Organization for Migration (IOM), the European Commission, and the European Parliament.\\nSimilarly, in summer 2015 the Programme held a large conference on ‘secularism’ to discuss how religious diversity is managed in Asia, the Middle East, and Oceania, and what lessons Europe can draw from those experiences. In spring 2016, experts from Europe, North America, and Australia gathered to discuss how greater mobility and interconnectedness of migrants and diasporas with both countries of origin and destination affect our policies and practices of integration, as well as our models of citizenship and belonging. More recently, in May 2017, a workshop on ‘EU International Cultural Relations: a Strategic Approach‘ was organised to explore the role of culture in EU diplomacy. This year, in April 2018, a policy workshop, hosted by the European Commission Coordinator on Combatting Antisemitism Katharina Schnurbein, on ‘Addressing Rising Antisemitism in Europe’ discussed ways to increase the acknowledgment of Antisemitism as a societal problem.\\nThe Global Governance Programme is also regularly represented in events and debates on trade and investment at the World Trade Organisation (WTO), the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), the International Trade Centre (ITC) and leading think tanks. It acts for example as the knowledge partner for the International Centre for Trade and Sustainable Development (ICTSD)/World Economic Forum (WEF) Expert-15 group on trade and regulatory cooperation, which brings together leading scholars and practitioners. In September 2016 and 2018 the Programme hosted in Florence the World Trade Forum in collaboration with World Trade Institute.\\nThe Programme also serves as a venue for offline deliberations between senior trade and economic development officials, including WTO Ambassadors and managers of international agencies. It maintains strong ties to Geneva-based international organisations, and in 2015 it was selected as the only European venue to reflect on the first 20 years of the operation of the WTO Appellate Body.\\nExplore Further: Latest Policy Dialogues\\n‘World trade Forum’, 28-29 September 2018\\nOn 28-29 September more than 100 trade practitioners, and scholars, government officials, and representatives of international and nongovernmental organizations participated in the 2018 World Trade Forum.\\n‘Terrorism and Security Governance’, 22 June 2018',\n",

I enjoy writing these posts as a record of how our family is growing, and what’s going on in our lives. I think it keeps my writing fresh & honest. We love that it helps new clients get to know us better… it so fun to meet people for the first time and hear that they feel like they’ve known us for years.\\nBut my brain?

I love that we have been coming to Port Aransas for so many years in a row, and our kids know the town and love it. I cherish these images of them we capture every year, on the same beach, showing how much they’ve grown. Our beautiful children…\\nWe went on a Dolphin Watching tour one morning, out of Woody’s. It was SO fun. We got to see lots of dolphins (although my pictures of them aren’t that wonderful), and the boat was really big & nice.\\nAs part of the tour that Jack REALLY loved, our boat got attacked by pirates! 🙂 They shot us with water guns and came aboard to sword fight with some of the passengers. It was such a blast!\\nDorothy wasn’t such a fan.\\nI think my favorite part of the morning was when the first mate (a one eyed, scarred up old sailor with stories about shark attacks) pulled all sorts of sea creatures up in a net and let the kids hold the safe ones!\\nIt was just a short walk from our room at the Princess down to the beach, which is nice when you’re the kind of people that take a lot of stuff to the beach. 🙂\\nMy dad bought a really cool kite, and it brought back so many memories of him flying trick kites when I was a little kid!\\nWe didn’t get any pictures of the stingray that got me, nor did we photograph my foot when it was huge & purple & bleeding… but we got a picture of the crab that stabbed Mack, so that’ll have to do. 🙂\\nOn Friday before we made the 6.5 hour trek home, we went to the USS Lexington in Corpus Christi. My dad is a WWII buff, so he’s been wanting to go for years. We all really enjoyed the tours!\\nThere’s no such thing as an attractive group picture on the beach. Someone is always squinting. No one’s hair is done. WHATEVER. These photos of our family together are priceless. We’re so grateful for such a great relationship with my folks, and fun travel times together!\\nIt’s hard to believe that school will start for Jack in less than two weeks, and that after our upcoming wedding in the Dominican Republic and a quick trip to Vegas, the fall wedding season is going to kick off with a bang.

       " {'text': '8 Surprising Ways You Can Kick Your Sugar Addiction\\nHere’s how to detox from sugar like a nutritionist, for fewer pesky cravings and mood dips—and possibly a little weight loss as a bonus.\\nDon’t cut out sugar (completely)\\nQuitting sugar cold turkey is too drastic—and a recipe for bingeing, or at least reverting to old habits. “Slow and steady wins the race,” says Tiphani Seibert-Martinez, MS, director of patient education at the Minnesota Center for Obesity, Metabolism, and Endocrinology. Making small, simple changes to your nutrition is easier to sustain, especially since you can train your taste buds to enjoy things that aren’t as sweet over time, Martinez says. Not to mention that the anxiety of trying to avoid “all sugar” creates stress. And stress turns on the “fight or flight” mechanisms, increasing production of hormones that can raise blood sugar levels and suppress immune function, both which can minimize the benefits of eliminating sugar in the first place. Start by learning about these surprising foods high in sugar.\\nTake a drink\\nOf water, that is. Adina Niemerow, CN, a culinary nutritionist and author of Super Cleanse, is a true believer that “food heals.” According to Niemerow, sugar cravings could be a sign that you’re dehydrated. Before you hit the vending machine, drink a glass of water and then wait a few minutes to see what happens,” she says. These are the clear signs you’ve been OD-ing on sugar.\\nLearn all the names for sugar\\nThe ingredient “agave nectar” may not seem like a red flag, but sugar goes by many names. Some terms to look for include lactose, brown rice syrup, molasses, and dextrose, to name just a few. What’s worse, sugar can hide in foods where you least expect it: Barbecue sauce, pasta sauce, reduced-fat salad dressings, breads, baked beans, and some flavored coffees can be packed with sugar. Get in the habit of reading labels, and filter out high-sugar foods before they hit your shopping cart.\\nChill out and go to bed\\nWhen tired or stressed, your body will crave energy—usually in the form of sugar. These cravings are often a result of being sleep-deprived, going to bed late, or waking up too early. Niemerow recommends trying to nab a good eight hours of sleep a night. “And if you have to burn the midnight oil and start craving sweets, other experts say, reach for a small snack. Here are the secrets people on a low-sugar diet swear by to avoid sugar bombs.\\nTake a hike\\nWhen you cut your sugar intake, your body will want a new source of energy, and believe it or not, you can get it from exercise. Physical activity helps balance your blood sugar levels, reduce tension, and boost your energy levels, according to Niemerow. She recommends starting with 10 minutes a day and building up gradually as you’re comfortable. And per Martinez, increased activity can increase your endorphins or “happy hormones,” lessening sugar cravings and improving mood naturally. “You’ll start to feel better and want healthier foods,” she says. Try these other tricks for pumping up your body’s natural endorphins.\\nPack in protein\\nEating protein is an easy way to curb sugar cravings. “High-protein foods digest more slowly, keeping you feeling fuller for longer, and they don’t make your blood sugar spike the way refined carbs and sugars do,” Martinez says. Choose proteins like lean chicken, low-fat yogurt, eggs, nuts, and legumes such as beans, chickpeas, and lentils. Niemerow also suggests balancing proteins with lots of vegetables—if your plate has ample servings of green vegetables with all their filling fiber, that will also help curb cravings.\\nCut back on coffee\\nThe roller coaster ups and downs of a caffeine high include dehydration and blood sugar swings, which cause more frequent sugar cravings, says Niemerow. When trying to kick a sugar habit, try to reduce coffee to one cup a day. If caffeine is your crutch, Niemerow recommends brewing matcha tea or green tea from Japan instead of knocking back yet another espresso or latté. This is what happens to your body when you quit drinking coffee.\\nWatch your language\\nSimply being cognizant of how you talk about your sugar detox can also be beneficial, says Martinez. Think of your new dedication to a lower-sugar lifestyle in positive terms, such as “good nutrition” and “more physical activity” rather than as deprivation. Psychological research shows that even saying “I don’t eat sugar” is more effective than saying “I can’t eat sugar,” because “don’t” implies that this habit is a choice you’re making and is under your control, while “can’t” suggests that it’s a rule you have to follow, which often feels oppressive.

They probe the questions of technology and destiny, war and politics that have captured readers’ imaginations for generations.I, Robot,\\nthe first and most widely read book in Asimov’s Robot series, is a collection of nine stories that forever changed the world’s perception of artificial intelligence. Here are stories of sensitive robots, robots gone mad, mind-reading robots, prankster robots, and closeted robots that secretly dominate politics. Chronicling the robot’s development from primitive prototype to ultimate perfection, I, Robot\\nblends scientific fact with science fiction in Asimov’s provocative style.Foundation, Foundation and Empire,\\nand Second Foundation\\ntell the story of Hari Seldon, a brilliant visionary who synthesized history, psychology, and mathematical probability to shape a bold commandment for the future and steer humanity through a series of brutal eras. Following the collapse of a Galactic Empire, Hari gathered together the top scientists and scholars on a bleak planet at the very edge of the Galaxy in order to preserve the accumulated knowledge of mankind. He called his sanctuary the Foundation and designed it to withstand a dark age of ignorance, barbarism, and warfare that would last for the next thirty thousand years. But not even Hari could have predicted the intense barbarism lurking in space, or the birth of an extraordinary creature whose mutant intelligence would destroy all that Hari held dear.\\nThe questions, discussion topics, and author biography that follow are intended to enhance your reading of these four classics written by one of the most widely recognized fiction authors of our time.I, Robot\\n0-553-80371-9 (hardcover)Foundation and Empire\\n0-553-80372-7 (hardcover)Second Foundation\\nQuestions and Topics for Discussion\\n1. Do Asimov’s now-famous Three Laws of Robotics mirror humanity’s ethics code in any way? Whose orders are human beings required to obey? Do our definitions of “harm” ever lead to the same confounding dilemmas experienced in I, Robot?\\n2. Why was Gloria’s mother unable to accept Robbie as an excellent nursemaid? Was Robbie premonitory on Asimov’s part—a prediction that children in the twenty-first century might form intense emotional attachments to electronics?\\n3. Cutie (QT) questions his origins and finds it impossible to believe that a human created him. In what ways did Powell and Donovan reinforce this belief?\\n4. Does the case of Stephen Byerley indicate that robots might make better politicians? Would this only hold true if, as the novel envisions, nations dissolve into massive world regions?\\n5. What is the ultimate commodity produced by U.S. Robot & Mechanical Men, Inc.? Does our global workforce follow this model in any way? Were humor and compassion inevitable traits in the robots? Do these traits interfere with productivity in the world of I, Robot?\\n6. In the book’s closing lines, Dr. Susan Calvin tells the narrator, “You will see what comes next,” as robots stand between mankind and destruction. How did her career lead up to such a precarious conclusion?\\n7. I, Robot has been turned into a major motion picture starring Will Smith. How does the movie compare with your book-reading experience? What do you think of the adjustments made and liberties taken when converting this collection of stories to one seamless film adaptation?\\n8. Foundation opens with the perspective of Gaal Dornick, “a country boy who had never seen Trantor before.” What is the effect of opening the novel with Gaal’s observations? Why did Hari Seldon extend such an invitation to Gaal?\\n9. In the trial portrayed in chapter 6, the Commission’s Advocate repeatedly rejects Hari’s deductions regarding the future. What has made Hari a target for exile? Why are his projections—supported by seemingly irrefutable logic and mathematics—so easily dismissed by his accusers?\\n10. Part 3 of Foundation begins with an entry from the Encyclopedia Galactica that reads, “Undoubtedly the most interesting aspect of the history of the four Kingdoms involves the strange society forced temporarily upon it during the administration of Salvor Hardin.” In what ways does Hardin distinguish himself from the other rulers described in the novel? What conditions fostered his rise to power?\\n11. The Foundation is intended in some ways as a kind of religious center. What are its doctrines? Can a religion of science fail?\\n12. Discuss the novel’s references to energy—in this case, nuclear power—in relation to political and economic supremacy. What other forces drive the novel’s hierarchies of dominance? How does the role of the Traders evolve in the novel’s closing chapters?\\n13. What were the root causes of the Foundation’s fall? Could its demise have been avoided, even after war had begun?\\n14. As Lord of the Universe, is Cleon II naïve or perceptive? In what ways do his sensibilities affect his fate?\\n15. What, ultimately, is the source of the Mule’s power to perform Conversions in Foundation and Empire? What role did psychology play in his own origins?\\n16. Do the Independent Trading Worlds accurately perceive their vulnerabilities? In contrast, what perpetuated Neotrantor’s survival?\\n17. Bayta’s final conversation with the Mule explains his moniker as well as his perceptions of how power is perpetuated. What does this dialogue indicate about gender roles in the realm of the Second Foundation, and about the possibility of democracy?\\n18. Discuss the spectrum of characters affected by the Mule in Second Foundation’s five opening interludes. In what ways do the Mule’s tactics vary?\\n19. In what ways does Bail Channis’s personality reflect a cultural shift from the previous Foundation novels?\\n20. Near the beginning of the fifteenth chapter, Arcadia is described as “dressed in borrowed clothes, standing on a borrowed planet in a borrowed situation of what seemed even to be a borrowed life.” In what ways is she both an unlikely and an ideal savior?\\n21. Scholarship such as the Encyclopedia project represented Hari’s belief in the power of learning (and even the power of the mind itself, in the form of neural microcurrents). To what extent is a civilization’s success measured by the survival of its knowledge?\\n22. The final chapter of Second Foundation offers a thoughtful coda to the novel. What is the “true” question to that chapter’s “answer that was true?”\\n23. If Hari Seldon’s equations were applied to Earth’s societies, what might the results be?\\n24. What connotations and root words were you able to derive from the character names and geographic locations featured in the series?\\n25. How does the series evolve as a whole? What overarching narrative is propelled by the events that occur within the individual books?\\n26. Isaac Asimov wrote these three books very early in his career, during the 1950s—an era marked by the Cold War, McCarthyism, and the early stages of the space race. How might the events of this period have shaped the Foundation storyline?\\n27.

Peterson III issued a 48-page recommended order calling for the denial of what is known as a “certificate of need” for Encompass Health Rehabilitation Hospital of Escambia County, LLC.\\nThe state Agency for Health Care Administration in 2017 issued a preliminary denial of the certificate of need, but Encompass pursued the case in the Division of Administrative Hearings.\\nUnder administrative law, Peterson’s recommended order will now go back to the agency for a final decision.\\nCertificates of need are a key regulatory approval needed to move forward with such projects as new hospitals or nursing homes. Peterson rejected Encompass’ arguments that a region including Escambia County has a lack of access and choices for patients who need rehabilitation care.\\nAlso, he ruled that approving the new facility could adversely affect rehabilitation hospitals affiliated with West Florida Regional Medical Center and Fort Walton Beach Medical Center.\\n“Instead of promoting or enhancing quality, approval of the project would add additional pressures on limited staffing resources in District 1 (the region including Escambia County) necessary to maintain current staffing and quality,” Peterson wrote in part of the decision. “The evidence was otherwise insufficient to show that additional competition would stimulate quality or cost efficiency.”\\nCopyright 2019 Health News Florida',\n",

We Know What You’re Thinking…\\n“Why is this property being sold at auction?”\\n“It must be bank-owned and distressed”\\n“The sellers are hiding something”\\nBut Here’s What No One’s Told You About Auction\\nAuction levels the playing field when it comes to buying land, residential, and commercial real estate. As a potential buyer, you take part in a fair competition on the same terms as all other bidders. You know the closing date in advance. You know you’re bidding with no contingencies. You know your competition, and you know exactly what other potential buyers can offer.\\nFor over 75 years, the Cates Auction family has provided buyers with an open and transparent way to bid-on and buy quality real estate. While our commitment to our bidders has remained unchanged for 4 generations, our approach continually advances with cutting-edge technology.\\nHow Buying at Auction Works\\nWe’ve redefined the role technology plays in auction to offer buyers full transparency and complete control. Buying a property doesn’t have to be difficult, which is why we offer our buyers access to all property information, inspections, and disclosures. That property you’ve been vying for? It’s only a search away.\\nConventional loans are normally used when a buyer needs to finance an auction property.\\nOpen houses are held at the property prior to the auction end date. Private showings are also available upon request.\\nYes, Cates Auction works with buyer’s and seller’s agents. Your buyer’s agent has a responsibility to represent your best interests, as well as provide you with valuable information to help you make an informed buying decision.\\nA one-year home warranty is normally included in the purchase of a single-family residential property at auction.\\nYou must register to bid online, accept the auction terms, and provide valid credit card information. If you are planning to obtain a loan to finance the purchase, a copy of your pre-approval letter should be provided.',\n",

       " {'text': \"This article originally appeared on VICE France.\\nBeing on lockdown can be very tough for people with addictions and compulsions. The constant isolation can highlight our destructive relationship with a substance of choice, whether it be food, drugs, gambling, or sex. But while we can still stock up on food or have drugs delivered (at your own risk), getting laid is very much at odds with social distancing measures.\\nPeople might be feeling extra horny in isolation but sex addiction (or hypersexuality disorder), isn’t the same thing as a strong libido. And while experts disagree on whether sex addiction should be a formal medical diagnosis (it's not currently listed in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders), they do agree that compulsive sexual behavior can be damaging to people's mental health and personal lives. Psychiatrist Laurent Karila said compulsive sexual behavior can be triggered by boredom, stress, or fear of failure—emotions pretty much synonymous with the current lockdown.\\nJean-Victor Blanc, head of the addiction department at Saint-Antoine Hospital in Paris, said the majority of patients seeking help with him for sex addiction are men from the queer community. In his work with them, he has identified two types of sex addicts. Chemsex addicts, who take recreational drugs to enhance their sexual experiences, while the second type are those with an uncontrollable sexual appetite. Through friends of friends, I got in touch with four sex addicts (two self-reported and two diagnosed by specialists) from this community, to learn more about how their life has changed now that they can’t meet up for sex.\\nThéo*, 24, stylist\\nVICE: How was your sex life before lockdown?\\nThéo: I had many partners, often multiple guys at the same time without protection. I’m HIV positive but I have an undetectable viral load [when someone's blood, after years of treatment, contains so little of the virus that a test can't detect it], so the virus isn't transmittable**.** I was having chemsex regularly, usually after parties on the weekend, when my inhibitions have disappeared. Although I keep encounters private, a few people around me know about my sex life.\\nAre you getting off online now?\\nNo, surprisingly! I masturbate once a day, twice if I get turned on by two hot guys in a TV series, a raunchy Instagram account, or a suggestive text.\\nDo you feel tempted to go out and have sex?\\nFor now, I just watch porn if I really want to fuck. When the urge is too strong, I chat on Grindr until it gets too close to meeting IRL, then I cut it off. I think I’d feel like a real idiot right after cumming [if I met up with someone] because I’d have to lie to my friends about not being able to resist.\\nJonathan*, 37, restaurant owner\\nVICE: How was your sex life before the lockdown?\\nJonathan: I’ve been in a relationship since last August. Unfortunately, we weren't having sex often because I would jerk off obsessively for two to seven hours a day. I would touch myself so much my dick would bleed sometimes. I told myself every day that it would be the last time. My boyfriend and some friends knew about it, but I still felt misunderstood.\\nDoes it interfere with your life?\\nEnormously. I need to be alone to do it, which prevents me from doing things and opening up to people.\\nAre you watching more porn?\\nStrangely, no. Probably because I have more time to myself and I no longer have fear of missing out, like not being able to sleep with someone because I can't get hard or because I’m in a relationship. I don’t have to worry about getting HIV, which my grandfather died of. I still have bad habits, but I don’t feel the need to escape reality because there is less pressure. I mean, I still jerk off, but not even every day.\\nWould you say that the lockdown is having a positive impact on you?\\nYes, it's a good thing. My boyfriend comes to see me every three days and I've noticed how difficult I've been with him and how that stems from my inability to love. Now I can be more present instead of getting lost in my fantasies and self-degradation.\\nFranck*, 49, real estate manager\\nVICE: Can you tell me how much sex you were having before the lockdown?\\nFranck: I used to have 8 to 15 hookups per week depending on my schedule, sometimes with multiple guys at once. I’d also masturbate every day. It was almost always unprotected, I’m on PrEP [a drug preventing HIV infections]. I had a few regular partners, but most of my casual meetings were through the apps.\\nHow are you coping with the isolation?\\nI’m trying to stay in control otherwise I could easily spend the whole day with my dick in my hand and toys up my ass. A week after the beginning of the lockdown, I was super horny and I masturbated compulsively. Two weeks in, I've managed to calm down a bit but I’m having a hard time with my impulses. For example, when I go food shopping and I walk past guys, I stare at them and feel the urge to approach them, even though I know we need to keep our distance.\\nDo you think you'll pull through?\\nIf we are asked to stay in quarantine for another two or three months, I’m worried I’d give in to the temptation to hook up, but I’d still take maximum precautions.\\nEtienne*, 38, business manager\\nVICE: How was your sex life before the lockdown?\\nEtienne: Before the lockdown, I would hookup at least once a day, usually twice. Although I’m on PrEP, I use protection. I’ve always been terrified of STDs and I’ve been very lucky not to catch anything.\\nDid it take up a lot of space in your social life?\\nChemsex removed any barrier I needed to stay safe and not fuck for hours on end. At the beginning it was fun, but over time it became the center of my life to the detriment of my relationships. I was totally aware that I was harming myself, but I couldn't avoid it. I gradually realized how damaging it was for so many young guys, so I stopped. My friends know that I have an intense relationship with sex, but they’d never suspect it to be such a burden on my life.\\nAre you finding it hard to respect the lockdown?\\nNo, it's been much easier than expected. I’m stress-free, I sleep like a baby, I think not being under pressure is doing me a lot of good. Although I am watching a lot more porn.\\nWhat are your hopes for after the lockdown?\\nI'd like to put something out there. If everyone got tested before sleeping around again we could potentially slow down another public health issue: the STD epidemic.\\n*Names changed for privacy.\",\n",

Possible herpesvirus infections include HHV-6/7, Epstein-Barr Virus and Cytomegalovirus.\\nChronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) Physicians Report…\\nDr. Guyer believes Valcyte is a ‘significant step forward’ in the treatment of patients with a documented viral infection. He reports mostly ‘encouraging results’ from a small set of patients he has treated. Dr. Holtof reports Valcyte is effective in patients with infectious onset, evidence of viral reactivation (elevated IgG/Ea for EBV, HHV-6, CMV), high RNase L activity, low NK cell activity, and other immune findings. Dr. Peterson warns that 3 months may be too short a trial period and cites many patients with no benefits at three months who have had significant benefits at six months. Dr. Enlander reports its effects range from highly dramatic to minimal.\\nDr. Podell suggests, however, that patients with a ‘decent quality of life’ refrain from taking Valcyte given it’s potentially serious side effects.\\nChronic Fatigue Syndrome (ME/CFS) Studies\\nIn a preliminary study Dr. Montoya reported that 21/25 ME/CFS patients with documented EBV/HHV-6 infection, several of which were severely disabled, improved dramatically with many returning to work or full time activities after 6 months treatment with Valcyte. `Side effects were low and there were no relapses after the treatment was ended.\\nDr. Anthony Komaroff, MD, professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School reported “This study is small and preliminary, but potentially very important. If a randomized trial confirmed the value of this therapy for patients like the ones studied here, it would be an important landmark in the treatment of this illness.”\\nA randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded treatment trial sponsored by Roche Pharmaceuticals began in spring, 2007. The study results were not nearly as impressive and as of 2012 had not been published.\\n(From Dr. Lerner’s ME/CFS Treatment Guide). Dr. Lerner recommends “valganciclovir (Valcyte) one 450-mg capsule daily for three days, followed by two 450-mg capsules in the morning daily. Liver function tests are studied very carefully. If there is any abnormality, one alters the dosage. Given the patient’s ability to safely tolerate two 450-mg capsules, dosing can be increased to two, 450-mg capsules in the morning and a one additional 450-mg capsule twelve hours later. Liver function tests, again, must be studied carefully and frequently.\\nBoth valacyclovir and valganciclovir are absorbed with a 20% increment if there is food in the stomach.”\\nthe list of potential side effects is long and includes liver toxicity, anemia, reduced white blood cell counts (granulocytopenia), reduced blood platelets (thrombocytopenia), reduced bone marrow levels and reduced fertility. Valcyte may also be carcinogenic. These can increase the risk of infection, anemia and bleeding. It can cause life-threatening side effects. This drug is counter-indicated in patients with low white blood cells, platelets or hemoglobin counts.\\nPatients are usually tightly monitored (up to twice weekly in the early stages) for liver toxicity and the dosage is lowered or stopped if side effects occur.

Dubas said he received calls about defenseman Tyson Barrie, but didn’t get what he needed back as part of the return. As a result, he didn’t move him and has risked losing him for nothing in free agency.\\nOf course, many will argue Dubas created his own problems in this area by signing so many expensive contracts at forward and that he’ll try to fix those problems by spending more over the summer as the salary cap increases.\\nRelated: Top 3 All-Time Capitals Goalies\\nJets to Spend Money In Free Agency?\\nSpeaking of cap increases, Mike McIntyre of the Winnipeg Free Press writes that the projected salary cap increase for next year will entice teams to spend a little more and one of those teams could be the Winnipeg Jets.\\nJets GM Kevin Cheveldayoff to go shopping with an extra $4-$6 million to spend and with the termination of Dustin Byfuglien’s contract likely during the summer, the Jets could have as much as $22 million in available funds.

       " {'text': 'When thinking about the new skills they need to acquire to further their careers, most entrepreneurs focus on marketing or leadership skills. Both areas are important for business, but there is also a third skill that is essential: effective communication. Indeed, being a good communicator is vital to a company. Below, you’ll see why.\\nWhat are the Types of Business Communication?\\nWhen talking about business communication, one must divide it into two categories: internal and external. Both are vital for the well-functioning of your company. Let’s define each one:\\n- External communication. It refers to how you interact with other businesses, partners, etc.\\n- Internal communication. This is an often unnoticed aspect that refers to how you communicate within your enterprise.\\nInternal communication divides further into three categories: lateral, upward, and downward. Lateral communication refers to how well you interact with your colleagues and equals. Meanwhile, upward communication concerns your skill in talking to your superiors.\\nWhat about downward communication? That focuses on interactions with your employees and subordinates. In other words, those who are on a lower level than you in the company.\\nWhy does External Communication Matter?\\nEnsuring that you put up a professional front immediately smooths over any business interactions you might have, both now and in the future. The way you carry yourself and how you interact with other professionals dictates how they will perceive you and how much or how little they will respect you.\\nIt also affects how inclined they are to do business with you. Good external communication builds trust because it is essentially showing the world that you have your things in order and are competent.\\nTo enhance your communication skills and build the confidence of those around you, brush up on your skillset. The Influential Communicator business certificate can help you do exactly that.\\nIs Internal Communication as Important as External?\\nWhile many businesses are aware of how important how they relate with other organizations is and how they handle their external communication, relatively few take an interest in internal communication. That oversight could be seriously affecting their business, for a few reasons:\\nFirstly, good internal communication increases employee satisfaction and, subsequently, productivity. If you give your employees fewer reasons for discontent, they will be better able to apply themselves to the tasks at hand.\\nSecondly, strong internal communication strengthens relationships within the company. Interpersonal relationships dictate so much of life.\\nGood relationships are built on trust and empathy. By properly communicating with your colleagues and subordinates, you improve their trust and desire to work together towards a common goal.\\nSo, what are you doing to improve communication inside and outside your company?\\nFinal Words on Improving Communication\\nFor internal lateral communication, talk about it. Instead of hoarding various dissatisfaction points with your colleagues, work your way through them before they become a problem.\\nAs for internal downward communication, keep things clear and professional, but don’t be afraid to show you are human. By building a personal relationship with your employees, you bring them closer to the company.\\nRegarding internal upward communication, keep things efficient and professional. Do not assume too much familiarity, but also don’t do anything to further the gap between ranks. If you think you should, speak up.\\nLastly, for external communication, keep things polite and professional. Often, simple is best.',\n",

When you consider the number of people who will be using it over the next several years, then you can begin to understand the importance of this technology. In this article, we will discuss the many advantages that are associated with e-learning.\\nFor example, in the case of medical professionals, this kind of education is a great way to save them a lot of time and money. By taking on the role of a technician or doctor, they will not only get better pay for their efforts, but also have a good job and a high quality of life. This is certainly something that everyone who cares about health should want to see happen.\\nAs a matter of fact, there are more than one million medical students who are enrolled in different medical institutions around the country. There are many reasons why so many people want to go to medical school. In order to get into medical school and learn everything that they can about this profession, they need to know how much money it will take, how long it will take them to complete it, and what the benefits of attending medical school are.\\nIn the case of many people, it will take them longer than they would like to go to medical school. By going online, they will be able to study when they want, without having to worry about going to class.\\nFurthermore, since they can take the course at any time that they wish, they can continue learning even after they have graduated from medical school. With all the knowledge that they have gained through learning and practicing, they can help make the world a better place.\\nIn addition to medical professionals, you will find that the benefits of e-learning are really the same for everyone. For example, teachers will benefit from it because they can do it when they have the children to teach. Teachers will also be able to save time because it will allow them to do other important things while keeping their children occupied.\\nIt may take some time before you find the right type of course for you. It is important to think carefully about what you are looking for and how much you are willing to pay. If you want the best results, then it is a good idea to look for one that has plenty of information available to you.\\nAlso, it is a good idea to talk to a professional who is familiar with e-learning before you make any purchases. This will give you an idea of the different types of courses that are available and will help you make the best choice.\\nE-Learning is very convenient. There is no need to travel anywhere, since you can take the course from the comfort of your own home. You can learn all kinds of topics in the comfort of your own home, without the hassle or expense of travel.\\nOnline courses will cost you less money, since you will not have to pay for books or supplies.

Since you can study at your own pace, there will be no pressure on you to get it done as fast as possible, so that you will not get frustrated when you miss a lesson.\\nOnline e-learning courses can also be used for the purposes of training employees. There are many employers who use online courses to train their employees so that they can gain a competitive edge over the competition. These courses help them work together as a team, thus making their job easier.\\nIt is also very helpful for medical professionals to use these courses. As they are able to save money by doing it online, they will have more time to spend with patients and other aspects of their profession. They will be able to get information that they need from the experts who created the courses.',\n",

       " {'text': '|dc.description.abstract||Autonomous mobile robots (ARM’s) are defined by their ability to perform some tasks independently from direct human interaction. However, interaction with humans at some point is necessary. There are some situations in which humans can give instructions to robots most effectively with physical gestures. Example include scenarios that require silence, such as covert military operations or hospital rooms, loud assemblies, underwater, or in space.\\nArtificial neural networks (ANN’s) have long been used for pattern recognition. If well- trained with a suitable dataset, an ANN can provide a satisfactory result for a complex task.\\nROS (Robot Operating System) is a mainstream software framework for robotics research throughout the world. It can streamline the development of robots through code reuse.\\nThis thesis describes a partial solution to help robots understand human gesture by combining an ANN and ROS, with a Kinect sensor as the primary input. Five gestures are trained, and then recognized when performed by people other than the trainer. The overall success rate of gesture recognition in this study is 80 percent. Some gestures are recognized with more than 90 percent success.||en_US',\n",

While designs are developed at Amsterdam, the weaving work is done by the rural Indian artisans. Karigar is actually the collaboration of Pashm and IXXcreates which supports the same aim as that of Pashm. They use 100% natural materials (like Himalayan forest silk, nettle and wool) which are available in the Himalayas.\\nMost of the weavers and embroiders that the company works with are women.\\nKanak Hirani Nautiyal, the founder while visiting Garhwal with her friend Sindhu Holla discovered beautiful handloom scarves made by the local artisans. They then set up Pashm in Amsterdam in 2013, to empower the rural Indian artisans. Later, they partnered with Dutch textile designer Jolijn Fiddelaers and together launched Karigar (a brand of home and fashion textile products) – Dutch-designed and fairly crafted in India using natural materials. As of 2015, the company has retail offices in Netherlands, Germany, Belgium, UK, Austria and Switzerland. In future, the company plans to innovate designs and also connect technology to the rural artisans.\\nThe company works in collaboration with weaving clusters, weaving groups and independent artisans in Garhwal. Around 90% of their products are made in Garhwal, where they work with around 800 skilled rural artisans (silk/wool rearing, nettle/wool carding, spinning, dyeing, weaving, finishing).\\nThe company launched a crowdfunded campaign in 2015.',\n",

An echocardiogram helps your doctor determine whether all parts of the heart wall are contributing normally to your heart’s pumping activity. Areas of heart wall that move weakly may have been damaged during a heart attack, or be receiving too little oxygen.\\nHow long does an echo take?\\nHow long does an echocardiogram take? A standard echocardiogram or a fetal echocardiogram test usually takes about 30 to 60 minutes. A stress echocardiogram usually takes between 60 and 90 minutes.\\nHow long does it take to get the results of an echocardiogram?\\nIt may take several days to several weeks for you to receive the report. Often, because the results are so detailed, your doctor may schedule an appointment with you to discuss the results and next steps. The report should include: The rate of your heartbeat: Normal range is between 60 and 100 beats per minute.\\nHow early can you get a sonogram?\\nWhile most practitioners wait until at least 6 weeks to perform the first ultrasound, a gestational sac can be seen as early as 4 1/2 weeks after your last period; a heartbeat can be detected as early as 5 to 6 weeks (though it might not be detected that early in all cases).\\nHow long does an echo stress test take?\\nThe test takes from 30-60 minutes. Prior to exercising, an echocardiogram is done by applying colorless gel to the chest and placing the echo transducer on top of it. You will also wear a blood pressure cuff to allow blood pressure monitoring.\\nWhat does an echo stress test show?\\nStress echocardiography. Stress echocardiography is a test that uses ultrasound imaging to show how well your heart muscle is working to pump blood to your body. It is most often used to detect a decrease in blood flow to the heart from narrowing in the coronary arteries.\\nAre tumors black or white on ultrasound?\\nThe images produced by a breast ultrasound are in black and white. Cysts, tumors, and growths will appear as dark areas on the scan. A dark spot on your ultrasound doesn’t mean that you have breast cancer. In fact, most breast lumps are benign.\\nHow does fluid look on ultrasound?\\nFluid presents has an anechoic appearance on ultrasound, and can be confirmed with dynamic interrogation as it should respond to pressure. You can see here the anechoic or black appearance of fluid within the superficial infrapatellar bursa of the knee.\\nIs a heart ultrasound the same as an echocardiogram?\\nAlso known as an echocardiogram or ECHO, this type of medical imaging uses a wand-like transducer, or probe, that emits high-frequency sound waves to create an image of your heart. … A heart ultrasound is a non-invasive way to get a look at how well the heart is working.\\nWhat are echoes in ultrasound?\\nAn echocardiogram (echo) is a graphic outline of the heart’s movement. During an echo test, ultrasound (high-frequency sound waves) from a hand-held wand placed on your chest provides pictures of the heart’s valves and chambers and helps the sonographer evaluate the pumping action of the heart.\\nWhat happens when you get a sonogram?\\nThe transducer sends high-frequency sound waves into the body, which reflect off internal structures, including your baby. The sound waves or echoes that reflect back are received by the transducer and transformed into a picture on a screen. These pictures can be printed out or sometimes recorded on a videotape.\\nDo I have to take my bra off for an echocardiogram?\\nTo get good pictures, the probe needs to be covered in a special lubricant gel. Therefore, to have an echocardiogram, you need to take your clothes off from the waist up – including any bra. You will be offered a gown to wear instead. … This helps move the lungs out of the way to get the clearest pictures.\\nHow long does an echo ultrasound take?\\nAn average echocardiogram will take around 20 minutes to 1 hour to complete. Around 5 minutes owill be spent on preparing and positioning the patient for the echocardiogram. 15 minutes on average will be spent acquiring the relevant images of the heart.\\nWhy do I need a sonogram?\\nUltrasound is used for many reasons, including to: View the uterus and ovaries during pregnancy and monitor the developing baby’s health. Diagnose gallbladder disease. Evaluate blood flow.\\nIs it OK to drink coffee before an echocardiogram?\\nDon’t eat or drink anything but water for 4 hours before the test. Don’t drink or eat anything with caffeine (such as cola, chocolate, coffee, tea, or medications) for 24 hours before.\\nWhat are the disadvantages of using ultrasound?\\nWhat are the disadvantages of US?Increased depth means a lower frequency is required for optimal imaging. As a consequence there is a lower resolution. … Anisotropy. Simply this means a structure is highly reflective to ultrasound. … Bone blocks US waves. … Artefacts are common. … Training.\\nIs a sonogram the same thing as an ultrasound?\\nAlthough often used interchangeably, ultrasound is the procedure of using sound waves to create images from inside the body. Sonogram is the image produced by an ultrasound examination.\\nWhat is the best test to check for heart problems?\\nCommon medical tests to diagnose heart conditionsBlood tests. When your muscle has been damaged, as in a heart attack, your body releases substances in your blood. … Electrocardiogram (ECG) … Exercise stress test. … Echocardiogram (ultrasound) … Nuclear cardiac stress test. … Coronary angiogram. … Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) … Coronary computed tomography angiogram (CCTA)\\nCan you wear a bra during an echocardiogram?\\nWear loose, comfortable clothing that is suitable for exercise. Men usually don’t wear a shirt during the test, and women generally wear a bra and a lightweight blouse or a hospital gown. You should also wear comfortable walking shoes or sneakers.',\n",

       " {'text': '(By Ashley Stahl)\\n“A true leader does whatever is required to get the job done. If that means manning the copier, making the midnight coffee run, or assembling folders, that’s what the leader does, even if his paycheck and title suggest such jobs are “beneath” him. This approach not only guarantees that the work gets done; it also does wonders for the energy levels on the team“.\\nAfter months of effort, you finally land the promotion you’ve had your eyes on. On paper, it’s your dream job: You have a bigger team under you, more exciting responsibilities, a direct line of communication to the big boss, a salary that’sactually competitive, and of course, the highly anticipated corner office.\\nBut the day-to-day reality isn’t unfolding quite as you’d hoped.\\nYou’re getting apathetic vibes from your employees, and you don’t know why. You’re doing everything you’re supposed to be doing—managing projects, directing traffic, juggling deadlines and budgets. You’ve even tried bringing cupcakes to the office, but your team’s energy seems to evaporate as soon as the sugar high wears off. You’re left wondering: What more could they possibly want?\\nData tells us that today’s employees want a lot more out of their jobs. In our increasingly educated workforce, employees are no longer satisfied to punch a clock and collect a paycheck. They don’t want to blindly follow instructions handed down from the manager; they want to feel empowered. In fact, recent research shows that teams managed by motivators perform better than those that are too heavily controlled by a designated supervisor.\\nIn short, employees want a Tony Robbins, not a Donald Trump.\\nNo one is saying you need to convene a daily kumbaya circle, but there are some practical steps you can take now to up your game and elevate yourself from a manager to a leader.\\n1. Leaders Know How to Listen\\nLeaders listen to everyone, even those who might not have as much “experience” as other people in the room. In my last corporate job, I worked for the CSO of a Fortune 100 company. At team meetings, he would sit back quietly while the VPs jockeyed loudly for his approval. He would let them monopolize the forum for a little while, and then he would turn his attention to someone who hadn’t bothered to try to compete with the dog and pony show. “What do you think?” he’d ask, giving that person all of his attention. It brought out the best in the quieter people, and it humbled the louder ones.\\nThe best leaders treat brainstorming as a democracy of ideas. One way of getting more invested participation from your employees is to introduce a weekly team meeting where new ideas are solicited from each person. This is a great way to strengthen the team mentality, showing your employees that you want and welcome their brilliance.\\n2. Leaders Know the Difference Between an Amateur and a Pro\\nLeaders earn their stripes through consistent displays of professionalism, not by taking the shortcuts we so often see from amateurs. According to Steven Pressfield, author of Turning Pro, “the difference between an amateur and a professional is in their habits. An amateur has amateur habits. A professional has professional habits. We can never free ourselves from habit. But we can replace bad habits with good ones.” The amateur calls in sick when he’s had too much to drink the night before; the professional shows up early and does his best work, even if his physiology is hating him. If it means he has to give 150% to get the job done, that’s what he gives it. The leader takes full responsibility for his actions and, by doing so, imparts the message to those around him that they need to do the same.\\n3. Leaders Leave Their Egos at the Door\\nA true leader does whatever is required to get the job done. If that means manning the copier, making the midnight coffee run, or assembling folders, that’s what the leader does, even if his paycheck and title suggest such jobs are “beneath” him. This approach not only guarantees that the work gets done; it also does wonders for the energy levels on the team.\\nOne way to implement this is to pay attention to the unique brilliance of each employee on your team. If you see that people are exceptionally good at something, offer to take some work off their plate so you can free them up to make better use of their skill set. If you’re coming up blank on ideas for them, ask them what they’d like to do more of. They will respect you for getting your hands dirty, and they’ll appreciate you for making them feel seen and heard.\\n4. Leaders Live Outside Their Comfort Zone\\nPlaying a big game doesn’t always feel natural or comfortable, but it’s a choice that true leaders make again and again. As kids, we are often conditioned to go with the grain and to avoid disrupting our environment. We often keep ourselves from really being seen, and from being different. The problem here is that this encourages us to grow into very average adults who only feel comfortable when we’re playing small.\\nI’ll never forget the moment I stepped backstage at TEDxBerkeley. As the least seasoned speaker at the time (hello, I went on after Guy Kawasaki), I thought I’d definitely be the most nervous in the room. Boy, was I wrong. The whole group backstage—best-selling authors, innovators, serial entrepreneurs—were all panicked. Nothing this rewarding can possibly exist in your comfort zone, and it’s the leaders who are willing to wake up daily, stepping outside of theirs.\\n5. Leaders Have Emotional Fitness\\nEmotional intelligence—the ability to read and connect with just about anyone in the room—is great, but it doesn’t sustain you in times of uncertainty and instability. It wasn’t until I became a career coach that I learned the importance of emotional fitness. Emotional fitness is your ability to flexibly endure the ups and downs of business and life. The difference between managers and leaders is the way they react to and process the failed deals, the lost clients, and even the busted refrigerator in the break room. Managers freak out, sending tiny ripples of panic and chaos through the rest of the team. Leaders tap into an inner Buddha, an unwavering stillness that empowers them to take a deep breath and keep moving forward.\\nIf I could impart one final insight on you, it’s this: Successful people are simply willing to do what other people aren’t. In exchange for giving more of themselves, they reap much bigger rewards.\\nThey are also patient. Pressfield says, “our work is practice. One bad day is nothing to us. Ten bad days is nothing.” If you are committed to becoming a true leader, don’t be discouraged if the situation doesn’t change overnight—leadership, like all forms of self-improvement, is a journey, not a destination. True leaders understand that it’s not about where they go; it’s about who they become.\\nAshley Stahl is a national security professional turned Career Coach to the Millennial generation.

       " {'text': 'Let’s engage in some trainer-teacher-learner time travel; let’s revel in a wonderfully and gloriously circular learning moment whose beginning and end have not yet stopped expanding—and won’t if you decide to enter into and further expand this moment as part of a connected educator network.\\nIt starts with a simple realization: that participating in a well-organized connectivist MOOC (massive open online course) or any other effective online learning opportunity not only puts us in real-time (synchronous) contact with those we draw into our personal learning networks, but also allows us to extend and connect online conversations with those that began days, weeks, months, or even years before the one we are currently creating, in venues we are just now discovering. It also can easily extend into days, weeks, months, or years we haven’t yet experienced.\\nI am, for example, writing this piece on October 17, 2013, and if you end up reading it on the same day, we’re in a fairly obvious and traditionally synchronous moment—the sort of moment we routinely experience face to face. By connecting this piece to others I’ve been reading and reacting to with colleagues in the Exploring Personal Learning Networks (#xplrpln) that Jeff Merrell and Kimberly Scott are currently facilitating under the auspices of the Northwestern University Master’s in Learning & Organizational Change Program, and by further connecting it to interactions with colleagues via Connected Educator Month, I am in a very rewarding way extending and weaving this moment across weeks and months of conversational threads created by others. They wrote earlier. You and I respond now. They pick up the thread and run with it at some as-yet-undetermined moment. And all of us are in a figuratively synchronous way connected through a conversation and learning opportunity that flows in multiple directions, over multiple platforms, as Pekka Ihanainen (HAAGA-HELIA University of Applied Sciences, Finland) and John Moravec (University of Minnesota, USA) explain in an article they wrote in 2011 and which I explored with a segment of my own personal learning network colleagues in a blog post and other online venues.\\nWe see this in play through the Exploring Personal Learning Networks MOOC, where we are exploring and attempting to define personal learning networks by developing our personal learning networks. We are developing (or further developing) personal learning networks by drawing upon newly-created resources as well as resources that can be weeks, months, years, or even a century old. One colleague suggests that Jules Verne, the nineteenth-century novelist-poet-playwright, is part of his personal learning network in the sense that Verne’s work continues to guide him in his never-ending evolution as a learner. I am suggesting that a colleague from another MOOC is part of my #xplrpln personal learning network via a wonderful article she wrote months before the personal leaning networks MOOC was written and in progress; because her article is inspiring so many of us, she feels as if she is an active member even though personal time constraints are keeping her from posting updated material—for and in the moment. And several of us are suggesting that people who are still alive but with whom we have no one-on-one in-the-moment personal contact still are very much a part of our personal learning networks because they influence and affect our learning through the work they are producing or the examples they provide—something I experienced while participating in #etmooc (Educational Technology & Media MOOC) earlier this year.\\nThat creates a wonderfully dynamic and continually evolving personal learning network—or network of networks—along with a tremendously expansive moment that remains open to further expansion through your participation. And the more we engage with #xplrpln course facilitators Merrell and Scott and course colleagues in the United States, Canada, Great Britain, Ireland, and Australia synchronously and asynchronously, the more we find our own personal learning networks, personal learning environments, affinity spaces, communities of practice, and overall communities of learning overlapping in ways that once again transcend geographic and chronological borders—suggesting that in the world of training-teaching-learning, borders and barriers exist only to be erased (or, at very least, made much more permeable than we often assume they can be).\\nIt’s an obvious extension of the concept of rhizomatic learning—a process of learning that mirrors the spreading of rhizomes so there is no center, just a wonderfully ever-expanding network of learning connections rooted in creation, collaboration, and the building of communities of learning, as I noted after picking up the term from Dave Cormier via #etmooc. The learning rhizomes in our personal learning network now continue to move backward to capture parts of the extended conversation we hadn’t previously noted, and they move forward into the moment you are living and extending in collaboration with the rest of us. Together, we may be on the cusp of even greater collaborations. Learning experiences. And being part of contributing to a world in which connections through time, across time zones, and over geographic boundaries produce possibilities we are only beginning to imagine and bring to fruition.',\n",

       " {'text': 'Freeze away fat with Ottawa CoolSculpting®\\nCoolSculpting is not to be confused with other fat reducing treatments such as liposuction. Although both treatments offer fat reduction there are some major differences. CoolSculpting is a non-surgical, non-invasive option that helps eliminate unwanted, stubborn fat with little to no downtime.\\nHow does CoolSculpting work?\\nCoolSculpting utilizes specifically designed applicators which stick to your skin with a mild suction. Following this, a controlled cooling is released from the applicator. This chills your fat which damages the fat cell membrane eliminating up to 25% of unwanted fat in those areas. It does not harm the skin cells or muscle tissue as these tissues are more resistant to controlled cooling. More than one cycle is often necessary in order to achieve the desired results, and results do vary.\\nWill Coolsculpting help me lose weight?\\nCoolSculpting is considered a long-term fat reduction technology but it’s important to note CoolSculpting not a solution for weight loss. In order to see optimal results from your treatment it’s advisable to combine CoolSculpting with a healthy diet and exercise. Typically, fat that is eliminated with CoolSculpting does not return, unless you gain weight. CoolSculpting gives an overall smoother, tighter, more toned appearance to troubled areas of the body such as muffin tops and love handles, but it will not take pounds off.\\nWhen will I see results?\\nResults from CoolSculpting can be seen as early as 4 weeks after treatment, peaking around weeks 8-12. Multiple sessions on each area are often required to get the results you’re looking for. You will need to leave about 6-8 weeks between treatments. Keep this in mind when planning for a special event or if you’re trying to get “bikini ready” for summer.\\nWhat does it feel like?\\nDuring the procedure you will experience a cold sensation for about 10 minutes followed by a feeling of numbness in the area being treated. Patients often relax during the treatment, reading, catching up on work or even taking a quick nap. When it’s finished, they are free to go about their day with essentially no downtime. Individual experiences to CoolSculpting may vary.\\nWhat areas can be treated with CoolSculpting?\\nCoolSculpting can treat a number of areas such as the abdomen, inner and outer thighs, flanks, back, arms, and the submental area or “double chin.”\\nWhat are the possible side effects from CoolSculpting?\\nPossible side effects after undergoing a CoolSculpting treatment may include (but are not limited to) redness, swelling, bruising or reduced sensation in the area. If you experience side effects they usually are not permanent and normally subside within days or weeks. As with any cosmetic procedure you should always consult with an experienced physician or technician prior to undergoing treatment to discuss the potential risks in detail.',\n",

       " {'text': 'I’m here today with my friend and longtime acquaintance, Susan Piver. We worked together years ago in the music industry. And she became an author. She’s evolved in many, many directions, and is now a Buddhist teacher. She runs the Open Heart Project, is developing what may be the largest online mindfulness community in the world. Spends her time between Boston and Austin. And how would I say, I think what inspired me, Susan, to invite you to join me on this podcast is that the most meaningful book I’ve read in relation to how to address the challenge of this pandemic is Pema Chodron’s book, When Things Fall Apart, and you’re the person who gave me that book many years ago. So, thanks for joining me and I look forward to exploring with you in these very troubled times.\\nHow does a Buddhist practitioner see and teach people who are in great disorientation and despair at a time like this pandemic that we’re all going through?\\nYeah. Well, thank you for inviting me to into the conversation, Rob. You know that I always love talking with you. I always get so much out of it. It’s an interesting time for teachers of all kinds, for Buddhist teachers, certainly. There is so much suffering, there is so much uncertainty and so much need for compassion and friendship and simply being with, which is the ultimate healing balm, is just being with each other rather than trying to solve each other’s problems.\\nHowever, there’s another thing that is interesting to explore at this moment, and actually, we have no choice but to explore it, which is the Buddhist view of the great good fortune that comes with uncertainty, that comes with not knowing what the F is going on. In a spiritual tradition, that is considered a lucky occurrence. Not an occurrence that feels good, not something that makes us all happy and chill, but a moment of absolute freshness because when we have no more game, our strategies don’t work, our hearts are broken. What we thought was going to happen is no longer happening. No more game. A space opens up and we must find a way to exist with uncertainty, which requires a continual return to the present moment, because we can’t make a plan, we can’t reflect on what happened in the past as a way of predicting what will happen in the future necessarily. And we can’t make plans for what we’re going to do because we don’t know what’s next.\\nSo the present moment is particularly alive right now. And the present moment was, which can sound trite, it’s overused, at least, is not necessarily a place of ease and relaxation. It’s a place of vital awake, vital alive. I know that’s bad English, but it’s a place where all you can do is be awake. And there’s no place to hide. That’s a weird Buddhist view of good luck.\\nI’m speaking now as an economist, 40 years of a secular religion, where people were taught to believe that technical wizards, the Silicon Valley world, would transform our society and deliver us from evil. They were magicians. We’ve been told that the market solves all the problems. We’ve been told that individuals should focus and depend on what you might call their own freedom to do whatever they want as something to cherish. And while there are elements of truth in these things, the incoherence of this society that was thought to be what you might call trusted and trusting of elites, trusting of financiers, trusting of tech wizards to bring us to that Promised Land, that place, that’s in tatters now.\\nAnd so when you talk about the value of uncertainty, I think maybe that accepting that uncertainty is of the essence in addressing the challenge. But we’re in a place now where the emperor has no clothes and a whole lot of things have broken down. Before celebrating uncertainty, I think we got to understand a little bit about the fear, what you might call losing, it’s like being at sea and losing all your navigational charts and knowing their reefs all around you that you could run aground. How do we, not stabilize on false certainty, how do we embrace the uncertainty so the things that we pursue and the things that we aspire to are more coherent, more satisfying, more reassuring?\\nYeah, that’s the question. Those are the questions. The first thing in finding a way to stabilize within instability, because the first impulse when things become unstable is to find a way to go back where you came from, and restabilize things in a recognizable way. That’s not possible right now. The answer, weirdly, is one word, which I’m happy to elaborate on, and that word is curiosity, because we may think, oh, well, okay, now some Buddhist lady said I need to find a way to become stable with an instability and enjoy uncertainty. Okay. If that is a Gambit, if we try to do that as a ploy to return to familiar shores, the ground will collapse underneath us. There’s a genuine need of really not knowing what’s going on and without an agenda for appreciating that unknowing, if that makes sense.\\nSo, we have an agenda for every word we speak, every gesture we make, every action we take. That’s how we’re raised. It’s very hard to imagine not doing those things. However, those things, attributing meaning, trying to accomplish a purpose, comes from conventional wisdom, and unconventional wisdom is called for right now. So the first thing that is interesting to experiment with is putting down conventional wisdom, and then seeing what happens. And the first thing that will happen, if you’re like me or 99.9% of everyone, is become afraid. That fear is not a problem. Giving meaning to the fear, concocting a story around the fear, trying to dispel the fear, those things are problems. But fear itself, if you look just underneath the surface, and the surface is always the story, I’m afraid because this, I’m afraid if I do that, it will go away.\\nIf we let all that go and instead tune into the sensation of fear, the feeling of fear, which is no one’s idea of a good time, by the way, nonetheless, just under the story is awakeness, wakefulness, because fear and sleepiness don’t go together. You can’t be afraid and sleepy. It’s a weird kind of wakeful quality, that if we can tap into its essence, something valuable can come of it. But if we keep trying to hide from it, explain it away, defeat it, first it’s not going to work, it’s just going to get stronger. And second and more important, we will miss the opportunity for greater wisdom than what has been conventional. And that’s what we need right now.\\nSo there is no innovation, I know these are, I’m making very dramatic statements here but these are my observations. There is no possibility of innovation without uncertainty. There is no possibility of true lasting insight without cultivating some sense of receptivity. And we live in a world that does not dig receptivity. We dig action and accomplishing and so forth, and nothing wrong with those things. But the things we really value and the things that are most needed right now, innovation, insight, wisdom, compassion, those are not things we can go out and get no matter how smart we are. Those are things that arise if we make space for them. They arise.\\nAnd so, it’s a very unwestern, I would say, way of problem solving, which is to let go of solutions. Make a space which aka, the practice of meditation, although you can do it whatever way you want. And then develop some curiosity about the experience that arises within that space, not as a conqueror, but as a shepherd. Those are really different things. Does that make sense?\\nYes. Number of things come to mind again in relation to economics. It is quite clear that the financial economics, financial theory and economics built a framework based on false certainty, meaning markets are anchored to “value” 30 years from now, and then what mathematicians called backward induction, we know what the price today is that puts you on the trajectory to get there.\\nThe deeper thinkers in economics, and I would place Frank Knight from University of Chicago and John Maynard Keynes at the head of the list, and Friedrich von Hayek a little bit also in that realm, had a notion of something called radical uncertainty. There are unknown unknowns. There is no way to know not only what the probabilities are of outcomes, but to even envision the outcomes and in some way, the things that will be churned up are based on subjective psychological expectations that will arise somewhere along the trail and will change the trail.\\nSo these advocates, Keynes wrote his first book before his famous books, was called the Treatise on Probability. Frank Knight wrote Risk, Uncertainty and Profit. And what I guess I’m pointing at is they were talking about embracing not knowing and seeing that as a structural feature of society. And what the so called rocket scientists did after 2000s, they pretended everything was a stable statistical distribution. This terminal condition in 30 years was known unknowable, and that they could show the boss, meaning the CEO at a major financial firm measures of their risk every night. So the boss could go to bed, sleep, be confident, everything was under control. And then we blew the financial system to smithereens in 2008 because it was a completely false notion.\\nI’m always attracted to a book, it’s called The Party, it’s about the Chinese Communist Party by Richard McGregor, who was a Financial Times correspondent. He wrote in the opening, I think it was a preface to the book. At around 2008 or 2009, the US Treasury Secretary, Hank Paulson and others went to meet the Chinese leaders and they said, well, emulating you guys and your Western finance, you blew us up in the early 90s in the Asia crisis, now you blew yourself up. We just got to find something different to do. I guess what I’m pointing toward is this embracing uncertainty is much more amenable to Eastern philosophy and consciousness than it is to Cartesian enlightenment consciousness.\\nAnd now, in a world, I’ll call it a G-20 world and more not a G-7 world of the white Protestant North Atlantic, we’re in a place where the basic premises on what to do and what’s right to do are really what you might call, not confused, but in the stir of different philosophical systems. And what you’re raising with the Buddhist perspective and Taoism and other things, I made a podcast two nights ago with Andrew Sheng, who’s a delightful financial regulator economists thinker based in Malaysia, has worked in Hong Kong and China. And he sounded just like you. He sounded exactly like you, I’ll send you some of his work. You’re basically raising what you might call a challenge to the creation of false certainty, which, as I mentioned in the case of finance in many contexts, by clinging to it can do an awful lot of harm.\\nWhat you just said, and I imagine what Andrew said too, which I look forward to hearing, is a very pithy perfect outline of the entire Buddhist path, which has nothing to do with religion, by the way, or beliefs or gods because Buddhism is non-theistic, so put that aside. And in the Buddhist view, as well, beliefs, interestingly, are considered obstacles, which always makes me laugh. But the entire Buddhist path is based on something called the Four Noble Truths, you probably know this.\\nAnd just extremely briefly, the first noble truth is life is suffering, which sounds like, ew. But I’m pretty sure the Buddha didn’t mean life sucks. It’s the more accurate translation of the word Duhkha is unsatisfying. It’s unsatisfying because there is no chance of creating anything permanent. Every hair on your head, every word you say, every piece of furniture you own, every dollar you have is going to go away. It’s going to come into existence, it’s going to exist for a while, and then it’s going to disappear. There’s nothing that’s exempt from the truth of impermanence. That’s the first noble truth. So now, what are you going to do with your economics? Well, that’s a question for others, but I find it fascinating.\\nAnd then the second noble truth is called the cause of suffering, which is basically pretending the first noble truth isn’t true. Its grasping is the cause of suffering. Trying to create permanent structures causes suffering. It’s interesting because the Buddhist view doesn’t say poverty causes suffering, although, of course it does. It’s not about heartbreak and loss and grief. Those things are inevitable, we can’t avoid the suffering of being human. But the real suffering is from grasping, is from exactly what you just said, trying to create false structures that actually come and collapse on us all.\\nAnd then the third noble truth is called the cessation of suffering, which means now you know the cause, you also know the cure, just stop doing that. And then the fourth noble truth is called the Eightfold Path, which you could study, right view, right intention, right speech, and so on. How do you do it is the fourth noble truth. Those things that you just said, that is the Buddhist path. You can’t create anything permanent. Now what? Now what? It’s a very interesting question. And the things that you and I were talking about earlier, the things that our culture values the most, and they are truly valuable things, excellent commerce, profound ideas and skillful leadership. Those as far as I can tell, sitting from my vantage point of my meditation cushion, those are the things that are valued by our society. And they are valuable things.\\nBut when we think that any of them is going to prevent the suffering of being human, that’s where we run into problems. If I have the right idea, if I can lead my team here, if I can have X view of how the economic picture is going to unfold, I mean, great. Please share those things with others. But they’re not going to change the truth that everything is going to dissolve. So, why is spiritual practice in the Buddhist view, at least as I’ve been trained also called a path of warriorship? Well, this is why, because it takes unbelievable courage. On good days, I can do it for 10 seconds. But it takes so much courage and so much discipline, meaning presence of mind to remain with the truth of uncertainty and still give everything you have, still find joy, still give gifts, still experience the delights of being a person. That’s our job. It’s a tall order and it takes training.\\nAnd last thing I’ll say and I’ll stop my little rant is what has heretofore been called soft skills, which always makes me really pissed off, listening, caring, working together, making space for very divergent viewpoints. Well, those are the hard things to do. And those are the things that are required right now. So I’m happy and excited for the great thinkers in our world who have been uncompromising in promoting those values, that now there’s a chance that they will be heard. That makes me very happy.\\nWell, you mentioned commerce, leadership and profound ideas, as what you might call rituals of reassurance, or there’s like a place that you can follow and calm your nerves because you know the best and the brightest or whoever are leading you there. David Halberstam’s book, the title is somewhat satirical in that the best and the brightest created a mess in Vietnam, or the notion that the financial wizards were all fine until they blew up the world in 2007 and 2008.\\nI often say that there are four, you have four noble truths, I have four tragic flaws in economics.\\nI can’t wait.\\nI envision it, I’ll say this in a context. I envision expertise as valuable, but currently expertise, trust in it and integrity is in tatters in many realms and in economics. And so, the four, how would I say, dangerous or flaws that contribute to the demise of faith in expertise. Our first, what I will call, how would I say, commission. Instead of providing a public good as an expert, you’re marketing to get paid. It’s a commodification that distorts your view because you’re pleasing those who pay you not telling the truth to a broader social audience, and with very highly concentrated wealth, this is much more dangerous phenomena because the experts are more dependent on sources of funding or a narrow group of people and views.\\nThe second, I’ll call that the error of comission. You commit an act to this misleading for selfish purpose. The error of omission is one of avoiding confrontation with issues and with power that could reverberate and affect your career, your success, your appointments, your chairs. In an elite structure, it is dangerous and smart people are often conscious of what not to say. There’s a woman who’s absolutely brilliant, a PhD in cultural anthropology from Cambridge, England. She’s been the US editor of the Financial Times and she’s on my board, named Gillian Tett. And when I started INET, I sought her advice, we had lunch one day. And she said, “Rob, it’s very simple. Study the silences because when you see what’s not said that should be under investigation, you’ll know the map of where power is and what you have to challenge.” So I would say that’s the, I will call the error of comission and the error of omission.\\nAnd then the third I would call, and we refereed to a little bit earlier, kind of the technical rituals of hiding in the monastery, pretending that acumen with mathematics and statistics is a substitute for choosing the right problems and examining and things that are important to society. And it’s a sort of a cousin to the errors of omission. If you can’t take on things without controversy but you want to demonstrate your license or your right to be viewed as an expert, these rituals of how would I say, dexterity with the tools of the trade, are a way of creating an identity. But it’s a bit of a sidebar relative to the needs of mankind.\\nAnd then the fourth gets back, the fourth, what I’ll call tragic approach to economics, gets back to what you were talking about. And I would call at some level demagoguery. But what I find fascinating, going back to your notion of ideas, leaders and commerce is that here, if you get up as an expert into a forum when people are uncertain and you say I don’t know, people find that unsatisfying. There is a demand, there is a yearning for an expert who can know.\\nAnd so, we are all complicit in this ritual society and the people who aspire to be leaders, which you might call contributing to the urge for false resolution of uncertainty. And I think that that is something that a true expert, someone with high integrity and with trust has to develop the confidence and the conviction to say, it’s a dimension of humility in the way I see it. I think that the economics profession is really going to be struggling now because I don’t want to say it misspecified but it just didn’t address many things that are now just right there, and very, very powerfully important to the quality of life all over the planet.\\nDo you remember the scene in The Wizard of Oz where Toto the dog, Dorothy the scarecrow are all watching, they’re watching the wizard smoke and everything. And Toto rolls over and he pulls the curtain, and you see the man behind working all the levers. And Dorothy walks over and he’s been unmasked, he’s not the wizard, he’s just a man. You’re not a wizard. To me, that is the parable. I showed that at my second conference as the parable of the challenge economics is facing because it’s a pretend wizard right now. And there are a lot of smart well meaning people and doing good evidence-based work. What I’ll call dogmatic tendency has really done a lot of harm to the society and to the reputation of economics.\\nI don’t know anything about economics but I agree with everything you just said nonetheless. In some way goes back to this fear and need for, a fear of uncertainty and need for certainty. And he or she or they who can ride uncertainty, that’s going to be survival of the fittest right there. Going back to the Wizard of Oz metaphor, one of the details that struck me that I hadn’t thought about till just now is that the way The Wizard was unmasked was by a playful accident. Toto wasn’t like I’m going to get you wizard, I’m going to show everyone who you are.\\nIt wasn’t an act of aggression, which would have only created aggression on the part of the wizard presumably, like, yes, I am a wizard, how dare you blah, blah, blah. But this was just sort of a playful accident where no one could deny the truth. But if it had been-\\nI would use your word. You had a word you used earlier. I would have called Toto’s exploration innocent curiosity.\\nI’m digging it, innocent curiosity. And if it had been anything else, it would have been a moment of potential warfare. But because it was just something that happened, and right now, I’m not saying we’re in a moment of playful curiosity or uncertainty, but we are in such a moment that no one anticipated was prepared for is a better way of saying it. And now what? We all see it. It’s exciting moment with a lot of potential and a lot of danger.\\nLet me talk or ask you because we’ve discussed this before, I have been trained in transcendental meditation and watched many of these, how would I say, disciplines or paths. And you’ve written about the many different paths. But the thing that you’ve raised with me in conversation before was I might call the cheapening or commodification of spiritual disciplines. There is something that’s very powerful and very deep and very helpful in making what you might call the cotton candy version that can be sold on scale and make a lot of money for an entrepreneur feels dangerous to me. It feels like it’s one of those siren songs of temptation that could take spiritual discipline off course at a time when I would say it needs to be understood by and practiced by many, many more people that have had access to it in recent years, or within my lifetime.\\nYeah. That’s one of my favorite questions to ponder. We can look at yoga as an example. Yoga’s great, no argument there. Yoga was developed as a spiritual practice and it’s still practiced as such by some but largely not. So okay, it’s still benefiting lots and lots of people, there’s no arguing there. It’s unlikely that that’s going to happen with the Buddha Dharma, I believe, that’s my opinion. [inaudible 00:31:10] live long enough to see if I’m right or wrong. I guess it’ll be some time.\\nBut one of the interesting things about Buddhism as a non-theistic tradition, is when it arrives on new shores, it blends with the dominant culture. And it not only changes the dominant culture to some small or big degree, but it itself is changed by the dominant culture, which is very interesting. So, when the Buddhism went to Japan, it mixed with the Shinto indigenous tradition and became Zen. And when it went to Tibet, it mixed with the Bon tradition and became what we know Tibetan Buddhism as.\\nAnd now it’s here. So, what is it going to mix with? Our dominant cultural values are not Judeo-Christian, I don’t think, they’re consumerist. Our culture is governed by consumerist values. So now, Buddhism, this is my view, I just want to be sure to say that again, is mixing with the consumerist culture. And if it happens as has happened in history so far, it will change the dominant culture. Not like make it into a lala land, but it will introduce some different values, let’s say at the very least. And it will be changed by the dominant culture, which is where it becomes very interesting to me. It doesn’t mean it’s going to become a cheesy New Age religion because that is not possible in my view. But there’s a meeting.\\nIn my world, the Buddhist world, there are people on one end of the spectrum who are saying let’s make a buck. Okay, good luck you people. I say. And then people on the other end of the spectrum are saying, this is precious and elite, and you’re going to have to jump through a lot of hoops and demonstrate a lot of particular forms of intelligence before I’m going to let you have it. That’s also BS. Buddhism is sometimes called the middle way, and I truly believe there is a middle way between those two ends of the spectrum. The middle way, by the way, is not the middle, but it’s some other indefinable point. That is the noble challenge for me of my life is can I find that middle way because I have to live and pay my rent, my mortgage, and all those things, blah, blah, blah. But I know that this is not, can’t be kept on a mountaintop. It’s needed and it’s important and so forth and so on. I just think it’s really interesting to see how “mindfulness” is mixing with consumer culture.\\nAnd the last thing I’ll say is, on the Buddhist path in the Tibetan traditions, which is the only place I’ve ever practiced, I’ve been Buddhist for 25 years and only in this one part of Buddhism, but you start out as you would on any spiritual path with certain practices. Practice of meditation and contemplation, and so on, and anyone can do those things. And, in my mind, almost everyone should. And then if you want to get “serious on this path,” there are other practices that are not publicly available, that you have to train first for, just like if you want to be a doctor and you take biology in high school, someone doesn’t just give you a scalpel and say go start operating on people. You have to do certain additional training and then, okay, there’s mantra practices and guru yogas and visualizations.\\nAll of these really fascinating and intense and beautiful spiritual practices that you pass through, that you pass through, that you experience. Maybe you could do them for the rest of your life if you want. And then at the end of the path, all the teachings once again, the highest teachings become completely available to everyone. Not hidden, anybody can read about them. And those teachings are called self-secret. They keep themselves a secret because unless you have a certain kind of preparation or mindset or karma or whatever you might want to call it, those teachings will not make sense to you, it will sound like gibberish.\\nThat’s a long-winded way of saying, mindfulness awareness meditation, spiritual practice in the Buddhist tradition and I’m sure other traditions too, can’t be ruined. They are self-secret. They can be misused, they can be bypassed, they can go unnoticed. But the likelihood that they’re going to be changed and lost is slim. Not saying we don’t have to try, but certainly anything is possible.\\nBut, the truth about meditation is that at some point, it becomes very difficult and also kind of boring. And anyone who says otherwise, I don’t know what they’re doing, I’d like to like to hear a little bit more about it. At that point, that’s the turning point for 90% of people. Well it’s not working for me or this is not a good practice for me or I don’t like it or my meditation is running or I’ll do something else. That’s fine. Nobody knows but you. But that moment is a critical turning point, and if you want to go further, it requires some teaching and some effort, anyway, blah, blah.\\nAm I talking to your point or am I just talking?\\nYes. I think you’re, how would I say, inside the dilemmas of how people organize themselves is maybe the word. In other words, how they cope, how they explore their anxiousness, how they explore what is authentic guidance and how they define meaning.\\nOne key point that you and I spoke about earlier but we haven’t spoken about right now is, I think, how did you describe it as we were talking before the recording started, the fancy white-ification of spiritual practice is not just an ethical dilemma, why should this just be for white people? Why does it happen that if you go to a Buddhist meditation place, almost everybody’s white, why? And how do we change that? Those are very, very, very important questions to me. But it’s not just an important question from an ethical standpoint, it’s an important question from a cultural healing standpoint because the healing of the nation, which by the way is I think what Ross just calls smoking pot, but that’s another story, will only happen, healing of the nation needs to include all of us. That’s a tall order.\\nYou could call it white-ification or Yelp-ification, I don’t know what kind of adjective to assign it. If any of you who are in the audience have read some of David Brooks studies that sort of mocked the aspiring, what I’ll call upper, lower middle, excuse me, upper class or aspiring administrative class. He talks all about the false rituals of what restaurants you eat at, what diet, what kind of yoga you do as testaments, they’re like purification rituals that are very superficial. And I sense, what you might call the status badges, it’s like a Cub Scout getting their accomplishment, or Boy Scout or Girl Scout getting their accomplishment badges, that they add all of these things to an identity that turns out to be quite superficial. And in many ways, people can be seen as not practicing what they preach.\\nI sense that in the African American community, and for that matter, in the Caribbean and Africa itself, that there is in many instances, including health crises, a much more acute sense of despair and danger. And perhaps these spiritual disciplines could be of even greater value given the adversity that these people face. But it’s a very different kind of what you might call magnetic attraction than that yelp-ification, white-ification analogy that you and I’ve talked about.\\nI won’t pretend to know how to connect, my instinct I think we talked about this is that I look at gospel music and I look at what goes on in the black church and the nature of community there, the kind of fortification, togetherness, togetherness under conditions of adversity. And I’ve wondered if what you might call the seeds of a fruitful spiritual community or a meditation practice together with others in the community, how would I say it, might have the potential to really take hold and really be beneficial. But I don’t know enough to, I haven’t lived it, I’ve observed it growing up in Detroit, which by the way, I believe perhaps until very recently, Detroit was the place that had the most places of worship per capita and per square mile of any place in the world.\\nWe may attribute that to Henry Ford who invested a lot in all the different denominations and Christian and Muslim and Judaism as a means of social stabilization at the time he was what you might call the architect of the auto industry based in Detroit. But there were churches and synagogues and temples on every corner. It’s really quite stunning even today just to see those structures. I’m very attracted, I’m doing some work right now vis-a-vis Detroit and I’d like to explore with people about whether Detroit could be what you might call a test platform. I’m working on chess in schools and other things there.\\nI remember in 1990, I think it was either CNN or ABC News said that Detroit is the cloud that hangs over belief in the American dream. Meaning until that rapid and violent decline, decline of what used to be a centerpiece of our economy, was put to bed and this society was regenerated in a healthy way as part of America that we would all suffer. I think there are some very devoted people to bringing that city back together, but I would like to explore with you how to, infuse into Detroit some of the spiritual practices that have benefited many people you work with.\\nI really appreciate how with all the places your life has taken, you remain firmly team Detroit. I really appreciate your devotion and loyalty and care for your city of origin. That’s really-\\nWell, I’m sitting here on an audio podcasts but I can make a confession, I’m wearing a hoodie that came from Chrysler Corporation, and it says imported from Detroit. Remember the famous M&M commercial that was used in the Superbowl. That’s on my back right now.\\nI rest my case.\\nOther than my audible confession, the evidence would have been hidden. But I think, Susan, it’s fascinating to me. I Started out reaching out to this young woman who I was told after being at a seminar on how to run an independent record label that I should engage with her because she had developed the accounting system for labels, master rights, mechanical, publishing, other publishing, and how to put that system software together as I was trying to move out of the, what you might call wild and wooly world of hedge funds and into running the record business. And if you don’t embrace your perspective and the perspective on uncertainty, the idea that when I walked up to the counter and asked that woman to teach me, she came to work with me, would end up on this podcast today as the Buddhist teacher I’m talking to, how would I say, you’ve got real illusions because I did not imagine that at that time.\\nAnd I’ve watched you grow, I’ve watched you build your practice. I’ve watched you work online, I’ve watched you work in writing various books. The latest one I think is called the Four Noble Truths of Love. It’s just, how would I say that, effervescent curiosity that started our friendship came from a very different place than what we’re talking about now.\\nI am so moved by what you’re saying. I’m so touched by that. And that our friendship has moved along with all those changes in both our lives is a testimony to this very wonderful meeting of the minds/friendship that we have, which is a great treasure to me. And I also would, who knew, who knew?\\nYeah. Well, all I can say to our audience is it’s quite clear to me that you practice what you preach. And that humanism and that human spirit and the way in which you have evolved yourself suggests to me that you do embrace that which you teach to others. Where is the Open Heart Project available to people who are curious? What is your website, location and so forth? How could I click on it or type it in and get there?\\nJust openheartproject.com. There’s a sign up for the newsletter right there, and I send a meditation instructional video every week, it’s 10 minute clip to anyone who signs up for that. And each meditation is preceded by a short talk. By short, I mean less than 10 minutes, on some way of applying Buddhist practice in everyday life. So the most recent one, they come out every Monday, yesterday I guess it was, was on mindful speech, which could there be anything more important right now than that? It’s my great delight to make those off of those teachings. I’d be very happy to practice together with anyone who’s listening right now.\\nExcellent. Very good. Well, how would I say, we sit astride the pandemic, who knows where we’ll be? The guidance that you give by example and in your teaching of how to embrace the uncertainty and how to evolve in a constructive direction is sorely needed. Thanks for being here today and thanks for sharing with us all.\\nIt’s been a joy.\\nFor me too. Bye, bye.',\n",

       " {'text': 'When you retire from teaching after devoting your entire career to supporting others, it’s tough not to be able to get on with living the life you dreamed of. This is Lesley’s story. She lives in Cornwall in the United Kingdom.\\n“Every joint & muscle in my body seemed to ache. Hot flushes: common menopauseal symptom but what of the aching joints & muscles?” questioned Lesley.\\nNot only am I a retired teacher, said Lesley, but I’m also a club athlete (long distance). Except for a couple of foot issues brought on by both my job and my running, I have always enjoyed full health. I also have had 2 children (now adults).\\nAfter retiring in 2017 at the age of 60, I hoped to work on getting my energy levels back up as well as improve my poor sleep pattern. Both of these things had suffered due to the long and pressurised hours of work that teaching full-time brings.\\nWhilst both these things improved slightly as I became more relaxed and had time to go on a daily run (different lengths,routes & terrain) here in our part of stunning Cornwall, my weight wasn’t shifting. I expected that as my weekly mileage steadily increased, the developing midriff bulge would steadily disappear. It didn’t! I was so confused as to why this wasn’t happening especially as hubbie and I have always eaten healthily and exercised all our adult lives.\\nOne of my two sisters, a retired nurse, and I have always been close ,so I always asked her advice on any medical issues, comparing notes our pregnancies, births & recently, the menopause. She has had a 5 year “battle” with her (female!!) GP to be referred to a consultant about her random chest pains, breathlessness & sheer exhaustion. She was told “it’s all in your mind” but the nurse in my sister said differently. So, my sister persisted and through tests was finally diagnosed with angina (of the smaller blood vessels, not the major one, as in our father’s case) which the consultant mentioned had most probably brought on by the menopause.\\nThis is what lead me to you, Wendy. My sister was exploring more information about her cardiac health and menopause. I also think that there were other influences on me thinking about my health at this life stage, asboth my parents were suffereing from health problems, and on reflection my mother was diagnosed with diabetes in her 60s, which was seen as age-related. My brother, who is 4 years younger than me was also diagnosed with diabetes 10 years ago, and is now well managed.\\nThat’s what lead me to ask myself – ‘Was I destined to follow any of these patterns?’\\nI began to think about my symptoms – some hot flushes poor sleep and most distressingly, every joint and muscle in my body seemed to ache. I knew that hot flushes were a common menopausal symptom but what of the aching joints and muscles? All I could think of was a friend and two ex- work colleagues who were suffering from fibromyalgia. Was I heading down this path too?\\nI was also beginning to feel absolutely exhausted after some runs (the length or type of run were irrelevant), feeling like I was running through treacle although the runs were at a steady pace and I had undertaken these runs for years.\\nI was recommended a physiotherapist based at the local leisure centre and she was wonderful, but I was then referred to an excellent podiatrist who had a deep interest in bio-mechanics. Between them, I was back running without pain within a few months, needing only regular check-ups and fascial release physio.\\nWith the success of this and what I was learning, it lead me to thinking about whether I find someone of equal calibre in the field of menopause. I had no idea where to start looking. Then, as if by magic, a facebook post arrived from New Zealand researcher, Wendy Sweet. It was only by chance that I saw this, so I decided to look in more detail at who Wendy was, where she was based and also how and why she had set up the MyMT programmes.\\nThe more I asked her via email, the more information I got and the information I got was exactly what I wanted. Wendy had struggled with her menopause symptoms, had got no further with her GP than being subscribed “pills & potions” that didn’t alleviate the menopause symptoms. It was only because of her career paths that allowed her to delve deep into unknown territory & come up with many answers which she has radiated out to many women all over the world. I joined the programme at the end of January this year (2020) and within 3 months of following Wendy’s advice, my midriff bulge is well on the way to disappearing. It was only 2 weeks ago that I thought, just out of interest, I would weigh myself. I had amazingly lost all my extra weight – 15 lbs (7 kgs)! My aches & pains in my joints and muscles have now virtually gone as well. If they do increase slightly, I know to get back to more stretching exercises and to make sure I’m eating ALL the correct nutrients she recommends in her programme.\\nAs a teacher, I’m alsways interested in the educational side of MyMT. Wendy is always there with sound advice and regularly releases recent and relevant research findings which are always an absolute fascinating read. I love finding out about how the menopause changes our bodies and how we can adjust to accommodate these changes. I’ve had several thoughts/queries about some niggle but before I can email Wendy for advice, she has posted an article on my exact niggle. I’m sure that she is a mind reader!\\nI have taken on a lot of Wendy’s advice and am feeling the immense benefits. My biggest boost recently came from my husband when he commented about how strong I was now running! That was a real confidence boost and added to my own reflections on how Wendy’s programmes improve our health through eating the correct foods at the correct time of day and to find the stretching exercises that work for me.\\nConfidence also comes from knowing that Wendy will give more tailored advice when it is needed and that there is a facebook community page to link with other women on the programmes. I’m so pleased that I noticed Wendy’s post and comments on facebook and will certainly be recommending her whole package to any other friends & fellow female athletes who are “struggling” with getting to grips with going through their menopausal years.”\\nLesley Wright, Cornwall, UK.\\nThere’s never been a better time to put ‘you’ first. If you feel as if you are missing out on the activities that you enjoy doing, then either come and join the MyMT™ community or take 2 hours to view my online Masterclass on Menopause, or if you can’t afford the entire 12 week programme, then don’t forget that I have my stand-alone JOINT module and a GUT HEALTH module as part of my brand new health-restoration series.\\nIf you would like to Learn more about any of the PROGRAMMES available to you, then go to the ‘Programmes’ drop-down link on the website or Click on the Learn More link below.

       " {'text': 'It seems as though March has just started, and in the 10 days we’ve had so far, two groundbreaking studies regarding HIV have been released. Last week, a Mississippi child born with HIV was deemed “functionally cured” after tests showed there was no replicating virus in the child’s system a year after ending treatment. This week, researchers at Washington University in St. Louis found that nanoparticles containing the toxin in bee venom can kill the virus.\\nHIV, which causes AIDS, is part of a classification of viruses called retroviruses. Many viruses, including retroviruses, have an RNA genome instead of a DNA genome, which is used in organisms ranging from bacteria to humans. What sets retroviruses apart is their ability to make DNA copies of their RNA and insert that into the genome of their host. From here, the virus can either go latent to hide from the immune system or use the cell’s processes to produce new viruses.\\nThese traits, combined with its rapid mutation rate, make HIV very difficult to treat, but these two developments have shown some promise. Scientists investigating the Mississippi case speculate that the success of the child’s treatment was because of the speed and intensity of the medicine. This likely prevented the virus from leaving the blood and going latent in the cells, a point at which stopping treatment would’ve resulted in a relapse.\\nIn St. Louis, it was determined that bee venom’s toxin, melittin, perforates the protective protein coating that surrounds viruses like HIV, so putting it into nanoparticles would prevent it from attacking body cells. It could then be used for treating existing infections as well as preventing future infections, whereas current treatments can only target replication processes in existing infections.\\nWhile there is currently no cure for HIV, these and further investigations may lead to a cure within our lifetime.',\n",

It was so much fun to see their very own Pet Cemetery right outside of the mansion. If you missed it, you can see more of that post here: http://wp.me/pEVbo-F1\\nThe Ryerss Museum & Library was opened to the public in 1910 under the administration of the Fairmount Park Commission. The front entrance is currently not used by the public and visitors must enter through a side entrance.\\nBefore heading back over to the 2014 Hampton Designer Showhouse (I still have several more rooms to share with you in that fabulous designer house, not to mention the phenomenal Mansion in May designer house, which I never finished sharing), I wanted you to see the inside of the wonderful Victorian Ryerss Mansion.\\nThe main visitor’s entrance to the museum and public library is from the side of the Ryerss Mansion. Grady and I were quite surprised at the industrial feel of this modified entrance, but once you make your way up the stairs and into the museum, wonderful things are in store!\\nThe main entry brings you up some stairs and into the library which was created in 1910. As an independent circulating library, it lends current fiction, popular bestsellers, nonfiction, children’s literature, classic literature and reference materials. This is the second floor of the original mansion. The walls between bedrooms were removed and beautiful Greek columns and support beams embellished with dentil moldings were added to open up the second floor of the mansion.\\nThis photo shows the children’s department, with some of the historic pet portraits displayed above the shelves. I shared detailed information about them in my last post.\\nAfter descending the stairs to the first floor of the original home, you are able to appreciate the real treats of this museum. Check out that amazing newel post light!\\nFormerly the main entrance to the home, the front parlor walls have been removed (just like the upstairs library) and the entire first floor has been made into a repository for objects collected by the Ryerss family from around the globe.\\nUnlike most house museums, the priceless objects at the Ryerss Mansion are on display in a somewhat random manner. That gold pier mirror is just amazing, isn’t it? And I’m enraptured with how the marble sculptures glow in the sunlight streaming through the floor to ceiling windows.\\nPortraits of Ryerss family members are hung on the walls and various furnishings are scattered about.\\nThis is the former dining room with it’s oval table and various pieces of tableware.\\nThis little fella is a stuffed Alligator calling card holder. He has become somewhat of a mascot at Burholme. Isn’t he amazing?!\\nA large addition was added to the back of the mansion in 1923. These rear galleries were added to display a truly vast number of objects collected by the Ryerss family over many years. This lower level houses numerous Asian objects.\\nMany of the items are displayed in custom cabinets which were fabricated at the turn of the century just for this purpose. I especially admire these octagonal, faceted displays and their Ebonized wood bases. The cases themselves are lovely pieces of furniture!\\nOn the second floor of the addition, cabinet after cabinet displays amazing artifacts. Cabinets of curiosities, like these, were also known as ‘wonder rooms’. They typically display small collections of extraordinary objects, attempting to categorize and tell stories about the wonders and oddities of the natural world and sometimes other cultures.\\nGrady, like most boys, especially enjoyed perusing some of the ancient weaponry on display. You can also appreciate some of the wonderful details of the display case in this photograph. I love the Victorian styling of these custom pieces of furniture!\\nThe objects in the cases are widely varied. For instance, this image is of an ancient lava rock and a fragment of the Coliseum in Rome. Thousands of items are labeled and on display in a typical Victorian manner.\\nAnd check out this amazing Ostrich Egg box!\\nSo if you’re ever in the Philadelphia area, planning an itinerary, I would recommend Burholme for a stop on your journey. Amazingly enough, admission is FREE (although donations are always welcome), and the staff is so nice and eager to share their knowledge. The Ryerss family history is super interesting too (there are juicy scandals, like when Robert Ryerss married his housekeeper)!\\nSo, what do you think of this Victorian Mansion, which functions like a giant Cabinet of Curiosities? It’s really a fabulous place and worth a visit! You might want to check out the museum’s own website: http://www.ryerssmuseum.org/\\nIn the meantime, don’t forget to tell everyone you know about Kristine Robinson’s Interiors…I need all the friends I can get!',\n",

With the help of an advisor, you can include language in your Will specifying what gifts are to be made to family members, friends or Fighting Blindness Canada as part of your estate plan.\\n- Charitable bequests can take many forms and often consist of cash, real property and/or securities like stocks, bonds and mutual funds. Learn more about how to donate securities.\\n- Specific/legacy bequests designate an exact dollar amount, percentage or particular asset, such as the stock of a certain company, to be donated to Fighting Blindness Canada.\\n- Residual bequests name Fighting Blindness Canada as the beneficiary of all, or a percentage of your estate after all debts, taxes, administrative expenses and specific/legacy bequests have been paid. Because this type of gift leaves a percentage rather than a fixed amount to Fighting Blindness Canada, inflation will not reduce the value of your gift.\\n- Contingent bequest take effect when you name Fighting Blindness Canada as an alternate beneficiary. Your gift is given to Fighting Blindness Canada only if other beneficiaries in your Will pass away before your passing.\\nYour legal advisor can help you prepare a Will that addresses your individuals wishes and requirements.\\nGift of retirement savings plans (RRSPs or RRIFs)\\nMaking a gift of your retirement plan savings – RRSPs (registered retirement savings plan) or RRIFs (registered retirement income funds) – can reduce the taxes on your estate and protect its value for your heirs. It also enables you to make a significant impact on the research of Fighting Blindness Canada.\\nIf you are not survived by a spouse and you have no dependent children or have already made arrangements for your dependent children, leftover retirement funds can make an excellent charitable gift because the resulting tax credit will help to make up for the taxes otherwise payable on the transfer or distribution.\\nGift of Life Insurance\\nA gift of life insurance allows you to make a significant donation to Fighting Blindness Canada at a relatively low cost while protecting the value of your estate for your heirs and possibly saving on taxes.\\n- Option 1: Name Fighting Blindness Canada as the beneficiary of a new or existing life insurance policy. Your estate will receive a tax receipt for the proceeds of the policy.\\n- Option 2: Purchase a new policy with Fighting Blindness Canada named as the owner and beneficiary. You will receive annual tax receipts for the premium payments.\\n- Option 3: Transfer ownership of a paid-up policy, with Fighting Blindness Canada named as beneficiary. You will receive a tax receipt for the current value (known as the “fair market value”).\\n- Option 4: Transfer ownership of a partially paid-up policy, with Fighting Blindness Canada named as owner and beneficiary. You will receive a tax receipt for the fair market value of the policy and annual tax receipts for the ongoing premium payments.\\nCharitable Gift Annuities\\nA charitable gift annuity (CGA) offers you a way to increase your income, reduce your taxes and make a substantial gift to Fighting Blindness Canada in support of innovative, ground-breaking research. CGAs deliver both a gift to Fighting Blindness Canada and a guaranteed income for life to you as a donor.\\nThe annuity rate (your guaranteed income) will be based on the age of each beneficiary but will often be higher than the investment return you would have otherwise received on the donated assets. In addition, a significant portion of your annuity income payments – and in some cases 100 per cent – will be payable to you, tax-free.\\nGifts of Property\\nA gift of property, also called a “gift-in-kind,” refers to donations of such tangible assets as real estate, special collections, cultural property and works of art.\\nA gift of property may be kept and used by Fighting Blindness Canada or it may be sold. The donation receipt is issued for the fair market value of the donated property as determine by appraisal. Please note that these gifts require Fighting Blindness Canada’s approval in advance of acceptance.\\nGifts of Charitable Remainder Trusts\\nA charitable remainder trust (CRT) is a deferred giving arrangement under which you would transfer property (cash, appreciated securities, or real estate) to a trustee. You (and/or other beneficiaries) would retain the right to the income from the trust either for life or a specified term of years. Fighting Blindness Canada will receive whatever remains in the trust after that specified term or after the death of the last beneficiary, whichever has been agreed to in the trust document.\\nDonors who establish a CRT will receive a generous donation receipt today for the present value of their gift (the “charitable remainder”) which Fighting Blindness Canada will receive when the trust terminates.\\n10 things you can do to create a legacy that lives on:\\n- Prepare a Will.\\n- Leave a gift in your Will to your favourite charities, such as Fighting Blindness Canada.\\n- Decide whether to leave a specific dollar amount or a percentage of your assets to your favourite charities.\\n- Consider using assets such as mutual funds, or publicly traded stocks for your legacy gift.\\n- Name Fighting Blindness Canada as a beneficiary of your RRSP, RRIF or pension plan.\\n- Name Fighting Blindness Canada as the beneficiary of an existing life insurance policy.\\n- Purchase a new life insurance policy and name Fighting Blindness Canada as the beneficiary.\\n- Honour a loved one through your legacy gift.\\n- Encourage family and friends to consider leaving a gift(s) to a charity in their Will planning.\\n- Ask your financial or estate planning advisor to include charitable giving as part of your financial plan, and to incorporate in their advice with other clients too.\\n- Charitable Bequest Language – Sample – PDF\\n- Charitable Will Bequests – PDF\\n- Charitable Remainder Trusts – PDF\\n- Gift Annuity – PDF\\n- Making gift of Life Insurance – 4 Options – PDF\\n- Real Estate – PDF\\n- Registered Assets RRSPs RRIFs – PDF\\n- Residual Interest – PDF\\n- Will Bequest Confirmation – PDF\\n- Fighting Blindness Canada Stock Donation Form\\nAnn Morrison, Director of Philanthropy\\nToll free 1.800.461.3331 ext. 232 | firstname.lastname@example.org\\nDoug Smith, Donor Relations Officer\\nToll free 1.800.461.3331 ext. 237 | email@example.com\\nLegal Name: Fighting Blindness Canada\\nCharitable Registration # 119129369 RR0001\\nTogether, let’s make a difference!\\nJoin the Fight!\\nLearn how your support is helping to bring a future without blindness into focus!

       " {'text': 'Documentation gets a bad rap. It’s a dirty word — especially at tech startups where it seems to go against every grain in our rebellious, “move fast and break things” brains. Documentation, we say to ourselves, is for historians. Everyone on my team is already aligned, we tell ourselves, so why waste time on writing it down.\\nWrong. Docs are sexy. I would go so far as to say that keen documentation is a core competency of effective product management. That’s right. As much as we PMs like to think of ourselves as \"CEOs of the product\", a large part of being successful is embracing our role as \"glorified note takers\".\\nGood doc / bad doc\\nA lot of PMs are resistant to writing docs, because they’ve been burned before. The docs they know are lifeless walls of text that sit around and collect dust. It’s easy to see why the idea of spending the time to write that kind of doc is unappealing. Not all docs have to be this way.\\nA good doc is written to be read. It’s acutely concise. A good doc is well formatted, and can be read and understood in three minutes, by anyone in the organization. It avoids jargon, and either provides business-level perspective, or links to it. A good doc takes the time to outline non-objectives and risky assumptions. It challenges the reader, and pulls out underlying disagreements for discussion.\\nA bad doc is written to be written – a checkbox on someone’s todo list. It uses sprawling sentences of vaguely agreeable sentiments, and sloppy formatting, to dissuade readers from engaging with its contents. A bad doc is written to protect the writer from dissent, and is a waste of everyone’s time.\\nThe power of a good doc\\nIf your organization has more than two other people working together, creating a culture of writing good docs is probably worth your time. There are two reasons: (1) good docs are a lightweight way to elevate decision quality, and (2) good docs allow product teams to scale.\\nGood docs elevate decision quality\\nMost PMs are optimists – they have an idea, they get excited, and then they execute. Passion is great, and execution feels productive, but it’s incredibly wasteful when the initial decision was not made with enough intentionality.\\nKicking off off a project with good doc template forces us to step back and be intentional. Even the biggest rockstar PM on your team sometimes forgets to specify non-objectives before kicking off a design cycle, sending their designer off on a goose chase. It’s the same idea behind Checklist Manifesto – why force yourself to remember a processes that could be systematized?\\nAlso, knowing that your written words will be read by others in the organization raises the bar. As the writer, knowing that you won’t be in the room when your words are interpreted by your superiors and co-workers, forces you to uncrumple your thoughts and intuitions in a highly productive way.\\nGood docs allow product teams to scale\\nPeople think very differently. It’s amazing how easy it is for a group of people to leave a meeting thinking they’re in agreement, only to discover (later) a misalignment that slows execution and erodes trust.\\nA well-written doc is like creating a hundred (super eloquent) copies of yourself. The combinatorics of 3+ stakeholders spins out of control very quickly, and even the most extroverted PM can’t expect to insert themselves into every possible conversation to make sure folks all have the same assumptions in mind.\\nGood leaders repeat themselves, and a good doc supercharges that ability. Good docs also enable efficient asynchronous communication, killing unnecessary meetings and freeing people’s time. Reading a good doc takes three minutes, and allows the reader to choose whether to invest further by commenting, or to move on to other work. Discussions within docs are contextual, efficient, and centralized. Discussions in meetings tend to be inefficient for everyone except the asker and responder.\\nHow to write good docs, and create a culture where it’s the norm\\nWriting good docs is hard, and there’s no one-right-answer. Below is an overview of how we tackle the challenge at Amplitude.\\nTemplate for the “Product one-pager” doc we we use at Amplitude. This doc aims to enforce product problem definition clarity, before a design cycle is kicked off.\\nPage limits enforce clarity. Writing a good doc should be hard. Long, winding, sentences are generally reflection of a lack of clarity. If the communication can’t effectively fit on one page, it’s a sign that the PM should probably go break down the problem some more.\\nTemplates save time. It’s a lot less work to delete a section in a template, than it is to remember to add one. It’s not condescending, it’s efficient. Having simple sections that remind the writer to start with the high-level context, and to be explicit about metrics or risky assumptions, facilitate clearer writing and decision hierarchy.\\nFormatting elevates quality. It’s like the broken windows theory where people are more likely to litter in a neighborhood with broken windows. Docs are the same way — a sloppily formatted doc makes the writer more likely to wing it. Take the time to create a template with nicely formatted sections, tables, and doc headers. It’s a one-time investment that pays dividends.\\nComment, comment, comment. There’s no better way to de-motivate your team from writing good docs than to not comment on them. Comments don’t have to be particularly insightful, they just need to demonstrate engagement, and to set an example. Ideally comments are delivered in a digital way so that others in the organization can asynchronously benefit from the discussion, but I’ve also seen the print-out-and-put-on-your-stakeholder’s-desks method work.\\nDoc types should scale according to your organization’s needs. As more stakeholders become involved in the product development process, you will need to split out communication into more docs (especially if you want to keep the one-page ‘conciseness’ requirement). Below is an overview of the docs that are currently part of Amplitude’s product development process.\\nDocs that are currently part of Amplitude’s product development process.\\nDocs docs docs. If you’re part of a similarly doc-obsessed product team, we’d love to hear from you. If you have a better alternative for enforcing product decision quality and scalability, we’d also love to hear from you.',\n",

       " {'text': 'With a flap of his White Tiger Wings, Xiang Shaoyun instantly arrived before Yun Feng.\\n\"Trash, you think just because you have a tiny bit of strength, you can stop me? Watch me. I\\'ll snap your wings off first,\" said Yun Feng as he grabbed at Xiang Shaoyun.\\nThe hand spurred the spiritual energy in the surroundings and sent it toward Xiang Shaoyun, trying to crush his pair of wings.\\n\"Do you think I\\'m still the same old me? I\\'ll kill you before you can do anything!\" Xiang Shaoyun roared. The Overlord Skyslaying Saber appeared in his hand, and he swung it at Yun Feng.\\nIt was a slash surpassing the strength of a War King, even surpassing the might of a true King. It had mustered a prowess comparable to an Emperor\\'s. One slash spurred the spiritual energy in the surroundings, causing them to converge and form a ray of light several hundred meters long that instantly arrived before Yun Feng.\\n\"Yun Feng, watch out!\" Linggu Haonan cried out.\\nBut it was too late. Yun Feng was completely looking down on Xiang Shaoyun. In his eyes, the young man was a bug that he could crush as he liked. He had made the mistake of underestimating the enemy. When Xiang Shaoyun erupted with such powerful battle prowess, he was stunned.\\n\"NO!\" He roared in fear, but he couldn\\'t avoid the attack in time. He was split into two, his blood splashing everywhere.\\nLinggu Haonan and his subordinates were stunned. Chen Jiayan, Du Xuanhao, Murong Qing, and the others were similarly stunned. They all knew what Xiang Shaoyun\\'s cultivation level was. Thus, it was inconceivable for them that he could erupt with such combat prowess.\\n\"Impossible! How can you possess such combat prowess? Zhu Jinxi, go and take him down!\" said Linggu Haonan.\\n\"Yes, commander. I will definitely take him down,\" answered Zhu Jinxi before rushing toward Xiang Shaoyun with his weapon raised.\\nUnlike the careless and arrogant Yun Feng, he utilized his full strength from the get-go and sent a boundless force crushing toward Xiang Shaoyun. Each of his attacks was strong enough to destroy mountains and rivers; no King could survive. Even ordinary Emperors would have a hard time dealing with his attack.\\n\"Hehe, it has been many years since I last fought someone. Today, you shall be my target practice,\" said Xiang Shaoyun who was suddenly sneering.\\nNext, his body flickered, and after creating a series of afterimages, he broke through the encirclement of Zhu Jinxi\\'s attacks. He arrived behind Zhu Jinxi and slashed his saber down, sending a majestic saber energy that was no weaker than Zhu Jinxi\\'s attacks.\\nThe nimbleness Xiang Shaoyun displayed was one that few people could defend against. Zhu Jinxi was given a fright. He quickly turned around and slammed his hammer down at Xiang Shaoyun.\\nFall of Meteor.\\nZhu Jinxi was showing no mercy, sending a dreadful hammer strike that was akin to a falling meteor. However, Xiang Shaoyun\\'s saber energy was extremely odd, moving at an extremely harmonious trajectory that was capable of reducing force, and it reduced the might behind Zhu Jinxi\\'s attack by more than half. It then traveled past the hammer attack and sliced at Zhu Jinxi\\'s arm.\\nNot even Zhu Jinxi\\'s Emperor-level aura could stop Xiang Shaoyun\\'s attack. Just like that, his arm was sliced off from the wrist by the Overlord Skyslaying Saber, causing blood to splash everywhere.\\nZhu Jinxi was forced to retreat while gripping his severed wrist. He had already lost his arm, so he couldn\\'t continue fighting his opponent. Without Linggu Haonan\\'s command, a few other people took the initiative to attack. They did not attack rashly. Rather, they spread around and tried to suppress Xiang Shaoyun with their auras before attacking together.\\nTheir attacks were dreadful, and not even their mounts were idling around as the mounts attacked together with their masters. The attacks filled the sky, laying waste to the entire area. Down on the ground, Liang Zhuangmin took the chance to drag Hua Honglou away.\\n\"What are you doing? Are we not staying with Shaoyun?\" asked Hua Honglou in confusion.\\n\"That was my plan. But look at his strength. He is obviously capable of escaping by himself. If we stay, we will only be his burden. Only if we leave will he be able to focus on escaping,\" Liang Zhuangmin explained.\\nAlthough Liang Zhuangmin looked like a simple-minded person, he was in truth extremely astute and could see through their current predicament clearly. Hua Honglou found herself to be in agreement, and thus they started fleeing as quickly as possible.\\nWith their strength, escaping from Linggu Haonan\\'s group was almost impossible. But Xiang Shaoyun\\'s sudden display of strength had completely pulled away their attention. And thus, the two were able to escape unopposed.\\n\"Is this young man Xiang Shaoyun? He\\'s already with the strength of a Dragon Ascension Realm cultivator! How powerful, and what a freak!\" Murong Qing cried out in astonishment.\\n\"No, this is not his actual strength. He must have used some forbidden technique or received the help of a super expert,\" said Chen Jiayan with a frown.\\n\"That\\'s right. He is likely still a peak Transformation Realm cultivator. Looks like this kid has an extraordinary background. Otherwise, there wouldn\\'t be so many Dragon Ascension Realm experts hunting him,\" said Du Xuanhao.\\nHe recalled how Xiang Shaoyun had rejected him without even thinking about it when he had offered to be his master. At that time, he believed that Xiang Shaoyun was simply an arrogant frog in a well, but now, he realized how wrong he was. This young man was no frog in a well. Rather, it was a fact that a mere Emperor was not good enough to become his master.\\n\"Ancestor, if it\\'s possible, please save Xiang Shaoyun,\" begged Chen Zilong.\\n\"Kid, have you gone mad? Do you not see what kind of person he has offended? There are at least three of them stronger than me. I am not strong enough to save him. If I try anything, the entire Chen Clan will be in jeopardy,\" said Chen Jiayan sternly.\\nWhile he talked, he shrouded their surroundings with his aura, silencing their conversation to others. He was afraid that Linggu Haonan\\'s group would overhear them. He did not think that he would be able to be their contender just because he had successfully forced them to change their mind about killing all the disciples.\\nHe could sense that apart from Linggu Haonan, there were two other cultivators whose strength he couldn\\'t tell at all. How could he offend these experts for the sake of someone unrelated to him? Disappointment covered Chen Zilong\\'s face, and he had nothing else to say.\\n\"It\\'s better if we get far away from them. We don\\'t want to be hit by the shockwave of their fight,\" suggested Murong Qing.\\nThe others agreed. They thus pulled even farther away from the battlefield. In the sky above the battlefield, Xiang Shaoyun streaked everywhere, moving like a phantom dancing amid their attacks. While he dodged, he countered with fatal attacks. Suddenly, he arrived before a sixth-stage Dragon Ascension Realm expert and swung his Overlord Skyslaying Saber at the expert\\'s stomach.Previous Chapter Next Chapter',\n",

How to open, edit, & convert OVA files by Tim Fisher General Manager, VP, Lifewire.com Tim Fisher has 30+ years\\' professional technology support experience. He writes troubleshooting content and is the General Manager of Lifewire. our editorial process Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Tim Fisher Updated on May 13, 2020 reviewed by Ryan Perian Lifewire Tech Review Board Member Ryan Perian is a certified IT specialist who holds numerous IT certifications and has 12+ years\\' experience working in the IT industry support and management positions. our review board Article reviewed on Jul 15, 2020 Ryan Perian File Types Design Cryptocurrency MS Office Windows Linux Google Drive Apps File Types Backup & Utilities View More Tweet Share Email A file with the .OVA file extension is most likely an Open Virtual Appliance file, sometimes called an Open Virtual Application file or an Open Virtualization Format Archive file. They\\'re used by virtualization programs to store various files associated with a virtual machine (VM). An Open Virtual Appliance file is stored in the Open Virtualization Format (OVF) as a TAR archive. Some of the files you might find within it include disk images (like VMDKs), an OVF descriptor XML-based text file, ISOs or other resource files, certificate files, and an MF manifest file. Since the OVF format is a standard, it can be used by a virtual machine program to export the VM data files so that it can be imported into a different application. VirtualBox, for example, can export one of its VMs to an archive package with the .OVA file extension that includes an OVF and VMDK file. OVA Files. Octava Musical Score files use the OVA file extension, too, for musical scores created with the Octava program. Score formatting options like bars, staffs, and notes are stored in the OVA file. Other technology terms use the OVA abbreviation, too, but none of them have anything to do with the file formats on this page. Some examples include Outlook Voice Access, Original Video Animation, and Office Validation Assistant. How to Open an OVA File VMware Workstation and VirtualBox are two virtualization applications that can open OVA files. Some other similar programs that support OVF include VMware\\'s OVF Tool, IBM SmartCloud, Microsoft System Center Virtual Machine Manager, and Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2). Since OVA files are archives that hold other data, you can extract the contents out or browse through them with a file unzip program like 7-Zip. Octava opens OVA files that are Octava Musical Score files. How to Convert OVA Files There\\'s little reason to convert an actual OVA file but several reasons why you might want to convert one or more files from inside the OVA archive. Keep that in mind when you\\'re deciding what format you want the virtual machine to end up as. For example, you don\\'t need to convert an OVA file to OVF or VMDK in order to get those files out of the archive. You can instead just extract it from the OVA file using one of the file unzip programs mentioned above. The same is true if you want to convert the VMDK file to Hyper-V VHD; you can\\'t just convert the OVA archive to VHD. Instead, you need to pull the VMDK file out of the OVA file and then convert the VMDK to VHD using a program like Microsoft Virtual Machine Converter. To convert an OVA file to be used with VMware Workstation is as easy as exporting the VM to an OVA file. Then, in VMware, use the File > Open menu to browse for the OVA file, and then follow the instructions in VMware Workstation to set up the new VM. If the VM program you\\'re using doesn\\'t export to an OVA file, VMware can still open other VM related content like OVF files. QCOW2 files are QEMU Copy On Write Version 2 Disk Image files that are similar to other virtual machine hard drive files. See this tutorial at Edoceo to learn how to convert the OVA file to QCOW2 for use with QEMU. You might also be looking for an OVA to ISO converter but it\\'d be more appropriate to convert the virtual hard drive files (that are inside the OVA archive) to an image format (much like the VHD example above), which is out of the scope of this article. VMware OVF Tool is a command-line tool that lets you import and export OVA files to and from other VMware products. VMware vCenter Converter works, too. Still Can\\'t Open the File? If your file isn\\'t opening with the suggestions above, double-check that you\\'re actually dealing with a file that ends with \".OVA\". This isn\\'t always the case since it\\'s easy to confuse file formats that use similarly spelled file extensions. For example, OVR and OVP are both spelled almost exactly like OVA but are instead Overlay files used with a program called The Overlay Maker. Trying to open either file format with the virtualization tools mentioned above will not get you anywhere. Similar to Octava Musical Score files are Overture Musical Score files that use the OVE file extension. It\\'d be easy to confuse these two file formats but the latter only works with the Overture application.',\n",

       " {'text': 'If you google “follow your feelings” you’ll find disparate advice.\\nSome people say you should follow your feelings, “listen to your heart” and so on.\\nOthers say that this is terrible advice. You need to think clearly, reasonably, objectively, before you act.\\nSo which is it? Are your feelings an infallible inner guide, or bound to lead you astray?\\nDifferent personality types\\nWe can find exemplars and tragic cases to illustrate either side: people who follow their feelings…and leave a trail of destruction in their wake, or those who ignore their feelings only to end up leading hollow, empty lives.\\nBut if we take seriously a personality theory like the MBTI, it quickly becomes clear that feeling and thinking play different roles in people’s personalities.\\nIn the MBTI feeling and thinking are distinct cognitive functions. Those who are “good at” thinking tend to be bad at feeling and vice-versa. But throughout the course of our lives we also tend to go through a process of embracing our weaker, “inferior” function, relying on it too much, and finally coming to accept its subordinate role in our personality.\\nSo for example, a feeling-dominant person discovers the untapped potential of their inferior thinking function and embraces it. Thinking seems mysterious and powerful, but they’re not naturally adept at it and are blind to the weaknesses and flaws in their use of it.\\nEventually they will come to realise the limitations of thinking, and return to their dominant feeling function.\\nSomeone who goes through this journey may well describe it as the discovery that they should have “followed their heart” all along. That’s because denying their feelings and pursuing their weaker thinking function was essentially a self-limiting and flawed approach to life.\\nBy the end of this journey, the individual should be more balanced and centred, and objectively happier.\\nA thinking-dominant person will go through the inverse process – embracing their inferior feeling function at some point in their early life, and pursuing it beyond its natural limits in their personality.\\nFor the thinking-dominant person, their feeling function really will lead them astray.\\nEventually they too will reach a point where the limits of feeling become clear to them, and they resolve to return to their dominant thinking function.\\nSomeone who goes through this journey may well reject the illusory wisdom of “follow your feelings”. They will reassert the merits of their thinking function. The image they project and the narrative they recount will be at odds with the feeling-dominant person, but the general shape of the journey should be analogous.\\nIf you put these two different personalities side-by-side they will describe the same kind of process of disintegration and reintegration, of abandoning and then rediscovering their strength, but they may nonetheless still argue with each other and vehemently disagree about the role of thinking versus feeling.\\nIntuition and sensing\\nThe same process should theoretically occur for people who are either intuition-dominant or sensing-dominant according to the MBTI. This dichotomy might be described as “follow your intuition” versus “stick to the facts”.\\nDepending what is called your “functional stack” both dichotomies will emerge throughout your life.\\nFor example, if your functional stack is FiNeSiTe (INFP), you’ll experience a major pull toward your inferior thinking function, and an eventual return to your dominant feeling function. But at the same time you may also experience a more muted struggle to make sense of your auxiliary intuition and your tertiary sensing functions.\\nBy contrast, an INFJ has a different functional stack: NiFeTiSe. They’ll experience a strong pull toward their inferior sensing function, distracting from or overriding their dominant intuition. At the same time they will struggle to work out the balance between their feeling and thinking functions, though on a less dramatic level than the struggle experienced by the INFP.\\nWho should you listen to?\\nThe problem is that people can make compelling cases for either side in the two dichotomies…because people generally are experiencing both sides of the struggle.\\nIf we don’t know our own personality, we can become confused about which direction we’re meant to be headed.\\nA feeling-dominant person struggling in ignorance to suppress their feeling function may find encouragement in the advice of thinking-dominant people who have overcome their struggle with inferior feeling.\\nBut that would be a mistake.\\nThe two circumstances are quite different. Feeling-dominant people will not be led astray by their feelings. Thinking-dominant people will be.\\nWhat makes these struggles even more confusing is that stress, abuse, and suffering in early life will contribute to the embrace of the inferior function as people seek out adaptive strategies to survive difficult circumstances.\\nSo some people will find that embracing their inferior function is the only way they know how to live. You might be a feeling-dominant personality, but if you feel terrible you aren’t exactly going to revel in the rediscovery of your dominant function.\\nPerhaps the best we can do is to become aware of the limitations in our inferior functions. We might enjoy using them, we might even be very good at them, but they will have serious deficiencies or blind-spots, and take significantly more energy to use than the functions that ought to come more naturally.',\n",

       " {'text': 'Collapsed. Derailed. Fell apart. Broke down. Whatever description you choose, the bottom line on the bipartisan congressional negotiations over border security isn’t good: The talks, which had appeared to be progressing toward a deal, ground to an abrupt halt over the weekend, raising the chances of another partial government shutdown at the end of the week.\\nWhat This Fight Is About: This time, the sticking point isn’t funding for President Trump’s desired border wall but Democratic demands to cap the number of Immigration and Customs Enforcement beds available to detain undocumented immigrants arrested inside the U.S., not at the border, at 16,500. Democrats are seeking that cap in exchange for allowing some money to be used for physical barriers at the border.\\nTrump responded to the breakdown in talks by lashing out at Democrats on Twitter, falsely claiming that their demand for detention limits was new: “The Democrats do not want us to detain, or send back, criminal aliens! This is a brand new demand. Crazy!”\\nDemocrats said they were pressing to limit the number of beds for detainees in Immigration and Customs Enforcement custody to make the agency focus on dangerous criminals and pull back on more sweeping deportation raids that they describe as cruel. “A cap on ICE detention beds will force the Trump Admin to prioritize deportation for criminals and people posing real security threats, not law-abiding immigrants contributing to our country,” Rep. Lucille Roybal-Allard (D-CA), one of the negotiators, tweeted. (Read more about the issue here.)\\nTrump is set to hold a rally in El Paso, Texas, Monday night, where he is expected to again try to make his case for a border wall.\\nWhat if Lawmakers Fail to Reach a Deal? Four top negotiators — House Appropriations Chairwoman Nita Lowey (D-NY), Senate Appropriations Chairman Richard Shelby (R-AL), Rep. Kay Granger (R-TX) and Sen. Patrick Leahy (D-VT) — met Monday afternoon to try to jump-start the talks and salvage an agreement. They were reportedly set to meet again this evening.\\nLawmakers have until Friday, when current stopgap funding expires, to prevent another partial government shutdown, but they were working against a Monday deadline because of procedural rules for passing legislation, including one that requires legislation be released 72 hours before it comes up for a floor vote.\\nIf the negotiators can’t reach a border security deal this week, lawmakers would need to pass another funding bill to avert a shutdown — and while the White House is open to such a bill, the two parties could still clash over the details, Politico reports.\\nHow Does This All End? The Washington Post’s Colby Itkowitz outlines four possible outcomes:\\n1. They make a deal. Nobody wants a shutdown, so the pressure to strike an agreement providing funding for border security, including some barrier money, is real.\\n2. They narrow the fight. Lawmakers could fund the rest of the government and keep negotiating over Homeland Security. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) has promoted the idea of passing full-year spending bills for all unfunded government agencies except the Department of Homeland Security Department, which could get short-term funding, The Washington Post reported. Democrats had pushed for this during the 35-day shutdown in December and January.\\n3. They buy more time. A short-term government funding bill covering all unfunded agencies would prevent a shutdown and allow negotiators to keep talking. “It’s hard to imagine anyone agreeing to this unless a deal is very, very close, and a couple of more days are needed to reach the finish line,” Itkowitz says.\\n4. Another shutdown. It’s not completely out of the question.\\nAnd what about Trump’s wall? “No matter what happens,” Itkowitz says, “Trump has strongly suggested that he will declare some kind of national emergency and move money around to put toward the construction of a border wall.”',\n",

The trauma is caused by the prosperity of infinity....which mortal being are not obliged to ever fully appreciate and should feel relieved that the lack of appreciation is not their fault........transcends us past our own material prejudices because our awareness of our appreciation is caused by mortality, not a specific object or experience.----based upon the \"invisible\"--absence brought to life----.........\\nThis page is still under construction.....\\nLive Sample of being Inside the Box',\n",

       " {'text': 'Most whole-genome scan studies of type 2 diabetes have ascertained families on affected sibpairs. Although assuring enrollment of multiplex families, this strategy may lead to the enrollment of unrepresentative families, particularly in low-risk populations where relatively few diabetics have an affected sibling. In high-risk populations such as Hispanics and Native Americans, population-based ascertainment is often possible, since the high frequency of the disease favors enrollment of multiplex families even when they are not specifically sought. The results of the first generation of genome scan studies caused concern because of a perceived lack of reproducibility. More recently, however, a number of replications have emerged, specifically on chromosomes 1q, 2q, 3q, 9p, 10q, and 11q. The MODY 1 and 3 regions on chromosome 12q and 20q have also been replicated in multiple studies. The clinical features of diabetes in these latter families, however, suggest the common form of type 2 diabetes, rather than maturity-onset diabetes of the young (MODY). Also, diabetes in these families does not appear to be caused by the classical MODY mutations. Interestingly, functional variants of the MODY 4 gene (insulin promoter factor-1) have been associated with both MODY and the common form of type 2 diabetes. Currently available linkage studies implicate relatively broad chromosomal regions, and the challenge of narrowing these regions to facilitate gene discovery remains formidable. The linkages that have been replicated thus far provide good starting points to search for functional variants in type 2 diabetes susceptibility genes.\\nCopyright 2002 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.',\n",

In May, the Group began its move to the east coast of the US in preparation for Operation Bolero, the flights over the north Atlantic to deploy the planes and pilots to bases in the UK. From mid July 1942 until November the Group flew a few limited missions to adjust to the European combat environment.\\nThe air and ground echelons of the Group moved to Africa in November, 1942 and progressed across North Africa at various bases until November, 1943 when, during the invasions of Southern France and Italy the Group operated from Sardinia and Sicily. In December 1943, the base at Salsola, Italy in the Foggia valley became the home of the Group until the spring of 1945, when they made the final WWII move to Lake Lessina, a few miles north.\\nThe following section was provided as a brief overview of the 1st Fighter Group in WWII from the 1st Fighter Wing History Office, Langley AFB, VA.',\n",

And the one person likely to benefit the most from a Klevio-enabled office is the office manager. Here’s why.\\nThe job of office manager can be a thankless one. All too often, many of the laborious but essential tasks that fall under your remit are taken for granted by colleagues prone to reacting to your efforts with the indifference of a teenager finding their clothes have been tidied and bed made every day.\\nOne specific aspect of managing an office that tends to go unappreciated is dealing with the perpetual turnover of keys and fobs for staff and contractors. At Klevio, we’ve done our bit to ease this burden by creating a smart intercom and app that removes all the hassles of key management.\\nSo, if you’re an office manager and like the idea of waving goodbye to lost keys and forgotten fobs forever, here are 5 times that you might find yourself looking to the skies and giving thanks to Klevio.\\nYour company has a hiring surge\\nThere’s no getting away from it, giving out keys and fobs to new staff can be a real pain. And never more so than when your company decides to hire a bunch of people at the same time, requiring you to get a load of new keys and fobs made up in one go. Step forward Klevio, which lets you send out digital keys to new staff directly from your phone or personalised web dashboard, without even leaving the comfort of your chair.\\nA staff member leaves amid security concerns\\nIt’s a sensitive subject, but most of us have experienced a member of staff leaving their job in controversial circumstances. This normally precipitates a rush to change passwords and avoid any risk of them sabotaging your online systems, but equally necessary is getting their office key or fob back as soon as you can – certainly before they have a chance to get a copy cut. With Klevio, you don’t have to worry about this, as you can revoke their digital keys in an instant without even having to mention it to them.\\nA delivery arrives out of hours\\nWhen you’re an office manager, it’s always a juggling act trying to schedule deliveries to come during office hours. One of the beauties of having Klevio is that you don’t need to be in the office to let people in, so if a delivery driver’s running late, there’s no need to wait around twiddling your thumbs. Just leave a note for them to call when they arrive, and you can let them in from your phone.\\nYou have to check who’s entered and when\\nSometimes an office manager is required to be a bit nosier than perhaps they’d prefer. One such occasion could be if something suspicious happens after working hours, such as a piece of equipment going missing or something being broken. With a quick glance at the time-coded Klevio event log – viewed via the Klevio app or personalised dashboard – you can work out exactly which employees were in the building at the time it may have happened.\\nA contractor needs access when the office is shut\\nIf something goes wrong at the office out of hours, it’s the office manager who’s usually on the frontline to get it sorted. And if that involves a contractor accessing the premises, it’s you who’ll need to go there to let them in. Except, of course, if you have Klevio, in which case you can let them in directly from your phone, from wherever you are.\\nDo you know any offices that might be interested in Klevio?

But not everyone was convinced. “This kind of note,” observed WaPo food scribe and Y&H alum Tim Carman, “is often just a knuckle sandwich delivered in a velvet glove — a way to soften the blow of closing a struggling restaurant.” Carman reached out to proprietor Michael Landrum for clarification. Landrum declined comment.\\nLandrum now tells Y&H the sign is no ruse: “Despite the deliberately misleading insinuations of the Washington Post, my plan to reformat the menu at East River while doing periodic, necessary repairs is on track for reopening in early to mid January—-exactly like the sign says.”\\nDuring renovations, Landrum says some 20 staffers of the shuttered restaurant have been working at his other eateries in Arlington, which the owner describes as a “real world practicum” allowing his employees to “expand their horizons and confidence in service” in a more established community. “They are growing and thriving and improving their confidence in that environment,” he says.\\nAs for what to expect from the new and improved Dix Street NE location, Landrum, true to character, is short on details. “Ray’s to the Third,” he says, referring to his recently opened steak frites joint in Arlington, “is the result and culmination of lessons learned over a decade, and the reinvigorated Ray’s at East River will be the culmination of what we’ve learned in opening Ray’s to the Third.”\\nSo, does that mean that Ray’s to the Third is a sort of preview of what to expect from the reformatted Ray’s at East River?\\n“Somewhat,” Landrum says, “and that’s one of the reasons for the timing because I wanted the Dix Street crew to be a part of the opening of Ray’s to the Third so that they could experience first-hand not just what it takes to run a great restaurant but what it takes to build a great restaurant. And that’s a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to have that timing come together.”\\nBut the term “preview,” Landrum adds, isn’t quite the right word: “Not necessarily a preview. But what we’ve learned together as a team in opening Ray’s to the Third will be applied to how we can best serve the east-of-the-river community. “\\nLogo courtesy of Ray’s the Steaks East River',\n",

       " {'text': \"Living Better with Less Energy\\nAt times, the solutions to our problems are hiding in plain sight. Sometimes the hardest part is taking the time to examine things that we assume don’t need to be examined. Consider my friends the Vetters. I’ve known the family for nearly ten years. Zak’s father, Craig Vetter, is an industrial designer and inventor who gave the motorcycle world the modern touring fairing. Craig also has a lifelong passion for doing more with less and experimented with streamlined motorcycles, not only designing them but measuring and learning the effects of streamlining. He found that doubling and even tripling their effective range was easy when the bike was enclosed in a teardrop shape! Craig understands the concepts of efficiency and has passed this knowledge on to Zak, who was preparing to install a large solar array to power their property when our paths crossed. As Zak explained it, though he had grown up seeing efficiency firsthand and how it dramatically improved the range and performance of vehicles, he had not recognized that the same thinking could be applied to houses.\\nEfficiency Improvements First\\nWhile telling me of his plans to power their ranch from the sun, I had the opportunity to propose that before building a big PV array, we look into what efficiency improvements could be made to the buildings. I explained that making the buildings efficient would not only reduce the size of the array needed, but also save roof space, along with the maintenance of whatever array was built. Additionally, having a smaller load gives one more choices in managing power outages or even considering going off-grid. At first skeptical, Zak began working through the suggestions I had for reducing the energy use of the buildings. I had proposed that if he did not change habits, he could save 50%. If he was willing to change habits, he could save 80% with basic efficiency measures, which he later told me he thought was a very tall claim. This is basic stuff for energy folks, but we are competing with big shiny objects! As an example, people think that installing an “instant” water heater will magically give them instant hot water when nothing has been done to improve the distribution system.\\nDo It Yourself\\nOne of the fun things about working with Zak is that he is self-employed and can manage his time as he wishes. Also, he’s technically adept and learns quickly, so is able to perform nearly all of the work involved in making the buildings and infrastructure perform better. We all know that much of what home performance contractors do does not require giant brains, but rather tenacity and a good tolerance for discomfort. Air sealing in tight attic spaces while avoiding roofing nail tips comes to mind. Many of the tasks are tedious and repetitive but not particularly difficult.\\nA benefit of this for Zak is that he can devote time as he has it, to continue making the property perform better even if it’s just a section of a building at a time. He doesn’t need to hire out much of the work, so saves money and scheduling headaches. Perhaps more significant is that most of the work done on his project was essentially low-skilled labor. As Zak put it, “Just about all the equipment and materials came from Home Depot and Amazon.” Most people could do this if they chose to make the time. (We probably can all find the time, but for some reason we spend it on things that are more fun than crawling around in hot, dusty, itchy attics—like drinking designer coffee and going to the movies.) Additionally, the return on investment is much faster with smaller labor costs. At present, all measures taken are paying for themselves at around 25% per year and will last for decades, while making the property more valuable. In a nutshell, Zak is investing in himself.\\nI mentioned early on that many of the solutions are right in front of us, and one way Zak learned this was to measure the energy consumption of each of the electrical appliances in the house over a ten-day period. This showed what really used the energy in his household, given his lifestyle. Zak originally felt that he could do a decent job by guessing, based on the age of the appliance and the size of the wire powering it, but was surprised to find out how little these things were related to total consumption. As he measured appliances, he found that energy usage was more closely related to the length of time the appliance ran rather than to how much power it drew instantaneously. Rarely were the nameplate data or Energy Star sticker even a remotely accurate estimate compared to the measured use or dollar cost. Once he had the actual numbers, there was no mystery about what was using the power. It became a simple matter of deciding what to replace and when (see Figure 1).\\n2014 vs. 2018 Appliance Comparison\\nIn the Vetters' case, one refrigerator and one freezer (both working as designed) were found to be responsible for the bulk of the plug loads, accounting for more power consumption than all of the remaining measured appliances combined. Here again, I had the opportunity to propose some fun solutions. Rather than replacing the units with newer versions of the same upright design, I suggested chest-style units. Their main advantage is that when you open them, virtually none of the cold air falls out of the unit, unlike their vertical counterparts. A leaky seal in a chest-style freezer won’t affect power consumption much either. Yes, modern designs have lots of storage built in, but none of them can compare to a single-chest unit in terms of energy efficiency. Zak took things a step further and found that chest-style refrigerators are not generally sold, but with a mechanical plug-in refrigerator thermostat, he could convert a chest-style freezer into a refrigerator. Also, the nature of this solution allows Zak to simply unplug the thermostat, and the refrigerator becomes a freezer again. Zak did not want to give up refrigerated space for the sake of saving energy. In the end, because the new units used so much less energy, he added a third unit to increase his storage capacity. Think living better on less! Even with the substantial gains from the other appliances replaced, the refrigeration improvements alone save more than 2,000 kWh every year. He also changed out over 500 lights to LEDs, which now give better light and far longer life.\\nBut the improvements to the Vetters’ property have not been limited to electrical appliances; they did all of their cooking and water heating with propane. One of the most effective measures was getting rid of two propane-fired water heaters, one that was installed with a 24-hour recirculation line! They were replaced with a single-tank solar water heater with an electric element in the top of the tank. The recirculating pump was also removed from the plumbing and more than 50 feet of hot-water piping cut out. With these measures, propane use has been cut by 79%. Even with those changes there are major gains still to be made cutting out possibly hundreds of feet of poorly plumbed hot-water line running willy-nilly throughout the houses.\\nAir Sealing and Insulation\\nOne of the bigger problems has been keeping warm in winter. The Vetters used to go through about four cords of wood each year. Although there is much left to be done, air sealing and insulating have reduced the yearly need for wood down to two cords. Cutting and splitting all that wood is likely a chore Zak won’t miss. All this air-sealing work has been done without the benefit of a blower door, but rather with an infrared camera, the Flir One, which makes it easy to “see” heat leaks, or heat buildup around light fixtures. I’m impressed with the technology.\\nThe Vetters have a gravity-based water supply system, and each of the five buildings served is at a different elevation below the tanks. They also live in a high-fire-risk zone, and there are no municipal hydrants within a mile of the property. They must be their own first line of defense in the event of a wildfire. The water system was built the way anyone would build it, with straight lines of buried pipe, run to the buildings and connected together with right angles . . . sometimes many right angles. Right angles can add a lot of pressure drop to piping systems, more as flow increases. In fact, Gary Klein, another energy zealot, has been measuring just how great the restrictions to flow are and has explained that done poorly, 90s can cut the maximum flow rate in half.\\nNow consider the Vetters’ scenario. They have 2-inch main lines connected to 10,000 gallons of elevated, stored water. In some cases the hydrant locations have less than 30 psi static pressure. Even the closest and most direct hydrant on the property was found to have ten 90˚ ells between it and the tank. Whether Zak is running a fire hose himself off the gravity pressure or a fire engine is pulling water from the hydrant, those ten 90s would have been there, restricting the water flow at perhaps the absolute worst time. So as repair work comes up for the water system, Zak has been correcting the plumbing to get better flow. Just between the water tanks and the closest house, Zak has removed more than 50 of those bad 90s, without even touching the pipes inside the houses! Additionally, as new piping is installed, it’s built with sweeps and long bends to maintain as much flow as possible.\\nWe even took the time to measure the internal diameters of the PVC and brass ball valves used in the plumbing to ensure that the valves were not acting as flow restrictors. Why check the valves? It says 2-inch on it so it must be 2-inch inside all the way through the valve, right? In the case of PVC valves, Zak ended up upsizing them to maintain maximum potential flow (meaning 2 ½-inch PVC valves were installed for 2-inch PVC pipe). Is this overkill? Depends on what problem you’re solving. Certainly the 1-inch lines going into the houses will never experience whatever small restrictions the slightly smaller PVC ball valves create, but for fighting a fire and getting every last bit of water possible, it certainly is reasonable to consider eliminating as much restriction as possible. As Zak pointed out (somewhat annoyed), “It’s practically the same effort to install this wrong as it is to install it right!” I’ll add that Gary Klein has found that installing hot-water systems right actually saves material and time, costing less than doing it inefficiently. A more thoughtful water line installation at the Vetters’ would have saved a load of fittings and given better flow.\\nAnother benefit of reducing the pressure drop in the supply piping is that the booster pump hardly needs to function to get decent flow now, where it used to be really noticeable if the pump didn’t come on. So there are also some energy savings to be had with better water flow.\\nThere have been a few unexpected benefits from doing this work, as you get into places one normally wouldn’t go by choice and see things you hadn’t expected. Here is a fun photo (see below). This was up under eaves behind a lot of vines. You can see the ratty teeth marks. Given enough time, they will get through pretty solid wood. No doubt the house is a bit healthier now without these “guests.” Other benefits of doing this work have been getting to visit and fix plumbing in the attic that, by itself, was more trouble than it was worth to fix. But since we were there working in the space, and presented with the opportunity to fix it, why not do so? This also allowed us to tidy up wiring before it got buried in insulation.\\nFrom Gas to Induction Cooking\\nAnother benefit worth mentioning has been in the switch from propane gas cooking to induction. There were concerns that induction cooking would fall short of what gas could do, but it’s been found that induction has at least as good control during cooking, and actually can have greater heat input than gas. It’s also safer in several ways. First, it doesn’t get so hot as to become a burn hazard, and second, it cannot leak propane gas and create an explosion risk\\nWhat can we conclude from all this? First, it’s clear that we can make our homes perform far better in a number of ways without excessive cost if we can find time to do the grunt work ourselves and if we remove the typical contractor think of “get it done to move onto the next job.” It helps to think of every part as interrelated to every other part. (Thank you, Linda Wigington!) So we see how a change here affects something over there. For example, we see how getting better water flow affects power consumption and also safety, while giving better performance. Another possible sales tool for efficiency is that we can actually help people to live more comfortable, healthier, less energy-intensive lives while saving money. Imagine how the money not spent on one asthma-related trip to the ER could be spent to do a lot of building improvement!\\nOn a more granular level, we can look at the decrease in energy consumption from electricity, propane, and wood. Just have a look at Figure 2, which shows the reductions in usage.\\nWe can look at service benefits from the work performed, such as better water flow at fixtures, more evenly heated living spaces, increased food storage space, and better and longer-lasting lighting. Then we have safety improvements, such as more water available for fire protection, healthier air from induction cooking versus gas, and the multiple health benefits of not sharing one’s living space with rats! That’s why we’re aiming to live better on less.\\n- FIRST PAGE\\n- PREVIOUS PAGE\\nEnter your comments in the box below:\\n(Please note that all comments are subject to review prior to posting.)\\nWhile we will do our best to monitor all comments and blog posts for accuracy and relevancy, Home Energy is not responsible for content posted by our readers or third parties.

       " {'text': 'Adam Schefter of ESPN reported Thursday morning that the Pittsburgh Steelers will not use the franchise tag on restricted free agent Mike Wallace should they not get him signed to a new contract in the next few days. The news comes as no surprise as the Steelers do not have the cap room to accommodate a projected $9.4 plus million franchise tag amount.\\nThe Steelers have been in talks with Wallace about trying to get a new deal done before the start of free agency and team president Art Rooney II said after the 2011 season ended that Wallace would be a priority to get resigned. It was announced on Wednesday that the contract of 14 year veteran Hines Ward would be terminated prior to March 5th and that move would mean that the Steelers have trimmed over $32 million off of their 2012 cap number since the 2011 season ended. Ralph Cindrich, the agent for linebacker James Farrior, reiterated again on Thursday that he did not like the chances of the Steelers retaining his client as well. Should Farrior indeed have his contract terminated, it would save another $2.825 million in cap money.\\nShould the Steelers not work out a deal with Wallace over the course of the next few days, the first round tender that they will place on Wallace will be roughly $2.742 million. Wallace would then be allowed to accept offer sheets from other teams once the free agency signing period begins and the Steelers will have the right of first refusal to match any offer made to Wallace or receive a first round draft as compensation from the team that signs him away. It should be reiterated that there is time to get a deal done with Wallace before having to use the first round tender.',\n",

       " {'text': 'Back to school season can be both exciting and overwhelming for your child. Here are some ideas on how you can make their transition back to school a little more smooth:\\nPrime your child in advance – Incorporate the daily use of a calendar. Put one up in their room and talk about it every day. Not only will this help prepare your child by giving them an expectation of what’s to come, but it will also help them understand temporal (time) concepts. You can use and help teach the following vocabulary: today, yesterday, tomorrow, next week, etc. This is also a great opportunity to incorporate different tense (past, present, future).\\nLet your child help shop for school supplies. Everything seems a little bit more manageable for a child when they feel like they are part of the decision-making process. Let them pick out pencils they like or a fun folder to help get them excited about going back to school.\\nPractice packing their backpack. This is a great way to incorporate back to school vocabulary and following directions. Lay out their school supplies and have them follow directions to pack their backpack. Then let them practice carrying it around the house\\nStart the back to school routine early. One of the great things about summer is that every day can look a little different. Your child may be in a camp for one week, traveling, or at the pool. A great way to help prepare your child for going back to school is to start your back to school routine in advance. Start waking your kids up when they will have to get up for school and help them through their morning routine: breakfast, getting dressed, brushing teeth, etc. Make bedtime match their school bedtime as well and again, you can practice night time routine. If your child is one who benefits from a visual schedule, incorporate one for morning and night routines. Pinterest has a handful of great examples for visuals schedules or you can ask you speech therapist to help create one that’s specific for your child.\\nYour child will operate best if they have a realistic expectation of what’s to come and hopefully by incorporating these tips into your schedule before school starts that will help.',\n",

       " {'text': 'What is that tiny bug that keeps buzzing around your eyes, nose and ears? The one that’s so annoying you think you just might lose your mind. It could be flies or mosquitoes, but this one is even smaller. If that’s the case, it may be those pesky little gnats. So, what are gnats? A closer look will help answer the question.\\nGnats 101. Gnats are small flies in the suborder Nematocera that includes midges, crane flies and mosquitoes. They are often confused with many other types of flying insects. Because of their small size, they are commonly referred to as ‟no-see-ums.” Some of the more common species include fungus gnats, black gnats, drain flies, midges, sand flies and fruit flies.\\nGnat anatomy. Gnats are considered ‟true” insects because they have three body segments (the head, thorax and abdomen), six legs and either one or two pairs of wings. Most species have long legs in comparison to the size of their body, and although they have wings, most are weak fliers. They have mouthparts that are defined by one of three categories – sucking, lapping or piercing. Some gnats bite and feed on blood, while some feed on other insects or plant material.\\nBad behavior. Like them or not, gnats serve a valuable role in nature. They are an important food source for birds, bats and other insects. Some species also pollinate flowers. On the other hand, some species spread disease and carry parasites.\\nFungus gnats. This insect is a common indoor pest that is typically found in or around over-watered potted plants. Fungus gnats are tiny flies, less than one-half of an inch in length, and are mostly black in color. They have long legs and long, thin wings. These flies thrive in temperatures of 70 to 80 degrees Fahrenheit. They reproduce in decaying organic matter that is moist and shaded.\\nDrain flies. Sometimes known as the moth fly, these insects are small, less than one-fourth of an inch in length, with a hairy body and wings that give them a ‟furry” appearance. The adults have long antennae and broad wings that are shaped like a leaf. They are usually found in bathrooms, kitchens and other damp environments. Appropriately named, these flies lay their eggs inside of sink drains. Once the eggs hatch, the larvae feed on bacteria inside the pipes where organic matter, such as hair, tends to collect.\\nMidges. These flying insects closely resemble mosquitoes. However, they have a much shorter snout and the wings are feathered on the females and bushy on the males. They are soft-bodied and range in length from one-thirty second of an inch to 1 inch. They tend to congregate in large swarms near ponds, lakes or slow moving streams. Midges are attracted to light and often found around porch lights or streetlights. The swarms can be so large that they can be a traffic hazard.\\nSand flies. Sand flies are golden, brown or gray, depending on the species. They are very small flying insects – only about one-sixteenth of an inch in length – but don’t let their small size fool you. These flies possess a painful bite that feels more like a sting. Their bite can cause redness and swelling in the affected area. Sand flies are native to tropical or subtropical regions of the world. Females have piercing mouthparts and feed on the blood of mammals. There are six species found in the United States, none of which are known to carry disease. In other parts of the world, however, they have been known to transmit a virus known as sand fly fever. This virus is similar to dengue, but is very rarely fatal.\\nBlack gnats. Although there is not an insect that is actually classified as a black gnat, many people may use this term to describe a variety of flying insects. Phorid flies, black flies and fungus gnats are just a few of the either black or dark-colored flies that could be misidentified in this way.\\nNo matter what types of gnats are bothering you, there is a solution to the problem. Call Terminix® today and let them help you find the answers.',\n",

       " {'text': '- Case report\\n- Open Access\\nMetachronous renal cell carcinoma with metastasis to the urinary bladder, and distant organs, 28 years after radical nephrectomy: a case report\\nBMC Urology volume 19, Article number: 136 (2019)\\nMetachronous renal cell carcinoma after radical nephrectomy is extremely rare. Renal cell carcinoma commonly metastasizes to distant organs. However, metastasis to the urinary bladder is very uncommon.\\nHerein, we report a case of metachronous renal cell carcinoma with metastasis to the urinary bladder, left acetabulum, left rib, lungs, thyroid, right renal vein and inferior vena cava. The patient had undergone a left-sided radical nephrectomy 28 years ago. The pathological diagnosis of a fragment of the bladder tumor was consistent with Fuhrman grade 2 clear cell renal cell carcinoma.\\nAlthough metachronous renal cell carcinoma after radical nephrectomy is rare, active surveillance should be still considered. Renal cell carcinoma has shown to unusually metastasize to the urinary bladder, a rarely reported organ of metastasis. Treatment options, such as immunotherapy, are available to patients with such metastasis and long-term survivorship can be achieved.\\nAs the third most common urological cancer and with newly reported cases arising each year due to increased usage of imaging procedures, renal cell carcinoma (RCC) proves to be a relevant adult malignancy . Although extremely rare, RCC has the ability to undergo metachronous metastasis many years after radical nephrectomy. Furthermore, RCC frequently metastasizes to distant organs. However, metastasis to the urinary bladder is extremely rare with less than 40 reported cases in literature . We present a case of metachronous RCC with metastasis to the bladder, as well as distant organs, 28 years after radical nephrectomy.\\nA 79-year-old man, who had a left-sided radical nephrectomy 28 years ago as a result of renal cell carcinoma, is presented with urinary retention for six months. Renal ultrasound revealed the right kidney to be 13.6 cm, normal echogenicity without hydronephrosis, and a mildly distended bladder. Urodynamic testing indicated obstruction.\\nThe patient returned one month later with gross hematuria. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen and pelvis revealed an intraluminal 3.7*3.2 cm mass on the right side of the urinary bladder (Fig. 1a) and a 1.7 cm lytic lesion in the left acetabulum, which was suspicious for metastatic disease (Fig. 1b). Furthermore, the right kidney demonstrated subcentimeter hypodense lesions. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the visceral pelvis showed an enhancing 2.5 cm lesion in the left superior acetabular region with disruption of the medial cortex that was consistent with metastatic disease.\\nA transurethral resection of the bladder removed a 4.2*3.5*0.6 cm single fragment of aggregate soft, tan-brown colored bladder tissue. The pathological diagnosis of a fragment of the partially necrotic bladder tumor was consistent with Fuhrman grade 2 clear cell renal cell carcinoma (Fig. 2). Bone scan showed negative findings. However, positron emission tomography computed tomography scan with fluorodeoxyglucose (PET-CT FDG) of the skull base to thighs revealed scattered hypermetabolic lytic osseous lesions in the left acetabulum, a lytic lesion in the 1st left rib, a hypermetabolic 4.4 cm right para-aortic retroperitoneal lesion, numerous subcentimeter scattered lungs nodules, and a 17 mm right thyroid nodule. Furthermore, an MRI of the abdomen revealed multiple hypoenhancing masses in the right kidney which were suspicious for renal neoplasm associated with metastatic disease (Fig. 3a). The MRI also showed a tumor thrombus in the right renal vein and inferior vena cava (Fig. 3b), and pulmonary nodules (Fig. 3c).\\nAt first, the patient decided not to undergo any systemic treatment plan as he desired to pursue the situation through a holistic approach. A few weeks later, however, the patient agreed to start chemotherapy. He was given sunitinib 12.5 mg which was later increased to 25 mg. However, he was unable to tolerate the increased sunitinib dosage due to gross hematuria. Consequently, the patient was given nivolumab through a Port-a-Cath and has remained in stable condition for over two years.\\nDiscussion and conclusions\\nMetachronous RCC after radical nephrectomy is extremely rare and reported to occur at 1.2% . Although metachronous RCC occurrence is typically 5 years post nephrectomy , rare cases show metachronous RCC occurrence after 24 years . Metachronous RCC requires patients to receive active surveillance as an independent viable option based on personal and financial grounds . Several surveillance protocols, such as routine imaging, physical examination, and laboratory testing, have been suggested as surveillance options barring aggressiveness and staging of the tumor . Furthermore, it is recommended to remain under surveillance 5–10 years post nephrectomy . However, our case suggests that surveillance for life may be necessary.\\nRCC can metastasize to many distant organs, with lungs, bones, liver and distant lymph nodes being the most common. These common sites of metastasis can be monitored and effectively treated with resection . However, RCC metastasis to the bladder is extremely rare, accounting for less than 2 % of all bladder tumors . Consequently, bladder metastasis is more challenging to treat due to its irregularity. Bladder metastasis frequently presents itself with gross hematuria. Although most patients with RCC metastasis to the bladder die within the first year of diagnosis, long-term survivorship of more than six years have been reported [8, 9]. The mechanism of RCC metastasis to the bladder remains a subject of discussion but several theories have been proposed.\\nOne theory suggests retrograde venous embolism from renal venous drainage through a tumor thrombus [8,9,10]. More specifically, Abeshouse states that a tumor thrombus found in the left renal vein, as opposed to the right renal vein, is responsible for RCC metastasis to pelvic organs since the left renal vein is the central network of venous circulation to adjacent organs [9, 10]. In our case, the patient had a tumor thrombus in the right renal vein as well as a prior left-sided radical nephrectomy. As a result, for our case, the mechanism of retrograde venous embolism through the left renal vein is unlikely to be responsible for the bladder metastasis observed.\\nAnother theory of RCC metastasis to the bladder suggests metastasis to occur through the lymphatic system, which involves the penetration and embolization of tumor cells through vascular lymphatic vessels . However, lymphatic invasion and an interconnected vascular network between the kidneys and the bladder is not observed . Therefore, RCC metastasis to the bladder through the lymphatic system is an unlikely route.\\nRaviv et al. used the term “drop metastases” to describe a fascinating theory of RCC metastasis to the bladder by direct seed implantation of cancer cells through the urinary tract [8, 9]. This route of metastasis is proposed due to the presence of tumor cells in the urine of patients with RCC metastasis to the bladder . However, the likelihood of metastasis to the urinary tract was found to be low in these patients which makes this route questionable . In addition, because our patient had systemic metastasis to distant organs, “drop metastases” may not be the suggestable metastatic route in our case.\\nAnother theory of tumor metastasis, known as hematogenous metastasis, involves tumor cells penetrating blood vessels and invading different organs through the general circulation . Since our patient had multiple sites of metastasis, including the bladder, bones, lungs, thyroid, and veins, our case suggests hematogenous metastasis to be responsible for RCC metastasis to the bladder and distant organs. The tumor thrombus observed in the patient’s right renal vein may have spread into his inferior vena cava before extending to the heart and lungs and eventually diffusing to other parts of the body through the systemic circulation . However, since there are many interconnections between these theories of metastasis, several of these routes may be responsible for the unique metastasis observed.\\nTreatment for RCC metastasis is offered on a case by case basis. For bladder lesions as a result of RCC metastasis, transurethral resection or partial cystectomy is recommended . For metastasis to other organs, systemic treatment options, such as chemotherapy and radiation therapy, should be offered. A chemotherapy option that is found to be effective in managing metastatic and metachronous RCC uses target treatment agents such as sunitinib and sorafenib. These agents provide a novel approach in managing RCC by targeting vascular endothelial and platelet-derived growth factors . Furthermore, immunotherapy, involving nivolumab or IL-2 cytokines, is also found to be effective in managing RCC.\\nMetachronous RCC after radical nephrectomy is probable, although rare, making active surveillance an important option. In addition, RCC has shown to unusually metastasize to the urinary bladder, a rarely reported organ of metastasis. Although there is no general accepted theory, several theories have been proposed to account for the unique route of metastasis to the bladder. Treatment options are available to patients with such metastasis and long-term survivorship can be achieved. Our patient is alive for more than two years after metachronous RCC with metastasis to the bladder, and other organs, under immunotherapy involving nivolumab.\\nAvailability of data and materials\\nMagnetic resonance imaging\\n- PET-CT FDG:\\nPositron emission tomography computed tomography scan with fluorodeoxyglucose\\nRenal cell carcinoma\\nChow W-H, Devesa SS, Warren JL, et al.

       " {'text': 'JNN 07 Jan 2015 LAHORE: A PML-N Punjab Assembly member has revealed that a multinational food chain, McDonalds, imported 71 tonnes of substandard meat into Pakistan and some multinational companies earned $230 million in the country and sent it abroad.\\nSpeaking in the Punjab Assembly on Friday, he protested that the government could not force close even a single outlet of any multinational food chain even for serious violation of rules, adding that those companies were not sacred cows which could not be prosecuted in Pakistan. He said billions of dollars were being made by these multinational companies here but Pakistanis did not even know what they were being served at these fast food centres.\\nHe said these companies were importing oil made from the fat of pig on the pretext of making soap from it and using it for cooking their products. In his reply, Punjab Food Minister Bilal Yasin admitted failure of the Punjab food authority and his department to tackle the serious crime of food adulteration and the use of expired products by restaurants across the province.\\nFaced with criticism over the use of expired meat imported by the chain of restaurants, Yasin confessed to the rise of dangerous adulteration of food and beverages. On the instructions of the speaker, the minister expressed his disappointment with malpractices of restaurant and factory owners in Punjab. He pointed to a restaurant located on MM Alam Road, which he claimed to have used bones for the owner’s dogs stored in the fridge along with other ingredients used by the restaurant cooks.\\nMcDonald Sale Stopped in Japan\\nMcDonald’s has stopped the sales of chicken nuggets across Japan, after a piece of vinyl was found in one nugget at a chain in northern prefecture of Aomori.\\nThe fast-food giant only stopped selling pieces that came from a Thai production facility: vinyl was found in one of the nuggets that had been made there.\\nThe Japanese branch of the food chain has been producing Chicken McNuggets at three facilities in Thailand, following the scandal with the company Shanghai Husi Food Co. which was accused of using expired meat in its food – and sending it to McDonald’s, as well as other major food chains.\\nThe nugget in question, found at an outlet in the city of Misawa, has been sent to the McDonald’s headquarters in Tokyo to be examined.\\n“We are starting to investigate how this could have happened,” a company spokeswoman has said, AFP reported.\\nThe chain stopped sales of nuggets that were produced at the Thai plant in question on the same day that the nugget was made, the spokesman said.\\nLast month, the food chain temporarily halted sales of medium and large French fries over the labor dispute at US West Coast ports. On January 5, though, the sales were resumed.\\nMc Donald and KFC using Expired Meat in China :\\nChinese branches of fast food chains, including McDonald’s and KFC, have stopped using meat from a supplier in Shanghai following allegations it sold them out of date meat.\\nAccording to Xinhua, the state-owned news agency, authorities in Shanghai have ordered the suspension of operations at Shanghai Husi Food Co.\\nReports by local media said that Husi had re-processed expired meat products.\\nMcDonald’s and KFC said they had stopped using meat from Husi.\\nIn a statement posted on its website, translated from Mandarin, the Shanghai Municipal Food and Drug Administration said it had “decided to investigate claims of the alleged use of expired raw food material production and the processing of it in food”.\\nShanghai Husi is the Chinese unit of US-based food supplier OSI Group.\\nAccording to OSI’s website, the company’s unit in China “started to provide high-quality products to McDonald’s China” in 1992.\\nThe unit began supplying Yum China in 2008. Yum China manages the KFC and Pizza Hut chains and its sales have been hit by recent health scares.\\nYum’s sales dipped after a report in 2012 said two of its suppliers were providing chickens with excessive levels of antibiotics.\\nJust as the firm was recovering from those allegations, fears of an outbreak of bird flu in the country dented its sales.\\nBenjamin Cavender from consultancy China Market Research Group, based in Shanghai said: “Yum has just started rebuilding credibility and had some decent sales which just came out for the second quarter.\\n“I think this is really going to set them back.”\\nAccording to figures from research firm Euromonitor, McDonald’s and Yum are the two leading fast food chains in China, based on sales.\\nSpeaking to Reuters a spokesperson for McDonald’s in China said: “If proven, the practices outlined in the reports are completely unacceptable to McDonald’s anywhere in the world”\\nShe added that the firm used a “few protein suppliers” in China.',\n",

So it is only fitting that we honor him in the Walt Disney Marathon Weekend Kid Races. This year is the 20th Anniversary of the Walt Disney World® Half Marathon presented by Cigna, and our first year participating. My sweet boy, Noah will hold his banner high as he crosses the finish line in his 2nd Run Disney Kid Race this January in the iconic Mickey Mouse costume pictured above. Three exceptionally talented and extremely gracious Etsians helped put this very special run costume together.\\nStrut your stuff in the hippest pair of ears around! The Mickey Ears ball cap was designed by Gina Roberts, the owner and designer for Gigi’s Flower Fancy. Roberts has been selling her handmade crafts since the 80’s and can now be found on Etsy. She has a passion for making Disney hats and other Disney paraphernalia. Using the “ear-perfection” method, Roberts is able to create stay up ears that do not sag, wilt, or flop. You can stuff em in a bag and the felt ears will pop back up every time. Customize your ball cap to your fancy by adding a bow, flower, or a monogram…get ear crazy! Perfect for a Halloween costume, day at the park, Disney weddings, and Run Disney Outfits! The cap is available in adult or child size and is easily adjusted for the perfect fit making them RUN PROOF!\\nMade in the USA for both boys and girls!\\nThe Classic Style Mickey shorts used for Noah’s run costume was designed by Cherylyn Morris owner of One Two Three Shop Boutique on Etsy. Cherylyn’s love for clothing design was stirred when she was a teen in high school nearly 20 years ago when she needed a new skirt for school. Knowing that her mother was not going to purchase a new skirt, Morris got creative and gave new life to her old one. Today, her inspiration derives from her children as she now designs storybook clothing. Her shop features an array of dresses and tops inspirited by magical characters that can be worn by your child everyday. The Mickey shorts are really to cute for words, I mean they are just perfect! Cherylyn has replicated Mickey’s classic red shorts with two large white circles (the buttons) on the front. They are made with a light, thin material allowing your young runner to stay cool in the heat of the race. The elastic waist gives an extra stretch to provide a comfortable fit.\\nThis runner costume would not be complete without Mickey’s white gloves. The gloves used in this costume were designed by Alicia of Alicia Marie Create. The gloves are made from nylon/spandex material with the tips cut off to allow for breathability while running. Detailed with three black stripes representing Mickey’s three fingers as originally designed by Walt Disney. They are perfect to complete your outfit for a Disney marathon or any costume run! If you live in a colder state you can also find thicker “Winter” gloves in Alicia’s Etsy shop. Gloves can be made in adult or child size and take up to a week to ship as they are made to order and customized to meet your needs.\\nThis costumes is perfect for your young runner and will definitely bring home the Big Cheese at any Run Disney event!\\nI am very grateful to Gina, Cherylyn, and Alicia for sharing their talent and custom designs to help put this look together.',\n",

       " {'text': 'Life is a continuous learning experience. Throughout our lives we keep rising and falling, picking up important lessons along the way. Some of these lessons come from experience, yet there are others that we learn watching others or reading in books for example. No matter how much we learn from the books there is a significant difference between practical and theoretical experience. Furthermore, there are many life lessons that we simply cannot learn until we face certain situations in our life. Most people would say that there are some lessons that come too late, catching us off-guard and unprepared.\\nThe following list unveils some of the most important lessons in life that people learn the hard way.\\n1. Walk your own path\\nPeople like to judge other people. This peer pressure can make you stray from the path you started to carve for your future. Don’t mind other people’s aspirations, don’t ever let someone else’s goals and dreams influence your vision of life. It’s your path and you decide where it takes you and how long it takes you to see it through.\\n2. Don’t hesitate when you should act\\nThere is an old Roman proverb that people often quote – “Carpe diem” – meaning “Seize the day”. More often than not, we fail to act due to lack of confidence or courage. This hesitation keeps us from moving forward and puts us in a cage of wondering what might have been. Whenever you feel it’s time to act, take action. No matter the outcome, you will end up smarter than before.\\n3. Experience what you have learned\\nNo matter how much we think we know about some topic, it’s only after we have put that knowledge into use that we get confirmation of the actual level of understanding that we possess. Sure, we could read about painting, learn all the techniques and brush types, colour palettes, etc. but only when we get in front of a canvas and start painting we put our knowledge to the test.\\nAs EduGeeksClub’s career expert, Julia Smith once wrote: “Young people often face difficulties when it comes to putting what they have learned into practice; therefore all this knowledge becomes useless when it should be the fuel that propels their careers”.\\n4. Good things don’t come easy\\nIf you want to have a good life with a successful career, emotional satisfaction, and trustworthy friends you have to work hard. Luck can take you only so far and the rest is entirely up to you, the amount of effort you put in every day, and the ability to learn from your mistakes. Don’t think for a moment that someone else is going to fight your battles with the same vigor and devotion as you would.\\n5. Never fail to try more\\nEven when we’re feeling most prepared there is a chance we fail in accomplishing our goal. An athlete could lead the entire race only to fall just in front of the finish line and lose. This doesn’t mean the athlete should stop competing; on the contrary, he would work even harder for the next competition. The results will come, eventually.\\n6. Take care of your health early\\nWhen we’re young we can push our body to its limits day after day. It seems as nothing can touch us and we are invincible. However, as we grow older all the parties, drinking, smoking, and eating fast food take a toll on our health. Start developing healthy habits while you’re still young and healthy. Take regular checkups with your doctor and dentist in order to prevent future problems.\\n7. Make every moment count\\nLife goes by faster than we think. When you’re in your twenties you think you’ll stay there forever but before you know it you are in your thirties and it’s too late for the things you wanted to do as a young person. Live your life to its full extent because life is short and we never know what tomorrow brings.\\n8. Live and let live\\nWe often try to help people when we see they’re making a mistake. This type of behavior can lead us into all kinds of troubles and misunderstandings. Don’t force your ideas onto others, let those who want your help and guidance seek you out. Sometimes it’s best to stay away and let them come to you or you might seem intrusive to others.\\n9. Be flexible with your goals\\nSometimes we feel it’s the right time to take action and put our plans in motion only to realize that we were wrong. It’s important to analyze our current position and how our activities could influence our future. Sometimes it’s better to postpone a certain goal or even change it for the time being. Accepting a promotion in a bad time could get us in more trouble than good if the time is not right.\\n10. For every action, there’s an equal opposite reaction\\nBefore you say something or act in a certain way, think about the consequences. A person could be unprepared to hear some truth or won’t respond well to our gesture, no matter how good our intentions are. Treat each word with caution.\\nTake these pieces of advice as guidance, not as a rule. Your life is your own and you know what’s best for you. However, keep in mind that morning is wiser than the evening. Enjoy life!',\n",

       " {'text': 'Baltimore Ravens wide receiver Derrick Mason unexpectedly announced his retirement Monday, ending his 12-year career a few weeks before he was expected at the team’s training camp to begin preparations for the 2009 season. There were reports that Mason was unhappy with his current contract and that may have played a role in his decision. His departure leaves a rather gaping hole at the wide receiver position for a team that was expected to make another deep run in the playoffs.\\nMason’s production far exceeded his physical abilities during his career and, although only 5’10” and 195 pounds, he was extremely durable, missing only six games during his 12 seasons in the league. More quick and shifty than actually possessing deep speed, Mason made his fair share of big plays and despite lacking height was the quintessential possession receiver.\\nNFL pundits and fantasy football prognosticators often predicted his demise, particularly when he moved from the Titans to the Ravens run-heavy offense four years ago. However, Mason, as he generally always did, proved the naysayers wrong, posting three 1,000 yard seasons during his four years in Baltimore. His loss leaves the Ravens desperately thin at wide receiver and underscores general manager Ozzie Newsome’s inability to produce players at the position during his tenure with the team. Newsome has found tremendous values at every position except wide receiver.\\nIt’s worth noting that the Ravens issued a statement indicating that Mason has not filed his retirement papers with the league. Therefore, there is a chance that he could reverse his decision and be back with the team in 2009.\\nFantasy Football Impact\\nMason’s retirement clearly vaults Mark Clayton into the role as the team’s number one receiver. Clayton isn’t a big target but he does possess deep speed and he is now a viable option as a number three wide receiver or number four with upside. Clayton has been inconsistent throughout his four-year career although his 2007 season was marred by injuries and personal issues. The 2005 1st round pick now has an opportunity to match or better his 939-yard, five touchdown performance from his second season in the league.\\nDemetrius Williams moves into the starting line-up and the perennial sleeper now becomes a viable option as your fifth or sixth fantasy wideout. Williams has size and speed but has not been able to remain healthy and missed nine games last year due to an injury to his Achilles’ tendon. During his three years in the league, Williams has missed 16 games and managed just 866 yards and three touchdowns in the 32 games that he’s appeared in. Marcus Smith, a 2008 4th round pick, moves into the third receiver role but he is considered a project and failed to catch a single pass during his rookie season.\\nQuarterback Joe Flacco clearly takes a hit with the loss of Mason, who was his security blanket at receiver and the team’s top option in the passing game on third down. At this point in their careers, both Clayton and Williams are better deep threats than crafty route runners so that will likely mean more targets for the team’s tight ends and running backs. My revised QB rankings, published just prior to this news, had Flacco as the 24th ranked fantasy quarterback and he will move down barring a move by the team that bolsters their wide receiver depth chart.\\nL.J. Smith apparently has the inside track to become the team’s starting tight end ahead of Todd Heap and both players figure to benefit from Mason’s departure. However, neither should be considered anything more than low end backups for fantasy purposes. Ray Rice figures to be the team’s top receiving threat at running back and he will likely pick up some of the slack in the passing game.\\nAll of the above is prefaced on the assumption the team’s depth chart remains as currently stands which could be a poor assumption to make. The Ravens have made noises about acquiring Anquan Boldin from Arizona and may also have interest in the Broncos’ Brandon Marshall or free agent Plaxico Burress. The Browns’ Braylon Edwards could be available but they will not trade him to a team in their division.',\n",

       " {'text': 'TIME TRAVEL: WiseTwo\\nCircle Art Gallery, 26 September – 16 October 2018\\nAustralia, Canada, Colombia, France, Malaysia, Mexico, Rwanda, Singapore, South Africa, the United States of America, Tunisia and Kenya. In each of these countries, street artist and muralist, WiseTwo has created work in public spaces, and in each of these cities he has found himself one among a community of storytellers, many of them itinerant, whose work is nurtured within the full glare of the public. As with other types of art, street art and graffiti attempt to narrate our lives and experiences. The public nature of their work – its life and afterlife – further speaks to the need to leave something of oneself in whichever space one has occupied – to claim that at a point in time, recently, or in the distant past, someone was present, alive and made his or her mark.\\nThe above claims are, of course, grand and loaded and one could be forgiven for expecting to encounter sweeping historical narratives or political commentary in the work of WiseTwo. Not so. Deliberately avoiding compositions that insist on singular, linear narratives, he approaches his works as the beginning of a journey for his audience, a means to find their way back to themselves.\\nNumerous influences pervade the work of WiseTwo – both overtly and more subtly. From the iconography of the Ethiopian Orthodox church, to the mythology of Meso- American communities (the Aztecs are one of his current\\npreoccupations), by way of the hieroglyphs of ancient Egypt, WiseTwo is an excavator of symbols and language. This wealth of references is not always apparent as one looks at his work. All these and more, are parsed and redeployed as part of an intricate system of patterns and symbols.\\nHis compositions, often large-scale portraits in which a mask occupies a central position, rely on geometric patterning and symbols, and a controlled colour palette. The densely packed compositions invite the viewer to go on a kind of cognitive adventure, the multiplicity of references igniting associations that range from the minute to the grand.\\nTwo symbols to which he returns regularly are trees and masks: The trees hint at the vicissitudes of life, cycles of bounty and scarcity, beginnings and ends, life and death. The masks, in turn, appear, both as disguises and talismans. On the one hand, WiseTwo treats these masks as a metaphor for the identities that we take on, shifting and substituting one for another as we move through the world. On the other hand, he draws on the histories of masks as objects of utilitarian, aesthetic, and spiritual value, they are treated here as conduits through which we are able to access other modes of being, different psychic spaces.\\nWiseTwo’s work has found an audience in countries where muralism and graffiti are part and parcel of the urban landscape. Often countries with a socialist history or a history of revolution, where this kind of art is taken seriously and street artists treated with respect. His most recent sojourn was to Mexico, home of the great Mexican muralists whom he counts among his influences, he created work in multiple sites. His work has also taken him to over ten countries as far away as Adelaide in Australia and to Paris where he had his first solo exhibition.\\n‘Time Travel’ at Circle Art Gallery is his first ever exhibition in Kenya, where he began his career creating artwork in estates such as Jericho and Maringo before taking on a hotel in upmarket Westlands. In this exhibition, WiseTwo invites us into his world, a realm of myth and fantasy, where his compositions take us on a journey through geography and time, offering glimpses into cultures outside our own.\\nDon Handa, September 2018',\n",

       " {'text': 'Four more days in SPB, in Krestovskiy Marina. It is the usual with not terribly clean facilities and no water to bunker. But it had shore power and friendly marina people. It’s a tad far from the centre but so is any other marina here. At least it is quiet unlike the opposite River Marina. The closest restaurant, called Sunday, is next to the marina and the food is good. You’ll like especially it if you are into bling and cosmetic surgery.\\nFirst Bridget left for home, then Dirk too. Iain would stay on for the sailing to Tallinn. He even went shopping to make us a stew that would keep us going during our 175-ish nm. Wonderful to have crew with initiative and energy. In the meantime I had my laptop repaired which had packed in just as we were to leave Priozersk. Typical! The engine still needed servicing and so there were a few more things to do before we could leave.\\nVladimir Ivankiv – our agent – dropped in for a chat. Was good to seeing him again. I mentioned that I would not mind to crew on boats that go through the Russian waterways. I don’t want to do more of it on my own boat. Skippering and tourleadering was perhaps a bit much.\\nLast evening for our departure, Russian Sergey arrived from Finland on his very well kitted out motor-sailor. Not my type of boat but you’ll be warm and comfortable in a gale. I think our pilot would agree. So many Russians winter their boat in Finland. Clearly they have never been to the great city of Priozersk. But if you insist on a heated hangar for your boat…..\\nChecking out of Russia (in Kronshtadt) was painless. They do go through the boat with cameras and film everything. As they did when we arrived last year. But all in a friendly and courteous manner. We were done in 30 minutes. Unlike in Azov, all those years ago.\\nOur sailing to Tallinn was both stormy and foggy. I might now finally remember what 20 m/s is in knots. Arriving in Tallinn in the dark was rather special. We had to wait for a ferry before we could go in. The ferry arrived as a spooky apparition out of the fog. The fog though was no match though for the bright harbour lights',\n",

       " {'text': 'Allah says in the Qur’an,\\nMen are caretakers (qawwamuna) of women, because of that through which Allah has favored one over another, and because of what they spend of their property (Qur’an 4:34).\\nBefore trying to understand this in a knowledge-based way, it is worth remembering that the Qur’an severely blames whoever would speak on religious matters without knowledge, as Allah says in surat al-Najm,\\nThey have no knowledge of it whatsoever: they but follow opinion, and opinion avails nothing in place of the Truth (Qur’an 53:28).\\nAlthough originally revealed about unbelievers who gave the angels names, this verses concluding note is a cogent reminder until the end of time that we must make sure of what we say about religion. For this reason, my advice, to myself and to every Muslim, is that when seeking knowledge on any question in Islam, one should rely on the top scholars in the field that deals with the question; in this case, the Imams of tafsir or Qur’anic exegesis.\\nThis is more necessary today than ever, when so much Islamic thought abounds and so little of what in previous centuries of Islamic learning was called ilm or “knowledge”. The good news reaches us that some academic celebrity or other has become a Muslim, only to be followed a few months later by the bad news: that he has written a new book about Islam. The knowledge of Islam, encompassing the entire ethical range of human experience, this world and the next, has never been considered attainable without learning it from those who have a working familiarity with it, the traditional ulama. It was once said to Imam Abu Hanifa, “In such and such a mosque there is a circle that discusses fiqh (lit. the “understanding of fine points of the religion”)”. He asked, “Do they have a master over them?” and they said no. He said, “They will never understand” (Ibn Muflih, al-Adab al-shariyya wa al-minah al-mariyya. 3 vols. Cairo n.d. Reprint. Cairo: Maktaba Ibn Taymiya, 1398/1978, 3.374).\\nIt is true that if such a celebrity confines himself to description of some particular Islamic phenomenon in ways he has been previously trained to, there is perhaps no harm in it. But when he tries an ethical analysis of what the Qur’an (or hadith) tells Muslims to do, he has passed into explaining the command of Allah, and in such a case, if he does not know the interpretive dimensions of that command–the aspects of Arabic, the figurative, the literal, the types of metaphor, the context in which various verses were revealed, which verses supersede others and which are superseded, the points on which there is scholarly consensus (ijma) and the points on which there is not, the tenets of faith of Ahl al-Sunna, and a great deal more–he will fail.\\nInterpreting the word qawwamuna in the above verse is just such an ethical analysis, with human implications too tremendous to be left to amateurs. We will therefore turn to what some of the principle Imams of tafsir or Qur’anic exegesis have said about it. One of the earliest tafsirs in print is by Imam Ibn Jarir al-Tabari (d. 310/923), who says:\\nAllah, majestic be His praise, means by Men are caretakers of women that they are in charge of their womenfolk, in disciplining and guidance, respecting the rights that they [women] owe to Allah and to them. Because of that by which Allah has favored one over another means because of that through which Allah has favored men over their wives, since men must give them their marriage payment (mahr) and spend of their wealth to support them, and save them their pains and effort: that is the favoring of Allah Most Blessed and Exalted of men over women, and is why they have become caretakers of them who have authority over them regarding those of their affairs that Allah has given them charge of … (Jami al-bayan an tawil ay al-Qur’an. 30 vols. Cairo n.d. Reprint (30 vols. in 15). Beirut: Dar al-Fikr, 1405/1984, 5.57).\\nAl-Tabari then mentions the chains of narrators that transmit the above exegesis from some of the earliest scholars, such as Ibn Abbas (d. 68/ 687), al-Dahhak (d. A.H. 102), al-Suddi (d. A.H. 127), and Sufyan al-Thawri (d. 161/778). Then he mentions, with a chain of transmission that ends with Hasan al-Basri (d. 110/728) that a man slapped his wife, and she went to the Prophet (Allah bless him and give him peace), who wanted to let her take retaliation (qisas) against her husband [by striking him back in reprisal], but Allah revealed Men are caretakers qawwamuna) of women, because of that through which Allah has favored one over another, and because of what they spend of their property, so the Prophet (Allah bless him and give him peace) summoned the man, recited the verse to him and said, “I wanted one thing, but Allah wanted another” (ibid., 58).\\nIn fact, although the hadith scholar Imam al-Baghawi (d. 510/1117) also mentions this event in his Maalim al-Tanzil, neither he nor al-Tabari can produce an acceptable chain of transmission of it back to the Prophet (Allah bless him and give him peace), so for religious purposes, it is not well-documented enough to rely on for the verses interpretation, and al-Tabari’s first interpretation is sounder.\\nBut whatever the sabab al-nuzul or “original occasion of revelation” of the verse, the intended meaning is not confined to that alone. As the Yemeni shari’a scholar and judge Abdullah Mahfuz Baalawi says, “The interpretive principle established by the scholarly consensus (ijma) of specialists in methodological bases (usul) of Sacred Law is that the point of primary texts [of the Qur’an and sunna] lies in the generality of their lexical significance, not the specificity pf their historical context [emphasis mine] (al-Sunna wa al-bid’a. Kuwait: Matabi al-Wazzan, 1404/1984, 33).\\nIn light of this important principle, the exegetes we will now examine adduce the significance of this verses placement in the Qur’an (for the order is also divinely revealed), coming as it does after the provisions for Islamic estate division (irth) in surat al-Nisa. The Arabic grammarian and exegete Abu Hayyan al-Nahwi (d. 754/1353) says of the verse “Men are caretakers of women”:\\nBecause Allah Most High has mentioned [in preceding verses] the matter of men and women acquiring their appointed share and their estate-division inheritance, He [here] apprises them that men are in charge of the interests of women. Caretakers (qawwamuna) is an intensive form [indicating something done much]. Because Allah has favored one over another means “because of Allah’s favoring some men over others, this man having been given more sustenance (rizq) than that man, this man being better off than that one”. And because they spend of their property means “upon women”. The word ma [lit. what, translated above in the citation of al-Tabari as “because of that through which Allah has favored,” and secondly, “because of what they spend”] is [rather] ma masdariyya or “the indefinite pronoun signifying a verbal noun” in both instances. [Thus meaning “because of Allah’s favoring the one,” and “because of their spending of their property,”] (Tafsir al-nahr al-madd min al-Bahr al-muhit. 2 vols. in 3. Beirut: Dar al-Janan and Mu’assasa al-Kutub al-Thaqafiyya, 1407/1987, 1.45758).\\nImam Fakhr al-Din al-Razi is another exegete who considers the relation of the verse “Men are caretakers of women” to other verses: Know that Allah Most High has said [two verses previously], “. . . and not to long for that with which Allah has preferred some of you above others” (Qur’an 4:32), a verse that we said was revealed because some women made remarks about Allah’s favoring men over them in estate division inheritance [by certain male heirs receiving twice the share of their female counterparts]. So Allah mentions in this verse that He only favored men over women in estate division because men are the caretakers of women. For although both spouses enjoy the usufruct of each others person, Allah has ordered men to pay women their marriage portion, and to daily provide them with their support, so that the increase on one side is met with an increase on the other–and so it is as though there is no favoring at all. This clarifies the verses arrangement and order (Tafsir al-Fakhr al-Razi. 32 vols. Beirut 1401/1981. Reprint (32 vols. in 16). Beirut: Dar al-Fikr, 1405/1985, 10.90).\\nFinally, the more fiqh-oriented exegesis of al-Kaya al-Harrasi notes that while Allah has mentioned men’s support of women in verses such as the one in surat al-Tahrim “Let him who possesses plenty spend of his plenty; and let him whose provision is straitened spend of what Allah has given him” (Qur’an 65:7), in this verse [Men are caretakers (qawwamuna) of women], He mentions the necessary cause (`illa) for this support, so scholars have naturally inferred from the two verses taken together that whenever a husband is unable to support his wife, he is no longer her caretaker: she is not obliged to remain at home [should he request it] in any school of jurisprudence, and according to the school of al-Shafi’i (Allah be well pleased with him), she is entitled to have the marriage annulled. He is no longer a caretaker or entitled to oblige her to remain at home because he has vitiated the objective of protecting her by marriage, for the aim of marriage is her security (Ahkam al-Qur’an. 4 vols. Cairo n.d. Reprint (4 vols. in 2). Beirut: Dar al-Kutub al-Ilmiyya, 1405/1985, 2.449).\\nIn answer to your question then, our exegetes clarify how the meaning of qawwamuna or “caretakers” involves legal rights and obligations on the part of both men and women. It entails that women have the right to security, protection, and to be free from the thought of having to support themselves. Even if a woman has millions, she is entitled to be completely supported by her husband and can have her marriage annulled if he is unable to. And it entails that a man has charge of his wife’s interests, supervision, and discipline. And Allah knows best.\\n©Nuh Ha Mim Keller 1995',\n",

       " {'text': 'The use of the herb plantain in dairy farm pastures – likened to giving \"lollies\" to cows – has been shown in one test to reduce nitrate leaching by up to 90 per cent.\\nNew research by a Massey University-led team has shown that incorporating the plant in a cow\\'s diet could significantly help reduce the amount of nitrate leaching into New Zealand\\'s waterways.\\nMany farms are already applying management practices that reduce nitrate run off, but these studies give farmers more options and tools.\\nAn initial trial, run over two months last year in the Tararua district of the Manwatu-Wanganui region, recorded a drop in nitrate leaching of 90 per cent. A follow up test, held over a longer nine-month period, resulted in a reduction of 66 per cent.\\nA researcher involved in the project, Soledad Navarrete, a post-doctoral fellow at the university, says the first tests, which took place in March and April 2017, \"suggested plantain had the potential to reduce nitrate leaching by 90 per cent through a lower concentration of nitrate in a cow\\'s urine.\"\\nSubsequent testing between September 2017 and June this year also showed significant gains resulting in the 66 per cent drop.\\nNavarrete put the variability between trials down to the fact the first tests were carried out before winter in 2017 - a time when nitrate leaching is high - while the second trial was undertaken over a longer period.\\nBut Navarrete says many more questions need to be answered before scientists will feel confident in recommending its widespread use on New Zealand dairy farms: \"We need to better understand what proportion of plantain is necessary in the sward [pasture] to provide the greater impact; the testing we are planning in next year\\'s grazing season ought to give us this.\"\\nThe Massey research is one of a number of plantain studies taking place around the world. In Tasmania, the leader of a project on dairy farms there, Adam Langworthy, says the crop is not only nutritious, it is also extremely palatable.\\n\"For the cows, it\\'s like having lollies sprinkled through the paddock,\" he says. \"It helps to increase their consumption as they eat more pasture while searching for the plantain.\"\\nThe Tasmanian project, which is partly funded by Dairy Australia, is, like the Massey trial, looking to establish the optimal sowing methods and rate of coverage of the crop per hectare.\\nAnd in the Netherlands a scientific article written by the plant sciences department at Wageningen University says including herbs like plantain in pastures has been shown to not only reduce nitrate leaching, but to reduce methane emissions by livestock.\\nPlantain works in several ways to reduce nitrogen leaching. Its high water content means a cow\\'s urine is more diluted enabling the nitrate to spread over a greater area of pasture, the nitrogen eaten is proportioned differently in an animal\\'s body so less makes it into the urine and mechanisms within the crop\\'s root system locks more of the nitrate up in the soil.\\nNavarrete says three pastures were used in the Massey trial each with different mixes – plantain only, a plantain-clover mix and ryegrass-white clover. Sixty cows grazed in each over eight consecutive days. The proportion of plantain used was 85 per cent (plantain only) and 65 per cent (plantain-clover mix).\\nResearchers measured pasture production, the nitrous oxide loss from the pasture and the nitrogen content in animal urine, faeces, blood and milk. During winter 2017 drainage water was collected and analysed.\\n\"These results demonstrated large reductions in nitrate leaching,\" Navarrete says. \"The study showed that plantain decreases the urinary nitrate and urea concentration of cows when compared to cows fed ryegrass. The incorporation of plantain in a cow\\'s diet appeared to reduce the nitrate leaching.\"\\nNavarrete says the next step is to determine how much plantain an animal should be eating. To test this, the Massey team is preparing pastures for grazing next year by varying the proportion of plantain in each. It has yet to decide on the proportions but Navarrete says it will possibly be at levels of 20, 40 and 60 per cent.\\nNitrate can have damaging effects on the health of waterways. Significant amounts can lead to excessive algal and aquatic plant growth which, by depleting water of oxygen or changing habitat, can reduce the number of sensitive species living in that waterway.\\nIt has also been associated with toxic blooms in lakes, allowing invasive weeds to thrive and impact human recreation in rivers.\\nThe Massey study is running at the same time as a farmer-led initiative in Tararua in which DairyNZ is working with 21 farmers to see if the results translate to larger catchment scale.',\n",

       " {'text': \"For the past several years, Wordcraft has been researching and focusing efforts on closing the literacy gap among Native American youth. Our idea has been to establish a new model of literacy that focuses on synthesizing Indigenous and Western knowledge and leads to stronger student accomplishments in reading, writing, and communicating. Rather than punishing students who have trouble with reading and writing, we are looking to draw upon our traditional values in order to draw upon the strengths of Native knowledge and Native communities in addressing these significant issues for Native students.\\nTo this end, the Native Youth Literacy Project will look to develop a new system of literacy with a new approach to assessing individual capacity and competence, one that draws upon traditional Indigenous values and contextual relations in order to promote reading and writing, while at the same time, strengthening traditional systems of knowledge transference and honoring different concepts of literacy, including in the areas of language retention and communication.\\nWe hope to complete the first phase of this work by the end of 2015 and will continue to post updates on this website. If you have interest in discussing this work, please contact: email@example.com\\nfor more information.\\nWordcraft Circle is looking to provide a permanent home for the incredible stories of our Indigenous communities.\\nToo often, we have stories which have been recorded but now collect dust beneath the bed or shelved in archives where no one has access. Our stories are too important to be left to these fates. These stories must be heard in order to live!\\nThe Electric Tellings Project will ensure that the stories continue and always have a location for current and future generations to listen and learn from the knowledge of our elders, our ancestors and ourselves.\\nOur goal is to collect as many stories as we are able in order to create an online repository and digital radio station which will broadcast these stories 24/7.\\nIf you are interested in helping us with this project or donating time or resources, please contact: firstname.lastname@example.org.\\nFor thousands of years Indigenous people have shared their knowledge, traditions, and values through the use of story. Sacred stories, heroic stories, historical and narrative stories, all formed the basis of how the People were supposed to exist in ways that promoted sustainability and longevity. As Western values and knowledge structures were introduced, it was the stories that held the People together during the missionary and boarding school eras.\\nYet, Western education systems find no value in models that do not serve to reinforce the dominant hegemony. Therefore storytelling is often disregarded in favor of a mastery over reading and writing.\\nThe Story Keepers project seeks to draw upon the traditional Indigenous ways of being and knowing as a way of providing a cultural grounding and reframing for literacy efforts in Native and Indigenous communities. By utilizing the name of Story Keeper, we are highlighting the important role that each of the participants will have in keeping and maintaining the stories of their People.\\nThe goals for the project are as follows:\\nTo empower Native and Indigenous youth and communities through deep cultural and traditional connections to become guides and guardians of their communities' traditional values and ways of being as communicated through traditional and contemporary stories\\nTo support the development of strong communication skills based on Indigenous traditions of storytelling and oratory\\nTo develop a new metric for determining literacy from a Pueblo Indigenous perspective\\nTo promote intellectual curiosity and Indigenous imagination through the use of traditional Indigenous learning methodologies\\nIf you are interested in assisting with the Story Keepers project or wish to host the project at your school or community, please use the link below.\\nOver the next year, Wordcraft will be offering a number of genre-based digital workshops to help support writers interested in developing their craft and advancing their career aspirations. Workshops will be both individual and series-based and will have a supporting cost. Scholarships and fiscal support for workshops will be available.\\nUse the link below to add your email to our workshop listing when they become available later in the year.\",\n",

Current video alignment methods usually deal with a relatively simple case of fixed or rigidly attached cameras or simultaneous acquisition. Therefore, in this paper we propose a joint video alignment for bringing two video sequences into a spatio-temporal alignment. Specifically, the novelty of the paper is to formulate the video alignment to fold the spatial and temporal alignment into a single alignment framework. This simultaneously satisfies a frame-correspondence and frame-alignment similarity; exploiting the knowledge among neighbor frames by a standard pairwise Markov random field (MRF). This new formulation is able to handle the alignment of sequences recorded at different times by independent moving cameras that follows a similar trajectory, and also generalizes the particular cases that of fixed geometric transformation and/or linear temporal mapping. We conduct experiments on different scenarios such as sequences recorded simultaneously or by moving cameras to validate the robustness of the proposed approach. The proposed method provides the highest video alignment accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art methods on sequences recorded from vehicles driving along the same track at different times.',\n",

The South Korean Joint Chiefs of Staff warned of retaliation against additional provocations. And less than two weeks after the South Korean president predicted that there would be no war on the Korean Peninsula, he urged his military leaders to “meet the requirements of modern warfare so that [the military] can quickly switch to an offensive posture in case North Korea stages a provocation.” The U.S. military detected three missile launches; one of which exploded early in the launch phase. The Chinese government described Monday’s missile tests as a “tipping point” for the region. This is the most serious provocation yet and the fact that the South Korean president has changed his tune regarding war on the Peninsula is significant. [source]\\nThe Trump administration introduced additional sanctions against the Venezuelan government in a bid to punish the Maduro regime. Immediately, the Russian government accused the US of setting the stage for military intervention, which is not an unfounded accusation: just two weeks ago a spokesman for the Pentagon claimed that the U.S. military has “a range of options” for Venezuela should the Trump administration decide to act. That was just after President Trump said he would not rule out military options for the country. A Russian statement condemned the U.S. over the additional sanctions, saying: “[T]he administration is exploring options for further tightening its policy, including the potential use of force against Venezuela only ‘in case of deterioration of the situation’… [W]hat are the current US sanctions designed to achieve? … Clearly, the very logic of sanctions implies further increasing tensions.” [source]',\n",

       " {'text': 'First, I want to wish all of you a Happy New Year. This starts the second year of our blog. We’ve designed the blog as an auxiliary resource that expands on the ideas covered in our book Design: A Beginner’s Handbook. With that in mind I thought it would be useful to explore the work of the photographer Erica Baum.\\nWhere do ideas come from? This question comes up often for beginning students and artists. Is there some magic answer? For an artist like Baum the answer resides close to home and is found in her personal history.\\nBaum has always loved reading and writing. As early as elementary school she was receiving awards for her stories. She went on to get a degree in anthropology and later an MA in teaching English as a second language. At the same time, she was involved with art from a young age and after receiving that MA she went back to school to get an MFA in Photography.\\nBaum is known for photographs that recontextualize found text. She zooms in close, often highlighting a single word or a small segment of a larger sentence or paragraph. The photographs become poetic spaces that combine the formal considerations found in visual art with word associations and abstract storytelling.\\nWhen Baum first entered graduate school she says that “I began my work there in almost anthropological fashion, taking photographs of college life – fascinated, in particular, by Yale’s preppy, upper-middle-class aspects, which were foreign to me. Gradually I focused less on the students and more on details and textures, until I found myself photographing the squiggles, marks and partial erasures left on blackboards after classes were dismissed.” The image above is an example of one of these blackboard photographs – cropped so that the source is unclear and the viewer must become an active participant in explaining, and thus completing, the image. Of this work Baum comments, “I’d established a set of parameters within which theoretically endless encounters could unfold.”\\nOne day Baum went to photograph blackboards but discovered that all the rooms were occupied. Instead, she found herself in the library with her large view camera, peering into the card catalogs (still in use in the early 1990s). Opening a drawer “…was a kind of revelation: there were whole worlds in there. Photography, I realized, was a form of concentration; I could turn my attention to anything.”\\nHer Card Catalog Series is filled with absurd juxtapositions that appear as a natural part of the library ordering system. Words bump up against each other for no other reason than an alphabetical connection, leading the viewer to project their own associations onto the text.\\nBaum’s work over the last twenty years has continued the investigations into found text that she began in graduate school.\\nI find these photographs from Baum’s Naked Eye Series remarkably beautiful. The photographs appear to be intricate collages that combine abstraction and figuration. But in fact, these aren’t collages at all. They are photographs of cheap paperback books from the 1950s and 60s, fanned open, the garish colors of the page edges forming the vertical compositional lines. Partially visible figures gaze out from the books. The name for the series comes from the first book Baum photographed, a book on UFOs that included eyewitness assertions that what they saw was real. “When something is seen with the naked eye it is supposed to be unmanipulated and true. It’s like the camera’s lens that we no longer believe delivers only just the facts.”\\nThe photographs above are part of Baum’s Dog-Eared Series. Who hasn’t found themselves folding down the corner of a book page as a place marker. Unlike most people Baum noticed the accidental “found” poems in these folds, which she turned into a type of concrete poetry. As is the case in all of Baum’s work there is a strong visual and formal presentation that is combined with linguistic investigations to make a hybrid form.\\nLike many of the artists we’ve discussed this past year Baum looks closely at the surrounding world, honing in on the easily overlooked and turning it into something worthy of a viewer’s attention. So my advice to you is pay attention, anything can become transformed into a work of art.',\n",

       " {'text': 'Karen Ferguson discovers a book with plenty of practical advice for new SENCOs, and a healthy respect fo workload and wellbeing\\nAny aspiring or newly appointed primary SENCO will benefit from the wealth of experience Jackie Ward has drawn on to write this book. It’s an easy-to-read and realistic “how to” guide that shows a real appreciation for the reality of the job on the ground. With teacher workload and wellbeing causing so much concern across the education system, it’s a testament to Ward that this theme is the golden thread that ties all the chapters together.\\nThe book itself seems designed with this in mind. The layout is clear and accessible, drawing attention to the interesting case studies, effective top tips and key “take aways” from each of its 11 chapters.\\nFor a more experienced practitioner, some of the advice could possibly border on patronising. However, there are enough golden nuggets throughout to make it a good read for even the most seasoned SENCO, and in any case, positive reinforcement is always comforting in what can be an isolating role.\\nEach chapter focuses on a specific aspect of a SENCO’s responsibilities, and Ward’s singular focus throughout is to give practical advice to move readers forward in their development of the role. Early chapters break down the support that SENCOs can give to children, parents and colleagues, with each group of stakeholders getting their own dedicated chapter. The chapter for children is linked directly to current guidelines, the one on parental support is a good starting point for signposting and meetings, and the one on working with colleagues (in reality, often the most challenging part of the job) clearly identifies their most common areas of need and provides useful advice on how to support them.\\nIt is great to see wellbeing and workload being discussed\\nA later chapter on working with outside agencies will be very beneficial for any new SENCO. It sets out clearly what each agency’s role is in supporting students, and the “Pros and Cons” section is of particular interest. Knowing that the challenges of waiting lists and appointments are not just in your own area is comforting in its own right.\\nFor me, the most interesting and useful chapter is the one entitled “Applying for statutory assessment: EHCPs” – a fantastic go-to guide with step-by-step advice on the process. Starting with who may request, and providing what is almost a checklist of what is needed before even getting started, it goes on to lay out a clear timeline of the process. The latter is clear about what to expect at each stage, how to use the EHCP once it is in place, and even how to handle appeals and mediation – an area that is not often openly discussed or shared. This will be invaluable for anyone working with EHCPs for the first time. I certainly would have appreciated it when I started.\\nUnfortunately, for all the focus on workload and wellbeing, the advice on how to manage it is not as strong or as practical as the advice on doing the job itself. While the book will no doubt help new SENCOs hack their way to more efficient practices, most of the specific tips for workload and wellbeing appear to rely on asking senior leaders for dispensation. In an ideal world, this should be sufficient but, especially in smaller and more rural schools, SENCOs not only have teaching commitments but other responsibilities too. Having said that, it is great to see wellbeing and workload being discussed, and the emphasis on the need to look after oneself before you can support others is something all new practitioners should be taught.\\nOverall then, this is a very welcome book that can only be a benefit to newly appointed or aspiring SENCOs. With guidance linked to the latest legislation, and a clear structure taking in all the role’s main responsibilities, Ward has given us an excellent tool to ensure more can get on the right track towards sustained and sustainable careers in primary SEND.',\n",

       " {'text': 'Graduate Student Expectations\\nThis complements the common and other guidelines. Suggestions and input are welcome.\\nWhat I expect from you\\nYou will take ownership of your educational experience\\n- You will need to determine the requirements for your individual graduate program and are responsible for insuring that you are in compliance. As you progress, I will work with you to select courses, qualifying exams, and committee members.\\n- You will keep me updated on your research progress and challenges.\\n- To earn your degree you must transition towards independence. We will work together to track this process, but ultimately when you earn a degree will be up to the work you produce, not simply the time you put in.\\n- Seek out professional development opportunities—being a successful scientist involves more than being good at the bench. You must communicate well (presentations, papers, grants), develop personal skills (lab management, mentoring), maintain high ethical standards, and for a faculty career, teach. At the same time, these opportunities must be balanced with the most important element of your career development—research progress towards your thesis.\\nYou will develop your personal research skills\\n- Keep up to date with the scientific literature: Read the papers I suggest. Spend some time each week updating your literature and just browsing. Subscribe to relevant eTOCs.\\n- Learn how to plan your experiments so that they help you progress on the overall goal of your project. Make sure your experiments address the question of interest correctly – this includes learning how to do the appropriate controls, techniques, etc. You will also need to learn how to effectively plan and multi-task to prevent down times. Develop plans with short/medium/long-term goals.\\n- Develop your writing and presentation skills. As you start to make progress, begin outlining a paper’s figures and drafting the text. Be prepared to go through rounds of revisions before submitting an abstract or paper. Although the availability of travel funds will vary, I encourage you to submit your work for presentation at one conference per year. Attend relevant seminars; I suggest 1-2/month to learn both science and how to give a good talk.\\n- Consider applying for fellowships, traineeships, and travel grants. Not only will an award help your career and the overall lab funding, the experience of writing the proposal will help you think about what you are doing more deeply.\\n- Learn how to accept and utilize constructive criticism. Feedback from me, colleagues, committee members, and course instructors is intended to improve your work.\\nYou will contribute to the lab and be a good lab citizen\\n- Senior graduate students are responsible for helping to train new graduate students in the ways of the world (e.g. lab procedures, how individual/group meetings work, literature searches). Science is a community; many people will help you along the way and you should return the favor. Share your insider knowledge of techniques with others.\\n- You will have designated lab jobs such as ordering, general maintenance, taking care of one of the instruments, etc. Failure to do your lab jobs not only affects you, it can impede the entire lab and will not be tolerated. Everyone is expected to help with dishes, making sure that supplies do not run out, reporting problems with equipment to the person in charge, aliquotting, and general lab cleanliness.\\nWhat is Required for a M.S. Degree\\nMy definition for when the M.S. degree is complete represents a combination of scientific productivity and intellectual development. Scientific productivity reflects papers publishing and meeting presentations. Intellectual development derives from your ability to function as a researcher and to organize scientific data and assemble a story. For a master’s student, I would expect one to two published papers to be submitted before or at graduation. Generally, a M.S. can be completed in two years.\\n1st year – Goal: Become familiar with the laboratory and the techniques used. You should be able to perform the techniques and understand why each component is done in the way in which it is performed. During this time, you will learn a great deal from the senior people within the lab. Be courteous: make an appointment with them, and do as much background reading as possible to be able to have a discussion. During this year, you need to develop the skills to multi-task, as classes should not take up all of your time.\\n2nd year – Goal: Collecting focused data that will allow you to submit papers for publication. During this year, you will finish your required courses, but experiments will be your most important responsibility, as you begin to acquire greater depth in the field through analysis of data, conversations with other in the lab, as well as reading the literature. As you leave, you will ensure your project can be continued by a future student through careful documentation and/or hands-on training. We will also begin working on strategies to transition to your next career stage.\\nWhat is Required for a Ph.D. Degree\\nMy definition for when the PhD is complete represents a combination of scientific productivity and intellectual development (much like for M.S. degree, but these are much more in depth for a doctoral candidate). Scientific productivity reflects papers publishing and meeting presentations. Intellectual development derives from your ability to function as an independent researcher, to organize complex ideas, and assemble a multi-part story. For a PhD student, I would expect two to four published papers to be submitted before or at graduation. The amount of time this takes can vary, but outlined below is a general plan.\\n1st year – Goal: Become familiar with the laboratory and the techniques used. You should be able to perform the techniques and understand why each component is done in the way in which it is performed. During this time, you will learn a great deal from the senior people within the lab. Be courteous: make an appointment with them, and do as much background reading as possible to be able to have a discussion. In terms of the project, I generally provide a starting point, and it is up to the graduate student to identify which direction you would like your project to go, within reason (I help to identify what is reasonable). During first two years, you need to develop the skills to multi-task, as classes should not take up all of your time.\\n2nd year – Goal: Preparing for qualifying exams and research preliminary. Experiments continue as you finish classes, however you begin to acquire greater depth in the field through conversations with other in the lab, as well as reading the literature. You are able to design your own experiments, and are able to integrate the necessary techniques available in the lab to your project. You should be able to critically evaluate the techniques and their potential/limitations. Group meetings and individual meetings are opportunities to present and discuss ideas, gain feedback from others, and to work through the details so that the best experiments are performed as you refine your project.\\n3rd year – Goal: Complete research preliminary. You are the major driver of your project and you now have the time to focus on the research. You should be completely comfortable performing your research (designing experiments) and know all of the necessary background. Because of your understanding of the lab, you should be able to go beyond the techniques available in the lab and incorporate new skills into your research. In regards to your project, I expect that you become more of an expert about your project than I am. You are done with classes and should really pick up the pace of your research. You should be preparing to assume a leadership position in the lab and help the less experienced people joining the lab. This year is often very challenging as you navigate these transitions.\\n4th year and on – Goal: Write manuscripts and thesis. While the exact timing of when manuscripts are written will vary, you will hopefully have one to two projects nearing publication stage. We will then discuss what you should focus your remaining time on to complete your thesis. At this time, you will take a greater responsibility in developing future projects, while at the same time mentoring newer students. Mentoring newer students is expected of you, though you can require that they make appointments with you. We will also begin working on strategies to transition to your next career stage.\\nAdapted from documents by Pam Kreeger.',\n",

       " {'text': 'Managing Director & Partner\\nTrade has been enormously important to the steel-producing and steel-consuming industries. Global steel exports have been growing in absolute terms for the past 70 years, virtually without interruption, and they have accounted for 30% to 40% of all steel produced during the past three decades. (See Exhibit 1.) The benefits of the steel trade, which amounts to more than 400 million metric tons shipped per year, have been incalculable: abundant supply, lower material costs for construction companies and manufacturers, more affordable products for consumers, and competitive pressures that have encouraged steel producers all over the world to specialize and innovate.\\nBut just as trade has been a fixture of the steel business, so has trade conflict. Both producers and consumers of steel have grown accustomed to coping with legal battles over allegations of dumping and unfair subsidies that have led to sharp spikes in tariffs on traded steel products. Rarely, however, has the global business landscape been as challenging to navigate as it is today. The number of antidumping duty orders in force on specific countries’ steel exports has been rising by around 10% per year since 2012, according to World Trade Organization (WTO) data. The US added a complex new dimension to the steel trade in March 2018 by citing national security as a justification for imposing a 25% tariff on steel imports from virtually all countries. In response, the European Union and Canada have moved to safeguard their own producers from a surge in steel imports.\\nThese antidumping actions and high US national-security tariffs have achieved their desired first-order effects. Our analysis reveals that the antidumping duties imposed by the US and Europe over the past two years on carbon flat steel have sharply reduced imported steel products from the targeted countries—by from 50% to 95%. The 25% tariffs that the US imposed in 2018 have boosted profit margins for domestic producers and increased capacity utilization in the domestic industry.\\nBut these policy interventions have come at a cost. Higher steel prices have raised material costs for construction companies and domestic manufacturers of goods as diverse as screws, vehicles, and kitchen appliances, and not all of these companies are in a position to pass the added costs on to their customers. Because far more workers are employed in steel-consuming companies than in steel-producing ones, some economists warn that high tariffs will cause more economic harm than good in the US, by forcing steel users to shift production or procurement of assembled components offshore. The various trade actions have also created uncertainty. Because recently imposed tariffs could change again as a result of further trade negotiations, it is more difficult for companies to enter into long-term contracts with steel suppliers and for steel producers to make investment decisions regarding new capacity, technologies, and products that could define their competitiveness years into the future.\\nHistorical context helps to explain why the current trade environment is so challenging. Steel has long been at the center of global trade policy. And though trade has been good for steel consumers, domestic steel makers and workers have generally opposed imports and more open trade. In general, there has been considerable political support for protecting domestic steel industries, which are seen as critical sources of high-paying jobs and are strategically important for other sectors.\\nTraditionally, nations have protected their steel industries with tariffs. The post–World War II movement to ease protectionism, which began with the 1948 General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), resulted in the first rounds of international tariff cuts. All GATT member nations agreed to grant each other equal trade privileges. In 1952, six European nations began managing their steel production and markets through the European Coal and Steel Community—the precursor of the European Union. Intended to make wars between France and Germany materially impossible, the move also eliminated tariffs on coal and steel between member nations and resulted in an alignment of tariffs for nonmembers.\\nBy the 1970s, however, claims of unfair steel exports began to appear. The US accused European steel makers of damaging its domestic steel industry by dumping their products at prices lower than they charged in their home markets. As more nations entered global steel markets, complaints proliferated that governments were unfairly subsidizing their steel industries in order to seize competitive advantage in export markets. In antidumping and countervailing duty (CVD) actions, which occur in response to subsidies, importing nations assess tariffs against the goods of targeted nations as a remedy for damage that the market presence of those goods inflicts on domestic producers. The EU and the US employ both instruments, but they follow significantly different approaches in doing so. (See the sidebar.) These policy tools are supposed to follow frameworks and rules set by WTO agreements concluded in 1994, which built on earlier GATT agreements and replaced the GATT organization with the WTO.\\nActions against alleged unfair trading practices in steel and other industries generally fall into three categories:\\nThe importing country takes action under its own domestic trade remedy laws, which must be consistent with baseline WTO rules. According to these rules, the complaining party must not only prove that imports were dumped or unfairly subsidized, but also that one or more domestic producers suffered material injury (in the case of antidumping and CVD actions) or serious injury or the threat thereof (in the case of safeguards). Injury is essentially the economic cost of lost revenue and profits. Normally, if companies cannot prove that they have suffered injury, national authorities are not legally permitted to apply tariffs.\\nEven though trade remedy laws must conform to WTO rules, countries’ policy and legal processes are marked in practice by considerable variation. This, in turn, gives countries significant latitude to manage their own trade policy levers.\\nThe EU and the US, for example, use different methods to determine remedy tariffs in antidumping and CVD actions. The EU imposes a duty that compensates for the dumping margin or unfair subsidies, or it imposes a duty that compensates for the injury to domestic producers—whichever is lower. This is known as the lesser duty rule. Often, the difference between the dumping margin and the injury margin is significant but difficult to calculate. Furthermore, the EU considers the potential economic harm of a remedy duty on domestic companies that use steel as well as on EU consumers. This is known as the community interest test in EU trade policy.\\nThe US, by contrast, imposes remedy tariffs equal to both the full dumping margin and the unfair subsidies. As a result, trade remedy tariffs on imported goods from targeted countries tend to be much higher in the US than in the EU. Moreover, when determining the duty, the US considers the economic impact on producers only, not on steel users and end consumers.\\nThe high tariffs that the US imposed on all steel and aluminum imports in March 2018 represent a different kind of action. The government asserted that the action was necessary under Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which seeks to ensure that the US is not beholden to hostile foreign powers for defense and security procurement. Prior to the 2018 action, Section 232 tariffs had been implemented only five times since 1962—and against petroleum imports in each instance, never against steel.\\nThe use of national security provisions in domestic trade law has not yet been tested before a WTO dispute settlement panel. WTO members Canada, China, the EU, India, Mexico, Norway, Russia, Switzerland, and Turkey have filed WTO complaints alleging that the US’s Section 232 tariffs on steel and aluminum violate WTO rules. Some observers believe that a WTO panel would be reluctant to define what is or is not in the national security interest of a member state. However, a panel might rule on whether the trade policy implemented is necessary to achieve an asserted national security interest. In any event, WTO processes can take many years to reach a conclusion, so any near- to middle-term relief from the Section 232 tariffs would require a negotiated solution.\\nChina’s arrival as a steel superpower has further altered the industry’s dynamics. Even though China exports only a small percentage of its output, the sheer scale of its production has generated annual steel exports that in some years have exceeded 100 million tons, leading to trade friction around the globe. Antidumping and CVD actions accelerated in 2015 and 2016 following a surge of Chinese steel exports. In 2018, 33% of the 696 steel antidumping and CVD trade actions that were then in force targeted China. (See Exhibit 2.)\\nThe use of antidumping and CVD actions is a policy choice, however. In practice, many WTO member states do not use these trade defense instruments at all.\\nTo assess the impact of trade remedies on steel markets, we analyzed antidumping cases brought by the US and the EU against countries that accounted for similar volume shares of imports during roughly the same time frame—from 2015 through 2017—in four categories of carbon flat steel: hot-rolled coil, cold-rolled coil, cut-to-length plate, and hot-dipped galvanized steel. Coil refers to sheets and strips of steel that are shipped in rolls.\\nWe analyzed import volumes, steel prices, and spreads between steel prices and the prices of the raw materials required to produce a ton of steel for each steel product category, as well as overall producer profit margins following the imposition of higher duties.1 Notes: 1 In analyzing the impact of duties on sales volumes of steel products, we used the EU eight-digit Combined Nomenclature and the US ten-digit Harmonized Tariff Schedule code used to classify traded goods for customs purposes in the EU and the US. We used as a starting point the date when the importing country imposed the remedial duties, which is usually the time when that country has made a preliminary decision. Although a country typically takes 10 to 15 months to reach a final decision in a trade case, it applies tariffs as soon as it announces the preliminary decision—and the vast majority of preliminary decisions are ultimately confirmed. Consequently, in order to reduce risk, exporters usually change their practices soon after a case is initiated, rather than wait for the final outcome.\\nOur analysis found that antidumping actions are generally effective in achieving their stated goals. In each case we examined, the trade actions led to an immediate reduction, ranging from almost 50% to 95%, in imports from the targeted countries. Market prices for the steel products and producer profit margins were significantly higher one year later.2 Notes: 2 In a wider context, steel prices rose from the very low levels of the second half of 2015. The low prices were in large part due to the massive increase in steel exports from China. In fact, in real terms, prices during this period were as low as during the most recent global steel crisis, in 2001, which had led to the previous wave of US antidumping and CVD measures. Yet even though the US imposed much higher duties (up to 266%) than the EU (up to 74%), the impact of their duties on prices and spreads was comparable. Nearly every action we studied resulted in significantly higher spreads one year later in the EU and US for those specific flat-steel products. Spreads in the US increased by 16% to 32% per ton year on year, depending on the category, and in the EU by 8% to 36% per ton year on year. The only exception involved galvanized steel, for which spreads declined by 9% per ton year on year in the US.\\nHot-Rolled Coil and Cut-to-Length Plate. Hot-rolled flat products constitute the largest internationally traded steel category. Trade actions by the EU and the US had similar effects on price spreads in hot-rolled coil and cut-to-length plate, although the effect on market shares of foreign versus domestic suppliers differed. From 2006 to 2016, the EU did not protect its industry for these products at all. In 2016, after a surge in imports, the EU targeted hot-rolled coil from China, Russia, Ukraine, and Brazil and cut-to-length steel plate from China and India. High duties helped EU countries dramatically slash imports of both types of products from the targeted nations. However, suppliers from other, nontargeted nations captured most of the resulting shift in market share. In the case of hot-rolled coil, while imports from targeted countries fell by 69% and spreads rose by 33%, imports from nontargeted countries increased by 79%. Ultimately, shipments by domestic EU producers rose by only 1%. (See Exhibit 3.)\\nIn contrast, the US had for nearly two decades used high antidumping duties and CVDs to shut out major foreign suppliers such as China, Russia, and Ukraine from its domestic market for hot-rolled coil and cut-to-length plate. In 2015 and 2016, the US imposed high duties on additional countries, including South Korea, Brazil, and Australia. By the following year, imports from these targeted nations fell by more than 40%. But because few other nations could economically ship large quantities of hot-rolled coil and cut-to-length plate, US imports from third countries increased only slightly. Consequently, domestic US producers increased their shipments of hot-rolled coil by 5%, even as domestic demand declined slightly. Despite the significant reduction in steel imports, however, spreads in the US rose by 32%—a pace similar to that in the EU (33%)—even though steel imports in the EU remained steady.\\nCold-Rolled Coil and Hot-Dipped Galvanized Steel. Both the EU and the US pursued antidumping cases involving these further processed products, and these efforts yielded similar results. EU markets were open to cold-rolled and galvanized steel imports until 2016. The US had also largely opened its market during the period from 2006 to 2016. Then, when imports into both markets surged, the EU and the US responded with trade actions.\\nThe EU targeted China and Russia, its two biggest import sources. A year after the EU enacted high duties, imports of cold-rolled coil and hot-dipped galvanized steel from China and Russia plunged. But EU imports of these same products from Turkey, India, Egypt, and other sources skyrocketed, leaving overall import levels stable. The US targeted more countries than the EU and imposed much higher remedial duties. But as was the case in the EU, imports of cold-rolled and galvanized steel from other nations into the US replaced those from the target countries, and total US import volume remained about the same.\\nIn early 2017, the US Department of Commerce concluded that imports of steel and aluminum constituted a threat to national security. Then, in March 2018, the US levied protective duties of 25% on imported steel and 10% on aluminum under the rarely used Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, which authorizes the US president to restrict imports under certain circumstances.\\nThis massive intervention against nearly all imported steel products from all foreign countries—regardless of the fairness of their trading practices—was unprecedented. The US’s stated goal was to increase its domestic steel industry’s capacity utilization to 80% by reducing imports by 13 million tons per year.\\nArticle 21 of GATT permits a country to take “any action which it considers necessary for the protection of its essential security interests.” But several nations are challenging the legality of the US actions in the WTO Dispute Settlement Body, contending that its true aim in invoking Section 232 is protectionism, and that their steel exports to the US pose no threat to US national security. The US maintains that it is free to define what constitutes its national security and that, therefore, WTO rules do not prohibit its actions. A number of countries have responded with retaliatory tariffs on select US exports representing similar dollar volumes of steel, aluminum, and other, unrelated products.\\nRetaliatory tariffs are just one type of regulatory intervention that governments may adopt. Safeguards—temporary, emergency measures that countries enact to protect their industries from serious injury in the event of unforeseen, sharp, and sudden import surges—are another option. Such safeguards, which must meet tough preconditions, typically take the form of duties or quotas and apply to imports from all countries. Fearing that a diversion of steel exports from the US would lead to a surge in steel exports to their own markets, the EU, Canada, and other countries implemented their own safeguards soon after the US trade measure went into force.\\nThe EU safeguards, which went into effect on February 2, 2019, and will remain in force until July 2021, impose tariff-rate quotas on 26 categories of steel products. Countries with more than a 5% market share in a steel product category are assigned country-specific import quotas; all other countries are assigned the residual global tariff-rate quota for those products. Quotas are based on the average steel import volume of each product for the previous three years plus 5%. Imports up to quota level will enter the EU according to its normal published tariff schedule. Once imports of specific products reach the specified level, the EU will impose a safeguard tariff of 25% on any additional volume. The free-from-safeguards quota level is set to rise by 5% in July 2019 and by another 5% in July 2020. Nations that were already subject to antidumping and CVD tariffs fall under the global quota. Because a large share of hot-rolled coil imports was already subject to antidumping duties, the EU did not set country-specific quotas in this important product category.\\nOn the basis of data available so far, it appears that the US’s Section 232 intervention achieved some—but not all—of its desired effects. Initially, domestic US steel producers clearly benefited from the 25% tariffs. Domestic steel capacity utilization rose from 75% in the first quarter of 2018 to 81% in the fourth quarter, achieving the US target. As yet there is not enough data available to make clear the impact on US steel import levels, but data does indicate that sharply higher domestic prices have translated into higher profits for US steel producers. Profitability in the US increased by 5 percentage points, while it remained largely unchanged in other parts of the world. Earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, and amortization for major US steel producers rose from 9% in the first quarter of 2018 to 14% in the third quarter, surpassing the average for all steel producers in developed economies.\\nThe big questions, however, are whether these gains are sustainable and whether they represent a net gain for the US economy. Global demand growth is slowing, and US steel prices have declined recently. There is some risk that they will fall further and that capacity utilization will drop as new production comes on line. Industry analysts estimate that if US steel makers follow through on all of their announcements, they will add more than 13 million metric tons of capacity during the period from early 2017 to 2023. Meanwhile, equity investors are concerned that the US government might roll back some of its tariff protections if it reaches new trade deals with major partners. After soaring initially, the shares of publicly listed US steel producers declined, on average, by 35% from March through December 2018, compared with a dip of only 3% in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.\\nFor the US economy, the gains of steel producers have been partially offset by the negative impact of the tariffs on US companies that use steel. One indicator of that impact—and of the importance of imported steel—is the number of applications (more than 44,000) for exemptions from the Section 232 tariffs filed as of December 20, 2018, by companies asserting that a lack of steel of the required quality or volume in the market is damaging their businesses. More than 14,000 of these applications were approved as of that date—more than three times as many as were denied. Also as of that date, more than 25,000 applications were still pending, underscoring the immense administrative challenge that the Section 232 tariffs pose for the US government. (See Exhibit 4.)\\nThe recent trade actions taken by the US are creating winners and losers among the world’s steel producers and consumers.\\nAmong national producers, the most immediate winners are US steel makers and their employees. The profitability of US integrated steel producers has increased. However, it has also improved for minimills, which are likely to continue taking market share from integrated steel producers regardless of tariff protection. Minimills use electric-arc furnace technology to make steel products, generally by melting and refining scrap and direct-reduced iron, rather than the blast furnaces that integrated mills use to produce steel from iron ore. In the past three decades, flat-steel minimills have increased their production while the output of integrated steel mills has declined—a trend that tariff protection will not change. Minimills have seized about half of the US market for flat steel, not including steel that is processed in rerolling mills. As the quality of their products improves, minimills are making inroads in the critical automotive sector. Most new investment in US steel capacity is flowing into facilities that deploy electric-arc furnace technology, which is less labor-intensive than blast-furnace technology. What’s more, companies are building a significant number of leading-edge minimills in the US South, rather than in the Midwest, where many of the older integrated mills are located.\\nIntegrated steel mills that are interested in seizing the opportunity currently offered by high tariff protection can do two things. First, they can invest in improving their efficiency. Second, they can focus on core business segments in which they still hold the strongest position and aim to deliver domestic high-quality products that require higher levels of customer service, such as just-in-time delivery, technical support, and collaborative R&D.\\nHigh-grade steel for automobiles is one product that meets these criteria. But producers must use this window of opportunity. The current tariff protection gives US producers the breathing room they need to take domestic market share from foreign producers and to improve their operations so that they will be stronger competitors after the tariffs are removed.\\nAmong producers of steel, the biggest losses will be felt by foreign suppliers, which have become less competitive in what was once a lucrative export market. In the immediate aftermath of the Section 232 action, the US agreed to exempt imports from a number of major partners, but it revoked those exemptions soon thereafter. Imports from Canada—the biggest foreign supplier—and Mexico continue to be charged a 25% tariff, even after those countries agreed to the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement that is to replace NAFTA.\\nMany American companies for which steel is an indispensable raw material will also pay a steep price, as will their customers. In the fabricated metals and steel-processing industries, steel often represents 30% to 80% of the material cost. Among highly steel-intensive manufacturers that have the most to lose are makers of boilers, storage tanks, shelving, springs, screws, pipes, tubes, and wire. The higher steel prices resulting from the Section 232 tariffs may endanger their ability to compete in domestic and export markets.\\nIn many sectors, steel is the first step in extensive value chains. Higher steel prices, therefore, create cost pressures that get pushed down the chain to steel-consuming industries. Construction, automotive, and machinery companies—the steel industry’s biggest customers—will be negatively affected. Manufacturers of kitchen appliances, farm machinery, and motorcycles have already reported that higher material costs are affecting their profitability.\\nGiven the vast size of steel-consuming industries—the fabricated metals and steel-processing industries alone employ ten times as many workers as US iron and steel mills do—the negative impact on overall US employment and investment could outweigh employment gains in the steel sector.\\nAmerican manufacturers that are not directly affected by the steel tariffs also face risks as US trade partners decide whether to retaliate against their industries. The EU has imposed retaliatory tariffs on such important US products as motorcycles, Kentucky bourbon, and Florida orange juice. Canada has targeted cranberries from Wisconsin. The aim in each case is to produce a comparable financial effect and maximum political impact.\\nThe landscape of the global steel trade will continue to shift, sometimes radically. Tariff policy is just one element of this changing global environment, which is also being redefined by alterations in local-content requirements, nontariff barriers, and regulations. The impact of these changes on companies will depend on the companies’ position in the steel-processing value chain and on the locations of their production facilities or suppliers.\\nIt is critical, therefore, that companies be proactive. They must develop an effective way to identify and mitigate the risks—and to capture the opportunities—created by changes in the global trade landscape. They must also ensure that their organizations are flexible enough to act quickly in response to different scenarios.\\nManaging these risks and opportunities should not be solely the responsibility of companies’ legal or government affairs departments, nor of operating units. Instead, companies should manage them as fundamental strategic issues, with direct involvement of the CEO. Hence we recommend that executives take the following actions.\\nAs a first step, companies should dedicate resources to building their capacity to recognize, understand, and monitor shifts in geopolitics, macroeconomic trends, and the global trade order—and their impact on the company’s supply chain. One option might be to establish a trade impact unit, a dedicated cross-functional team that maintains connections with operations, procurement, legal affairs, communications, and marketing and sales.\\nLeaders along the steel supply chain should then allocate resources to several key initiatives. One such initiative would be to develop a trade strategy that defines clear guidelines for action under certain circumstances or in response to major changes in the business environment that affect the company’s strategic direction. The company should have a blueprint in place that identifies a specific response when a key component or raw material can no longer be sourced in the usual way.\\nLikewise, resources should be allocated to building internal and external networks that will help the company navigate challenges. It should acquire expertise in trade and compliance, for example, and build relationships with outside experts and associations that have relevant expertise and similar interests.\\nThe company also needs to dedicate resources to creating visibility in its global supplier network. For instance, it can use digital tools that foster a clear, real-time understanding of activities and repercussions in its supply chain.\\nThese initiatives will enable the trade impact team to carry out three key operational tasks, which we refer to as sense, prepare, and act. (See Exhibit 5.)\\nSense. Companies should build an early-warning system for trade impact, on the basis of relevant data and close monitoring of political and economic developments. They should also understand how changes in the cost and flow of business inputs and outputs are likely to affect their competitive position, thereby enabling company leaders to make the necessary preparations to move boldly, regardless of the particular outcome.\\nFor steel companies that export to nations that have their own domestic steel industries, the early-warning system should include a keen awareness of prices both at home and abroad to avoid incurring dumping sanctions. Leaders should ensure that sales agents are aware of the consequences of selling steel in such markets at prices below those in the domestic market.\\nSteel-consuming companies should conduct a bottom-up analysis of the entire value chain—from the upstream supplier base to operations and asset investments in each country in which they operate to downstream distribution channels and end customers. The trade impact team should assess the company’s vulnerability to changes in revenues, costs, and asset utilization under a number of plausible trade scenarios. Automotive OEMs, for example, should understand how higher steel costs in different countries will affect assembly operations and key components for each model line.\\nThis analysis should include assessment of the risk exposure of competitors. CEOs should understand whether their competitors are less vulnerable or more vulnerable to trade actions. The results could reveal opportunities on the revenue side. If a company’s competitor has to increase prices in a certain market as a result of tariffs, for example, this situation could create an opportunity for the first company to raise its own prices without increasing its cost base—or to go on the offensive and seize market share by maintaining prices that are too low for the competitor to match.\\nPrepare. To help the company remain agile, the trade impact team should use information and analysis to prepare responses to changes in trade policies. Having a flexible playbook of actions will enable leaders to respond to potential trade policy scenarios, reduce exposure to high tariffs, and seize windows of opportunity to create an advantage.\\nSteel producers in nations that are targets of a trade remedy action and wish to fight the action should prepare evidence to demonstrate that their exports are not damaging domestic industries in the importing country. They should also plan initiatives for winning additional customers in markets with low trade barriers. Steel producers who stand to benefit from tariffs should have plans on hand for ramping up production so that they can move as quickly as possible to gain share from foreign competitors in their domestic market when the latter find themselves at a disadvantage.\\nSteel-consuming companies can prepare by taking preemptive moves in anticipation of a trade action. They can secure supply and price protection with current suppliers and line up potential alternative suppliers to reduce exposure and provide strategic flexibility. When feasible, construction companies or manufacturers could prequalify suppliers from a different country so that they can shift to them as quickly as possible if antidumping tariffs go into effect. In some situations, importing a finished component that contains tariff-impacted steel, rather than making the component, may be another viable option.\\nThe playbook should include options for decisive moves when it becomes clear that a country’s trade policy will indeed change. Companies should be prepared to shift production or find new markets as soon as a country initiates trade action against them. Steel consumers should have plans to adjust manufacturing and supplier footprints under various scenarios. They should have strategies for negotiating prices and securing alternative production facilities, materials, and labor in new locations. Specific triggers for taking action—such as commencement of an antidumping investigation—can aid companies in reacting swiftly.\\nLeaders of steel-consuming companies should also pursue proactive strategies for influencing trade policy outcomes. Companies should communicate with government actors at all levels to impress upon decision makers how their businesses will be affected by new trade restrictions. They should seek allies among companies, community organizations, workers, and other stakeholders that benefit from their business. Companies must also clearly communicate to customers, employees, suppliers, and shareholders that they are prepared to survive and thrive in the face of altered trade agreements.\\nAct. Steel producers that are targets of an antidumping action must act as soon as the country’s investigation begins, because the risks involved in waiting until the government reaches its preliminary and final determinations are too high. In addition to examining the feasability of entering new markets, companies should consider significantly altering their products in ways that might allow them to be reclassified in a way that renders them no longer subject to tariffs. If an importing country decides to impose quotas on steel products from its country, the company needs to move quickly to secure quota allotments.\\nSteel-consuming companies that face little competitive pressure or that cannot shift production should determine how much of the added material costs of high tariffs they can pass on to customers in the form of higher prices—and how much they must absorb themselves. Manufacturers whose competitive position will be damaged by high steel tariffs should begin the process of shifting production and supply sources as soon as the country issues a preliminary determination. If a manufacturer relies on a particular steel material that is subject to import quotas, it must move as quickly as possible to secure supplies. Otherwise, the company will be at risk of not being able to procure a critical material once that quota is filled for the year.\\nIf possible, steel consumers facing higher prices due to protective tariffs on their materials should seek tariff exemptions from their government. At the same time, they must shift their sources of supply and manufacturing operations as swiftly as possible. Agility is the key to minimizing the impact on costs—and seizing competitive advantage against competitors that are slower to respond.\\nDecades of relatively free world trade have been good for both producers and consumers of steel. While dealing with trade friction has always been part and parcel of the business, the global steel community must now adapt to a new era of prolonged, heightened volatility in an industry that has been accustomed to long-term planning. The companies that emerge as winners in this environment will be those that have the foresight to anticipate and mitigate risks and the agility to seize opportunity when it knocks.',\n",

       " {'text': 'Details regarding what Donald Trump calls his “Deal of the Century” on Israel-Palestine have reportedly been leaked. Not surprisingly, Palestinians find themselves the subject of a peace deal that fails to incorporate their input.\\nAccording to reports, Gulf nations will invest $4 billion in northern Sinai in Egypt near the Gaza Strip, and will establish an airport and seaport meant to serve the area. As a result, responsibility for the Gaza Strip will transfer to Egypt. This means it will be split off from the rest of Palestine, preventing a unified Palestinian state.\\nPhyllis Bennis, direct of the New Internationalism Project at the Institute for Policy Studies, joined The Real News Network’s Ben Norton to discuss the reported leaks.\\nMost of the details reported are not “new ideas,” said Bennis. Rather, they are “old, recycled ideas that essentially mean an end to the idea of an actual Palestinian state.”\\nBennis reiterated that no details from the leaks have been confirmed, and wondered aloud if they were leaked intentionally. “Some of the leaks may [have occurred]… to gauge” popular opinion among Palestinians in the region, as well as globally,” suggested Bennis.\\nWould Palestine be recognized as a state? “Maybe,” said Bennis, before explaining that if it were, it would be based “only in the land that Israel has, so far, not settled.” This amounts to only about 40 percent of the West Bank, according to Bennis.\\nWhat about Israeli settlers? Bennis believes that smaller, more remote Israeli outposts could likely be removed, but that a majority of larger settlements — along with “80 percent of settlers” — would remain.\\nAnother major concern is the notion of a Palestinian capital. Will it be in Jerusalem? Bennis thinks not.\\nBennis noted there is a possibility the Israeli’s might concede a Palestinian capital in the small village of Abu Dis, which borders Jerusalem, but was clear that this option is unlikely to suffice.\\nAll of this sounds like bad news for Palestinians. So, what is the incentive for them to acquiesce? “Lots and lots of money,” said Bennis. The Saudis, she said, would likely contribute significant financial support to the improvement of the West Bank, while the UAE focused on Gaza.\\nThis new peace plan is based on the hope that “billions of dollars” of investments will pacify Palestinians.\\nAmong the leadership of Egypt, Israel, Qatar, Jordan, and others in the region, there seems to be a willingness to work purely among themselves on this issue. To these leaders, Bennis posed a crucial question: “How far do they think they can go without any Palestinian buy-in?”\\nIt appears that if and when a peace plan is implemented, it will likely be without the input of Palestinian voices.\\n“I think what we’re seeing here is a willingness on the part of all of these governments, the Arab states, [and] certainly Israel, led by the Trump administration, to say that Palestinian voices don’t matter,” said Bennis.',\n",

       " {'text': 'The seminal photographer talks carving out space, staying inspired and why she’s never been one for rules.\\nIn a career spanning six decades, the Baltimore-born photographer has been documenting creativity that falls outside of the mainstream. To mark a new respective of her work, she talks carving out space, staying inspired and why she’s never been one for rules.\\nMartha Cooper was born in Baltimore, USA, in 1942. She took her first photographs when she was just three years old.\\nIn the 1970s, she became the first woman to secure a staff photographer role at the New York Post. From there, she started a personal project on New York City’s emerging graffiti scene, and, in 1984, published the seminal book Subway Art with Harry Chalfant. It has never been out of print.\\nIn 2015, Cooper’s work was featured in the exhibition Bridges of Graffiti at the Venice Biennale,. Cooper has also published books such as Hip Hop Files (2004), We B* Girlz (2005), Street Play (2006), New York State of Mind (2007), Tag Town (2007), Going Postal (2009) and Tokyo Tattoo 1970 (2012). She was invited to speak on the theme ‘Out There’ at TEDxVienna in 2016.\\nThis autumn, a retrospective of Cooper’s career – curated by Steven P. Harrington and Jaime Rojo founders of BrooklynStreetArt.com – is opening at the Urban Nation Museum for Contemporary Urban Art in Berlin. Titled Martha Cooper: Taking Pictures, it includes unpublished photographs, drawings, journals, and Kodak film wallets, as well as images from her books and her travels around the world, and artworks from her personal collection – such as a pair of paintings by renown graffiti innovator Dondi. As well as that, the exhibition will debut a multi-channel video installation titled The Rushes by Selina Miles, who directed the 2019 documentary Martha: A Picture Story.\\nWhat attracted you to, and kept you interested in, photography over all these years?\\nMy uncle and dad owned a camera store. My dad used to take me looking for photos on outings he called “camera runs”. My mom taught high school journalism. So I guess the combination of the two led me to the documentary approach I have today. I’m still out looking. Taking pictures is a way of life.\\nHow did you get interested in photographing graffiti and hip hop culture in New York?\\nI was a staff photographer for the New York Post and was out on the street with my cameras every day. I began a personal project, documenting kids who were playing creatively among trash in the vast areas of vacant buildings and empty lots on the Lower Eastside near the newspaper’s headquarters.\\nA boy showed me his notebook with drawings he planned to paint on a wall. I was amazed that he was actually pre-designing graffiti. He offered to introduce me to a graffiti king, Dondi. After meeting Dondi I was hooked. In the process of documenting graffiti I became interested in hip hop as some of the writers were also rappers or breakers. By following graffiti, I stumbled upon hip hop.\\nYou were a white woman shooting the culture of predominantly much younger black guys in New York. Was that ever an issue, for you or for them?\\nThere have always been white, black and Latino graffiti writers. Being accepted into graffiti culture was and is dependent on skills. Writers’ crews were always interracial. Photography was important because photos were often the only proof of illegal subway pieces. In the 1980s few writers had good cameras so my skills as a photographer were my route to acceptance. Whenever possible, I gave photos to the writers of their pieces.\\nI was interested that you’ve shot graffiti and hip hop, Japanese tattoos, and kids’ games, and were involved with the City Lore, New York Centre for Urban Folk Culture. Could you say more about your interest in culture and creativity from outside the art establishment?\\nBefore deciding to become a professional photographer, I thought I would like to work in an anthropology museum because I had a longstanding interest in ethnic art. I spent a year at Oxford [UK] at the Pitt Rivers Museum getting a Diploma in Ethnology and then worked on collections at the Peabody Museum at Yale and the Smithsonian.\\nAt Oxford, I learned how important it is to look at art in the context of the cultures that produce it. Graffiti gave me a wonderful opportunity to do that. As an aside, I’m not interested in kids’ games with rules. That’s a different area of study. My interest is in creative play without rules – activities kids invent by themselves when their parents aren’t watching. Graffiti is a good example.\\nI was interested that you’ve shot both graffiti and murals. What does putting work into the public realm do, compared with putting it into museums, or even into art books?\\nPublic space is open to anyone with the inclination and energy to put their work out there. The gatekeepers are the police rather than gallery owners. Now with the internet, artists can paint a mural and put it online and not have to worry about whether it gets painted over.\\nIn addition, passersby can see, photograph and easily share the work without having to go inside a gallery. Getting your work – including photos – into art books and museums is a much lengthier and more difficult process.\\nI wondered if you’ve seen changes in the graffiti culture, particularly in the last couple of years. Do you see a renewed interest in politically orientated work post-Black Lives Matter?\\nGraffiti has gone from being an extreme underground activity of a few to a worldwide movement. There have been many changes in the tools and techniques of writing. Whereas there were only a few colours of spray paint available in the early 1980s, there are now companies producing hundreds of colours and manufacturing specialised spray caps specifically for graffiti.\\nI have been mostly on lockdown in my apartment for the past five and a half months so I can’t really speak about what’s happening in general. The media has certainly featured a lot of Black Lives Matter murals.\\nYou’ve been a successful photographer for six decades, which is a feat for anyone – but particularly for a woman in this era. How did you do it?\\nDetermination and persistence. I tried to set attainable goals and then work toward them. I learned to move on from rejections, of which there were many. I pursued my own projects and didn’t wait around for assignments.\\nWhat do you see as the photographer’s role? Is it about your vision, or do you have a more journalistic impulse in documenting other peoples’ creativity?\\nSpeaking only about how I see my role, not about photographers in general: I am interested in literal documentation. I try to take pictures where the person or activity can be seen clearly. Although I’m careful about framing and lighting, I don’t look for unusual or dramatic angles.\\nEven when my photos don’t work aesthetically, I like to think they contain subject matter of interest to future generations. For me, photography is a form of historic preservation.\\nMartha Cooper: Taking Pictures is showing at the Urban Nation Museum for Urban Contemporary Art, Berlin from 2 October, 2020 – 1 August, 2021.',\n",

       " {'text': \"19 July 2012 - The exploitation of human beings is a highly lucrative business for organized criminal groups. As a new UNODC campaign launched this week highlights, it is an illicit market which affects millions of victims worldwide every year. With traffickers making an estimated $32 billion annually, human trafficking is one of the world's most shameful crimes and one which robs people of their dignity and basic rights.\\nDeveloped to raise awareness around transnational organized crime, the campaign highlights some of the key threats being faced today - with human trafficking one of the leading concerns. The campaign, which can be seen on www.unodc.org/toc, includes a new video which is being rolled out online ( www.youtube.com/unodc) and through international broadcasters and illustrates the key financial and social costs of this international issue.\\nWhile the best-known form of human trafficking is for the purpose of sexual exploitation, hundreds of thousands of victims are also trafficked for forced labour, domestic servitude, child begging or the removal of their organs. The many different types of human trafficking means that there is no single, typical victim profile. Cases are seen in all parts of the world and victims are targeted irrespective of gender, age or background. Children, for example, might be trafficked from Eastern to Western Europe for the purpose of begging or as pickpockets; while young girls from Africa could be deceived with promises of modelling or au pair jobs only to find themselves trapped in a world of sexual and pornographic exploitation.\\nA central component of the campaign is driving action against transnational organized crime. It calls not just on Government authorities to act, but also highlights the role of communities and individuals.\\nSome of the steps that the campaign suggests in tackling human trafficking include:\\nAs the guardian of the United Nations Convention on Transnational Organized Crime and the Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children, supplementing Convention, UNODC has been at the forefront in tackling human trafficking. UNODC offers practical help to Member States, not only by helping to draft laws and create comprehensive national anti-trafficking strategies but also assisting with resources to implement them. At the national level, countries continue to implement the Protocol and work towards integrating anti-human trafficking legislation into their domestic laws.\\nTowards the end of 2012, UNODC will be publishing a new global report on trafficking in persons. Based on data collected from Member States, the report will provide a basis for evaluating how trends have changed since the last global UNODC data collection exercise in 2009 and will provide guidance as to what remains to be done.\\nUNODC also manages the United Nations Voluntary Trust Fund for Victims of Human Trafficking (especially women and children). Officially launched in 2010 by Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon, the Trust Fund supports the provision of on-the-ground humanitarian, legal and financial aid to victims of trafficking and provides members of the public an avenue through which they can donate to this important cause.\",\n",

       " {'text': 'The movie “All About Eve” has become many things since it first premiered on October 13, 1950. You can read all about it in Wikipedia’s “thematic content” of the movie here.\\nI first watched this award-winning film in the late 1980’s while living in Portland, Maine. Maybe I watched it on Turner Classic Movies or maybe I rented it at Videoport, Portland’s early and unmatched Tyrannosaurus Rex of movies.\\nI did not analyze the movie to any great extent. I like the whippet-fast dialogue and the over to top drama that is Bette Davis.\\nAnd I particularly liked this scene, where Bette Davis’s character, Margo Channing, analyzes her career:\\n“Funny business, a woman’s career. The things you drop on your way up the ladder– so you can move faster– you forget you’ll need them when you go back to being a woman. That’s one career all females have in common whether we like it or not. Being a woman. Sooner or later, we’ve got to work at it, no matter what other careers we’ve had or wanted. And in the last analysis nothing is any good unless you can look up just before dinner– or turn around in bed– and there he is. Without that you’re not a woman. You’re someone with a French provincial office– or a book full of clippings. But you’re not a woman. Slow curtain. The end.”\\nBack in the late 1980’s, when I was in my 20’s and my life looked like a blank canvass in front of me, I was focused on accomplishment. I did not think much about being a woman and what that meant. I thought about getting things done, getting ahead, acquiring stuff. My husband was not interested in those things although he never challenged or discouraged me from doing the things I wanted to do. I’m sure he watched “All About Eve” with me a time or two.\\nI left him, in part, because of our incompatible life goals.\\nSince that time, I have filled my book with clippings. Many women I’ve met while travelling this road have bigger and better clipping books than mine. After all, it’s a funny business, a woman’s career.\\nLook, I’ve thought about this post for a long time, maybe months. Maybe years. I know Margo Channing’s lines are just theatre; it’s a movie and movies are only imitations of life. But there is a reason they reverberated with me when I was 25 and why them come to me 30 years later as I turn 55. In the last analysis, nothing is any good unless you can look up just before dinner and there he is.\\nI don’t know what this means for me as I move forward into the twilight of my life. I would like to lean back and think about the tasks and projects I’ve undertaken in the last 30 years and drop some of them. I’m tired of coordinating volunteers and arranging things. I’d like to spend more time outside in the natural world. I’d like to wake up without panic and water my flowers instead of sitting at my computer at dawn cranking out a report or an article I’ll be paid less than minimum wage to write.\\nSo there you have it. I’m standing at the gate and contemplating the path.\\nIf I had a young daughter, getting ready to launch out into life, I would give her Margo Channing’s advice. Find a good man and do it while you’re young. Slow down, lean back, and live your life with no regrets. Keep your soft, womanly heart wide open.\\nSlow curtain. The end.',\n",

       " {'text': \"About this Research Topic\\nModern agriculture needs to review and broaden its practices and business models, by integrating opportunities coming from different adjacent sectors and value chains, including the bio-based industry, in a fully circular economy strategy. Searching for new tools and technologies to increase crop productivity under optimal and sub-optimal conditions and to improve resources use efficiency is crucial to ensure food security while preserving soil quality, microbial biodiversity, and providing business opportunities for farmers. Biostimulants based on microorganisms or organic substances obtained from renewable materials represent a sustainable, efficient technology or complement to synthetic counterparts, to improve nutrient use efficiency and secure crop yield stability. Under the new European Union Regulation 2019/1009, plant biostimulants were defined based on four agricultural functional claims as follows: Plant biostimulants are products that stimulate plant nutrition processes independently of the product's nutrient content with the sole aim of improving one or more of the following characteristics of the plant and/or the plant rhizosphere: 1) nutrient use efficiency, 2) tolerance resistance to (a)biotic stress, 3) quality characteristics or 4) availability of confined nutrients in the soil or rhizosphere’. Many diverse natural substances and chemical derivatives of natural or synthetic compounds, as well as beneficial microorganisms, are cataloged as plant biostimulants including i) humic substances, ii) plant or animal-based protein hydrolysates, iii) macro and micro-algal extracts, iv) silicon, v) arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) and vi) plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) belonging to the Azotobacter, Azospirillum and Rhizobium genera.\\nMicrobial and non-microbial plant biostimulants are usually used for open field and greenhouse crops. The biostimulants market is increasing year by year; with the market of biostimulant, active ingredients (amino acids, seaweed extracts, humic substances, and selected microorganisms or their metabolites) is estimated to account for 2.6 billion dollars in 2019 and is projected to reach almost $US 5 billion by 2025. Moreover, in the last 10 years (2010-2020) more than 1,000 scientific papers on ‘plant biostimulants’ were published and a bigger number of articles are available on the Scopus database using related words/terms (i.e., humic substances, seaweed extracts, microalgae, silicon, AMF or PGPR and microbial metabolites). Despite the huge scientific and commercial interest in microbial and non-microbial plant biostimulants, the detailed molecular, cellular, and physiological mechanisms underlying plant-biostimulant interactions under different environments and management strategies remain largely unknown. Therefore, there is an urgent need among the scientific community and commercial enterprises to better elucidate the causal/functional mechanisms of biostimulants, their potential side-effects on the environment, and their effect on the incidence or prevalence of plant or human pathogens. The elucidation of mechanisms from plant biostimulants will permit the development of a second generation of biostimulants where synergistic and complementary mechanisms can be functionally designed.\\nThis Research Topic welcome Original Research, Review*, Policy and Practice Reviews, Methods, Opinion and Perspectives dissecting the agricultural functions and action mechanisms of plant biostimulants under optimal and adverse environmental situations (e.g., salinity, drought, thermal stress, suboptimal pH values, heavy metals, nutrient stress) or in optimum growing conditions. This compilation of hypothesis-driven studies on the physiological mechanisms of plant biostimulants will foster discussions within this new field, promote collaborations, and provide important information needed for downstream translational research, including designing and formulating biostimulants.\\n*Please note: If you intend to submit a Review Article you are highly encouraged to submit an abstract, highlighting the area of focus, and a suggested table of contents.\\nPlease note: descriptive studies that report responses of growth, yield, or quality to biostimulant treatments will not be considered if they do not progress physiological understanding of these responses.\\nKeywords: humic substances, protein hydrolysates, silicon, arbuscular mycorrhiza, plant growth promoting rhizobacteria, macroalgae, microalgae, abiotic stresses, nutrient use efficiency, physiological mechanisms, plant-microbiome\\nImportant Note: All contributions to this Research Topic must be within the scope of the section and journal to which they are submitted, as defined in their mission statements.

By synthesizing the highly symbolic, esoteric systems of the Tarot, Kabbala and Alchemy, not as an academic study but rather as a way of experiencing our daily life, we can understand more clearly the nature of this change. The most sacred text of the alchemist, the Emerald Tablet of Hermes, is no less than an alchemist’s opus, a recipe for the second creation of the world. It begins:\\n“True, without falsehood, certain and most true,\\nthat which is above is as that which is below\\nand that which is below is as that which is above\\nfor the performance of the miracles of the One Thing…”\\nWhen we truly know the meaning of this text we can fully comprehend the unity of mind, body and spirit in the souls of human beings.\\nThe lecture will discuss the fundamental basis of Alchemy as interpereted by Carl Jung, and the principles of the Tarot and the Hermetic Kabbala. The by looking at the images presented by men and women from thier dreams, body experiences and synchronistic events, we will see how these esoteric mysteries are present in everyday life.\\nWorkshop: Metaphor and symbols are the great transformers, the bridge between the levels of mind, body, and spirit. This psychological understanding of the Alchemical opus will provide the container and the integrity to lead into the Saturday workshop, which will be directly experiential and allow individuals to have an opportunity to experience the working of the alchemical process within their own bodies.\\nThe Eugene program will lead directly into the program presented in Portland the following weekend. The final work of the opus is the conjunctio, the union of opposites. The social manifestation of this final alchemical process is the changing images in the relationships between men and women.

       " {'text': 'As a personal injury attorney, you’re tasked with making difficult decisions every day: Should I take on this client? Should we take this to trial? Should we ask for more money or settle? Is that tuna sandwich at the bodega downstairs ok to eat? It’s a constant battle wherein you’re forced to balance risk vs. reward on the daily—weighing factors such as time, money, effort, and, in the case of the tuna sandwich, your health. But what about the health of your personal injury law firm security?\\nYour law firm’s security isn’t something you should mess around with. A single data breach can cripple your firm’s overall health—leading to a loss of reputation, goodwill, and business…after all, your main duty as an attorney is to protect your clients’ interests, and losing their confidential matter data is not exactly a great way to do that. The question remains then: why do you continue to use archaic security standards/“tech” (e.g., onsite servers, Bankers Boxes), instead of modern cloud-based legal document management for your clients’ data?\\nWell, whatever the excuse, we’re here to dispel those reasons and show you how you can beef up your data security by switching to cloud-based matter management software. Whether you’re a small law firm or a giant one, you’re taking big risks by failing to upgrade your information security to the cloud:\\nYou’re risking a data breach\\nThe whole point of taking increased cybersecurity measures is to ensure your clients’ data is safe; but with onsite systems, you’re not getting the best security tools, frequent backups, effective disaster recovery measures, and more. Instead, with local servers, the onus is on you—you’re one unpatched vulnerability away from begging hackers to steal your matter info and ruin your reputation.\\nYou’re risking significant losses of time and money\\nYou might think upgrading your data management will cost you more than just sticking with what you have, but cyber security professionals would advise otherwise. On-site systems take a lot of money and staff to maintain—and frequent crashes and repairs lead to lots of downtime for your productivity…not to mention the cost of a breach or the fines associated with failing to comply with compliance standards (which is often a challenge for obsolete software).\\nYou’re risking inefficiency\\nIf you’re using old, outdated software, your productivity is likely to suffer. On-site software can be buggy, slow, and impossible to integrate with your favorite productivity legal tech apps—thereby rendering them “unproductivity” apps…combine that with a higher probability for breach and you’re looking at a lot of downtime, down employees, and down profits.\\nSo how do you secure your clients’ data and your firm’s future?\\nWe’ve already told you: the answer is in the cloud…no not that cloud, down here. Storing your firm’s sensitive and confidential info in the cloud is the best way to eliminate security risks for your firm and protect your clients’ best interests. But not all clouds are the same…\\nCloudLex’s next-gen cloud-based personal injury case management system protects your firm’s sensitive information from data breach. We have state-of-the-art cybersecurity features built into our platform (e.g., application-level security, strong password protection, automatic backups), and we’re hosted on top-tier Microsoft Azure servers, so your data is subject to continuous monitoring—allowing you to remain vigilant, even when you’re asleep. And since cloud documents aren’t affected by the elements, your firm won’t skip a beat should a natural disaster strike.\\nAnd you can avoid a natural disaster for your firm by signing up for a free demo of our revolutionary cloud-based legal platform. Do it now so you can secure peace of mind with our airtight cybersecurity precautions and efficiency with our all-in-one cloud platform designed for your personal injury needs.',\n",

Each day this week we will focus on one of those statements and what it means for us.\\nChrist is the “heir of all things.” Prophets were sent to speak to God’s people. They brought important news and teachings from God, but they were merely messengers. Now God has come and has spoken to his people directly through his Son, who is the “heir of all things.”\\nThis reference points back to Psalm 2:7-8, which says, “He said to me, ‘You are my son; today I have become your father. Ask me, and I will make the nations your inheritance, the ends of the earth your possession.’” In Jesus, God fulfills this amazing promise.\\nJesus is the heir who receives all that the Father has. Peter says that this inheritance “can never perish, spoil or fade. This inheritance is kept in heaven for you” (1 Peter 1:4).\\nSo what does this mean for us? As followers of Christ, we are adopted into God’s family as his children, and we are “co-heirs with Christ” (Romans 8:17). As co-heirs with Christ, we are set to inherit all that Christ inherits — namely, salvation from sin and eternal life with him.\\nLord, you promise us the rich inheritance of eternal life with you. Help us to keep our eyes focused on Christ, our brother. Amen.',\n",

       " {'text': 'There’s been a wave of Twitter chats recently around favourite bad films (Kong: Skull Island), unpopular opinions (The Lion King is mediocre animal Hamlet with mostly bad tunes) and the like. It’s a great platform for the random and reactionary. But one film kept bafflingly coming up as a “guilty pleasure” with astonishing regularity: Practical Magic.\\nNow, we all know why that is. We know that it doesn’t actually matter on any level whether it’s a good romantic comedy or not (it is), if the script is smart (mostly), the performances are on point (yup) or the structure makes sense (eh, more or less). What matters is that it’s a women’s film, and we can easily dismiss womeny things that men couldn’t possibly be interested in like love and magic and, um, being beaten and strangled by your insane abusive ex. Actually, it really is a women’s film.\\nPractical Magic is the best examination of womanhood and patriarchy that ever masqueraded as a fuzzy love story. It starts with a botched hanging and a ruined woman’s curse and takes a left turn through young widowhood, manslaughter and demonic possession. Through all of it is the constant support that women offer other women. It’s the sister who drives through the night to hold your hand, tell you stories and remind you that your breath stinks so you can maybe, eventually get out of bed. And it’s her in return racing to collect you and soothe your bruises; it’s her knowing where the bodies are buried. It’s the in-jokes and rituals and thousand little hurts that only bind you closer together.\\nAnd when the ghost of a terrible relationship literally won’t let you go, it’s the sister who rallies the crowd, won’t let go and puts blood, sweat and tears into saving your soul from darkness.\\nIt’s not faultless; what film is? If I had to pick a feminist hole, it would be in the portrayal of Gillian whose own, deeply sexual power isn’t exactly blamed for the disaster she finds herself in, but is definitely cast in an unflattering light next to the repressed spark of Sally’s more pure magic. The hint that she’s slowly passing into a boho wyrd sister role with the elder aunts is a little irritating; but since they still indulge in midnight margaritas, naked dancing under the moon and bird-stabbing love life magic, it’s not exactly a peaceful retirement. Like Marianne and Elinor Dashwood, Gillian and Sally are at their best when they accept themselves as they are, instead of – respectively – as they dream of being or as they think they should be.\\nThere’s nothing to feel guilty about in loving a film that appeals to the power of the female collective to heal hearts broken by relationships with men. Whether it’s a beautiful relationship doomed by death before its time or a deeply unbalanced one riven with male violence, the balm in the end is the fellowship of other women.\\nIndeed, even if it were as fluffy as the Faith Hill banger that accompanies it, you can jettison any thoughts that this makes it unworthy of your time and attention. Even if it’s the most womany thing of all the womany things – especially if it is, in fact – you can like what you like without feeling the need to justify it.\\nUnless it’s I Just Can’t Wait To Be King.',\n",

       " {'text': 'I’ve been in school more than three quarters of my life. That’s a long time. It really starts to wear on a person’s spirit, being in school that long. I love learning. It is a beautiful, wonderful thing. I just do not like school. The longer I am in it, the less I enjoy being a student. Thus, when I met with an academic adviser last semester and discovered that, I thought, I would be able to graduate after just one more year, I was thrilled. It was like being in a long, dark tunnel, and finally seeing the light at the end, knowing you’re going to make it out soon.\\nToday, I discovered that I have two more years of school. This is because I’m getting my teaching credential, so in addition to taking prerequisites and finishing my bachelor’s degree next year, I have to do the credential program the year after that.\\nThat news wrecked my day. Like when you’re on a long road trip and you think, after days of being in the car, that you’re almost there, only to discover that you’ve got twice as far to go as you expected. My will to do my homework snapped. My frustration with school boiled over. My spirits plummeted down faster than the pull of gravity.\\nTonight, I had Bible study with my amazing friends. In the conversation, it somehow came up that one of my friends said as an example, “Look at what happened with Beth’s schooling. She went to community college for two years, then God called her to go to Biola (which was my dream school) for a year, then He called her to transfer to a Cal State. Listen to her stories–in each place, she was so blessed.”\\nIt’s true. I had forgotten. This did happen, and in each stage of the journey, God blessed me and grew me enormously. Even more, He used me in the lives of different people who I never would have met had I not gone where He led. Aside from frustrations with schoolwork and a couple of less-than-pleasant teachers, these past years have been blessed, indeed.

He has a plan for your life, and for the lives of everyone around you, just as Ninevah was the best place for Jonah to go, despite his wishes.

Spanning over 5,000 square metres, it will feature four EV charging points and 16 refuelling positions, and will be pressed into service by June 30.\\n“This sees Shell become the first mobility solution provider in Hong Kong to offer an inclusive EV charging network, with charging facilities in both car parks and gas and oil stations, to meet a wide range of customer demands,” the company said in a statement.\\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world?

It also aims to grow its global EV charging network to more than 500,000 charging points by 2025, including those on its own sites and those at third-party locations.\\nThe new station at Hong Kong’s airport showed Shell’s commitment to the city’s decarbonisation journey, said Emily Leung, general manager of mobility at Shell Hong Kong. “We will continue to work with the government and other stakeholders to realise the city’s goal of net-zero carbon emissions by continuing to grow our EV charging network,” she said in the statement.\\nThe Hong Kong government is stepping up policy support to boost the take-up of emissions-free vehicles, including subsidies for EV purchases and private charging infrastructure.\\nThis policy support forms part of the city’s efforts to become carbon-neutral by 2050 and fight climate change. The city also wants to eliminate coal-fired power generation and for renewable energy to contribute up to 10 per cent of its total electricity output by 2035.\\nThe government last year set a target for the city to have more than 150,000 private charging facilities and more than 5,000 public ones by 2025. Hong Kong currently has about 4,500 charging points.\\nIn October 2020, it launched a HK$2 billion (US$803 million) scheme to subsidise charging infrastructure installation for more than 60,000 parking spaces in existing private residential buildings.

Wellbeing authorities have said it\\'s inescapable that America will see a flare-up of COVID-19, the novel coronavirus that was first detailed in Wuhan, China, and has since spread to in excess of 60 nations, tainting in excess of 88,000 individuals up until now.\\nAs it keeps on spreading, it\\'s insufficient for wellbeing authorities to encourage individuals to work remotely or self-isolate on the off chance that they show influenza like manifestations. A fair reaction to coronavirus needs to consider the foundational issues—and the helpless populaces those issues make—that could shield a few people from getting treatment.\\nWHO GETS TREATED?\\nWe\\'ve just perceived how pandemics can intensify differences. The 2014 Ebola episode fundamentally influenced low-pay nations that didn\\'t approach adequate wellbeing framework or instruction assets. Not exclusively were those effectively distraught populaces excessively influenced by the infection, the nations were considerably additionally hindered in light of the millions they spent on regulation and recuperation (Sierra Leone burned through $67 million on medicinal services and malady alleviation), the hits to their financial development from exchange decreases, and the impact of high wellbeing laborer passings on an effectively deficient social insurance framework.\\nInside the United States, the privatized medicinal services framework implies that on the off chance that you figure you may have contracted COVID-19, you probably won\\'t have the option to manage the cost of the test that affirms that, or the days off important to keep you from tainting others. A Florida inhabitant who went to a medical clinic for coronavirus testing when he had influenza like side effects in the wake of going back from China got a $3,000 note. New York state, in any event, has found a way to forestall this; Governor Andrew Cuomo declared an order this week requiring New York wellbeing safety net providers to postpone cost-sharing for coronavirus testing, including crisis room, critical consideration, and office facilities. (The Trump organization is allegedly considering a comparable national proposition.)\\nThe real procedure of testing in the U.S. has additionally experienced harsh criticism for tight limitations on who meets all requirements for a test and how restricted the CDC has been in its testing limit (however that seems, by all accounts, to be evolving). Difference this to South Korea, where \"drive-through\" coronavirus testing offices are available to people in general and take under 10 minutes; the nation can process 10,000 tests per day.\\nIn any case, a fair reaction to coronavirus goes significantly farther than access to testing. In an open letter to Vice-President Mike Pence and other government, state, and neighborhood pioneers from the American Civil Liberties Union, in excess of 450 general wellbeing and lawful specialists illustrated fundamental components to a reasonable, and compelling, COVID-19 reaction.\\nSecuring THE UNINSURED\\n\"Perhaps the best test ahead is to ensure that the weights of COVID-19, and our reaction measures, don\\'t fall unreasonably on individuals in the public arena who are powerless in view of their financial, social, or wellbeing status,\" they compose. The degree of a U.S. coronavirus episode, they include, relies upon four key things: satisfactory subsidizing, moderation of open dread, reasonable administration of what will be a flooding human services request, and the vital assets for a reasonable control of the contamination.\\nGovernment subsidizing is vital to dealing with a general wellbeing concern, and not just as far as the financing for COVID-19 explicit assets, for example, testing. \"It must be new finances that don\\'t rip apart the current emotionally supportive networks that are basic to our general\\'s wellbeing in the long haul,\" said Yale University law educator Amy Kapczynski on a press call facilitated by the ACLU concerning the open letter. \"It\\'s likewise important that significant legislative exercises are not interfered, particularly those that secure the powerless. Government needs an arrangement at all levels to organize basic administrations and backing to the general population, for instance, to guarantee that Social Security and vet benefits keep on being given.\"\\nIt\\'s likewise significant that authorities empower people in general to follow their proposals for care and counteraction activities, and a major piece of that is ensuring social insurance offices are movement implementation free zones. \"There\\'s been a wide number of reports in the course of the most recent couple of long periods of settlers and individuals in blended status networks previous social insurance, staying away from specialists and emergency clinics before this flare-up,\" said educator Wendy Parmet, Center for Health Policy and Law Director at Northeastern University, who likewise marked the ACLU open letter. \"On the off chance that that pattern were to keep during the flare-up, it would have outcomes not just for the people themselves, yet additionally for the more prominent general wellbeing.\" Immigrants likewise make up a huge extent of the workforce, especially in places like nursing homes, so ensuring that open methods securing the individuals who care for them.\\nThe U.S. human services framework is \"not especially very much set up to managing a pandemic,\" she stated, and to separate protection and cost boundaries to wellbeing access, the specialists encourage policymakers to work legitimately with insurance agencies to guarantee reasonable access, in any event, for the individuals who are uninsured, much like what New York has initiated. The New York order doesn\\'t legitimately make reference to the uninsured, yet notes that New Yorkers getting Medicaid won\\'t be relied upon to pay a co-pay for any COVID-19-related testing.\\nMAKING IT AFFORDABLE TO CALL IN SICK\\nThose proposals to general society to remain at home from work or self-isolate if wiped out likewise should be upheld by a thorough arrangement that incorporates social and financial help, so as to make those choices really accessible to all. \"The individuals who need to self-detach or care for wiped out relatives or children remaining at self-teach won\\'t have the option to do this without satisfactory pay support,\" Kapczynski said. \"We have to guide assets to people to permit them to help out the general wellbeing reaction.\"\\nIn Washington state—one of the hardest hit in the U.S., where in any event nine individuals have passed on from COVID-19 up until this point—not-for-profit Working Washington has laid out what managers and government authorities can do to secure help laborers who regularly can\\'t take debilitated time. They\\'re approaching bosses to defer strategies that require a specialist\\'s note and permit representatives to \"go negative\" on wiped out time, and on the state to end the overabundance for preparing paid family and clinical leave claims and make those advantages quickly open to laborers, particularly the individuals who need to remain at home to think about children during school abrogations.\\nUp until this point, however, the U.S. is by all accounts lacking such assets. After Walmart discharged a notice to all U.S. stores that prominent the CDC suggestion to remain at home if wiped out, Walmart representatives said that they\\'re hesitant to utilize their debilitated time since they could be terminated or lose the opportunity at a future reward. \"Notwithstanding the coronavirus, we\\'re concerned that Walmart\\'s corrective wiped out time strategy will prompt individuals coming to work when they\\'re infectious,\" United for Respect pioneer and Walmart worker Melissa Love said in an announcement. The MTA is banishing travel laborers from wearing covers, and however covers aren\\'t prescribed as a deterrent measure, the choice to evacuate that choice has baffled workers who need the alternative, and who don\\'t feel the organization has their wellbeing as a primary concern.\\nDifferent nations are taking, and have recently taken, progressively extensive measures: Hong Kong authorities vowed HK$25 billion (more than $3 billion) in real money freebees to organizations and helpless gatherings influenced by the coronavirus episode. With schools shut in Japan, Prime Minister Shino Abe pledged to give endowments to help working guardians care for their children. During the 2003 SARS flare-up in Canada, the legislature gave loss of pay remuneration to the individuals who must be isolated or needed to miss work to think about somebody with SARS.\\nIndeed, even with help, there will at present be powerless populaces, for the most part those living nearby other people, from nursing homes to detainment facilities. \"We ought to consider not just how to adequately control transmission and treat individuals who are imprisoned, yet how to get our policing strategies to help general wellbeing, perceiving, for instance, that prisons can help intensify a pandemic,\" Kapczynski said.\\nAlso, all through each activity, it\\'s significant authorities don\\'t stir any scapegoating. Early reports of the coronavirus connected a dread of the malady to why Chinese eateries were losing business. In Korea, one strict order, the Shincheonji church, has been at the focal point of the episode, and that shame has kept a few people from looking for testing. Pandemics have a background marked by separation and that shame can follow defenseless networks.

       " {'text': 'Chris Mullin is a former Labour MP and minister, and the author of Error of Judgment: The Truth about the Birmingham Bombings. The Friends of Harry Perkins, a sequel to his novel A Very British Coup, is published next month.\\nOn the evening of 21 November 1974, bombs planted by the IRA in two crowded Birmingham pubs, the Tavern in the Town and the Mulberry Bush, exploded, killing 21 people and injuring at least 170. Many of the injuries were life-changing. None of those responsible has been brought to justice.\\nThis month, almost 45 years later, an inquest opens into the deaths. The inquest has been forced on the authorities by the persistence of a small group of bereaved relatives who want to know who made the bombs and who planted them. The coroner has resisted this demand, arguing that it is not the job of an inquest to identify perpetrators. The relatives challenged his decision in the courts: the police, they say, know the names of those responsible and should be obliged to disclose them. The police respond that, although they have their suspicions, they have insufficient evidence to charge anyone. The lower court refused to order the coroner to address the issue, but did conclude that he hadn’t properly considered the matter and referred it back to him. The coroner stuck to his original decision. The relatives then took their case to the appeal court, which found for the coroner. There the matter rests.\\nI know the names of the bombers. Four men were involved: two bomb-makers and two planters. More than thirty years ago two of them described to me what they’d done in some detail. By a process of elimination, assisted by information from former members of the West Midlands IRA, I also identified at least one of the remaining perpetrators, perhaps both, though neither would admit to me their role in the bombings. But I have never named names. Journalists do not disclose their sources. I interviewed many of those who were active in the IRA’s West Midlands campaign. To gain their co-operation I gave repeated assurances, not only to the guilty, but to innocent intermediaries, that I would not disclose their identities. I cannot go back on that now, just because it would be convenient. My purpose at the time was to help free the six innocent men who had been convicted of the bombing. I was never under the illusion that I could bring the perpetrators to justice. My researches, conducted between 1985 and 1987, formed the final chapters of my book about the case, Error of Judgment. In it two of the perpetrators are quoted at length, but not identified. I no longer have any compunction about identifying two of the men involved, who are now dead (I am about to do so), but the man described in my book as the ‘young planter’ is still alive, and I will not name him.\\nWithin four hours of the explosions on 21 November five Irishmen – Paddy Hill, Gerry Hunter, Richard McIlkenny, Billy Power and Johnny Walker – were arrested at Heysham in Lancashire as they got off a train from Birmingham New Street which connected with the ferry to Belfast. A sixth man, Hughie Callaghan, was arrested the next day in Birmingham. The five were taken to Morecambe police station where Dr Frank Skuse, a Home Office forensic scientist, tested their hands for evidence of contact with explosives. Meanwhile a posse of detectives from the West Midlands Serious Crimes Squad headed up the motorway to interview the suspects. In Morecambe Skuse conducted a Griess test, swabbing the hands of the suspects with ether, mixing it with caustic soda and noting the reaction. By dawn, he was claiming that the test had returned positive results for two of the five prisoners. He had no business making such a claim. Griess was only a screening test. Having obtained his initial results, he should have taken the samples back to his laboratory in Preston and fed them into a mass spectrometer, which gives a much more accurate result. Instead, Skuse told the West Midlands detectives he was certain at least two of the suspects had recently been in contact with nitroglycerine. From that moment, their fate was sealed.\\nUp to this point Lancashire police had resisted pressure from the West Midlands detectives to hand over the suspects for interrogation. After Skuse’s contribution the pressure became impossible to resist. Lancashire police effectively lost control of their police station and a programme of violence and intimidation began, lasting three days and two nights (during which time the prisoners were transferred to Queens Road police station in Birmingham), which resulted in four confessions. This was before the Police and Criminal Evidence Act (1984), which laid down strict rules for the treatment of suspects. Before its passage, confessions could be extracted by any means necessary, so long as any injuries inflicted weren’t too obvious. There were no tape or video recordings, no lawyer present, just police officers. The suspects who confessed claimed they did so after being beaten and deprived of sleep, having aggressive dogs put in their cells and, in one case, being subjected to a mock execution using blank cartridges.\\nThe confessions were mistaken in details about the bombings and contradicted each other in major respects. Among the things they got wrong were the locations of the bombs, the types of bag they were carried in (something which only became apparent after scientists examined remnants found in the rubble, by which time it was too late to correct the confessions), and which suspects were supposed to have bombed which pub. They didn’t explain where the bombs had come from or who had made them. (Years later, at the Birmingham Six’s final, successful appeal in 1991, it was discovered that the interviewing officers had been rewriting their supposedly contemporaneous notebooks up to the day the original trial started.)\\nThe trial took place at Lancaster Castle in the summer of 1975. Mr Justice (later Lord) Bridge made no secret of his approach to the evidence. ‘I am of the opinion,’ he told the jury, ‘not shared by all my brothers on the bench that, if a judge has formed a clear view, it is much better to let the jury see that and say so and not pretend to be some Olympian detached observer.’ He was as good as his word. The trial lasted 45 days. In addition to the six, there were three other people in the dock, charged with conspiracy to cause explosions. One of them was Michael Murray, a workmate of two of the six, who made no secret of his membership of the IRA. In the best IRA tradition he chose not to participate in the proceedings. His presence in the dock alongside the six was deeply damaging to their case. This is no doubt the reason the prosecution decided to try them together.\\nThe case against the six was divided into what the judge called three chapters. The first was circumstantial evidence: they were in the wrong place at the wrong time and drank in the same pubs and clubs as a number of the wrong people. Even Bridge admitted that this ‘fell a long way short of anything that anyone could possibly regard as proof’. The two remaining chapters were the confessions and Skuse’s evidence. Skuse told the court, as he had told the police officers, that he was ‘99 per cent certain’ at least two of the accused had handled explosives.\\nThere were clear difficulties with the prosecution case. The confessions were riddled with contradictions and the suggestion that they had been obtained by intimidation and violence could not be entirely dismissed – no one disputed that the men had suffered numerous injuries during their first few days in custody. The police position was that the injuries must have been inflicted after the suspects were remanded to Winson Green prison. The prison officers’ position was silence. The men’s position was that they had been assaulted both at the police station and at the prison. The distinction was important because if it could be demonstrated that the assaults had occurred in police custody the confessions would be invalid. A long procession of police officers ranging in rank from detective constable to chief superintendent gave evidence that no one had laid a finger on the suspects. In his summing up the judge outlined, in tones of incredulity, the scale of the conspiracy the police would have to have engaged in if the defendants were telling the truth. We now know that a conspiracy on this scale is essentially what did occur.\\nThere were problems, too, with the evidence provided by Skuse. After applying the Griess test to the men’s hands at Morecambe, he did what he should have done before giving the police his conclusion and went back to his laboratory to feed the samples into a mass spectrometer. They all tested negative. What’s more, the clothes of all six men tested negative and a search of their homes revealed no trace of explosives. Where the bombs came from was a mystery left unexplored. Nevertheless, Skuse stuck to his assertion that the two positive Griess tests were proof of recent contact with explosives. Dr Hugh Black, a former Home Office chief inspector of explosives, appearing as a witness for the defence, pointed out that a range of innocent substances – anything containing nitrocellulose – could produce a positive Griess test. The problem was that Black was relying solely on his knowledge of chemistry. He had conducted no tests to support his (entirely accurate) assertions. The judge pounced on this.\\nThroughout the trial Bridge lost no opportunity to intervene on behalf of the prosecution. Not only did he criticise Black for failing to conduct experiments, he also went for the prison medical officer, Dr Harwood, whose evidence inconveniently asserted that the defendants showed signs of injury when they arrived at Winson Green. Harwood’s problem was that he was trying to cover for what Bridge called ‘his cronies’ in the prison service by making out all the assaults had been carried out by the police. Bridge took him apart. Finally, there was a tricky moment when one of the Lancashire police officers strayed off-script on a key issue of timing. Under questioning from the prosecution, he stuck to his story. Eventually the judge rode to the rescue.\\nBridge’s summing up covered 189 pages and took three days to deliver. It is peppered with heavy hints as to his view of the evidence, although he always took care to insert the sentence, ‘Members of the jury, it is entirely a matter for you.’ One of the most remarkable passages came towards the end, when Bridge turned to Michael Murray, who had sat silently throughout the proceedings. ‘You may think,’ he told the jury, ‘that Murray’s conduct in this trial has shown a certain measure of dignity totally absent from the conduct of his co-defendants. You may find yourself in difficulty in withholding a certain measure of respect.’ Murray, as it turned out, was the only person in that courtroom who actually had anything to do with the bombings.\\nMy attention was first drawn to the Birmingham case by my friend Peter Chippendale, who covered the trial for the Guardian. He told me he thought the wrong people had been convicted. It was ten years or so before I began to investigate the matter. In the early 1980s I persuaded Carmen Callil at Chatto and Windus to commission a book on the case, but the advance was small and did not begin to fund the research necessary. In 1985, Ray Fitzwalter, the editor of ITV’s documentary series World in Action, agreed to take me on temporarily and give me the resources to look into the case.\\nTo begin with, I spent much time, along with the World in Action journalists Ian McBride and Charles Tremayne, trying to find a police officer involved in the case who would tell a story different from the one told in court. The search proved fruitless. Next we got two independent forensic scientists to test Skuse’s evidence. They found, just as Black had suggested during the trial, that a range of innocent household substances containing nitrocellulose, from varnish to sprays, could produce a positive Griess test. Of particular interest was the discovery that packs of playing cards used to be coated with nitrocellulose. The five men on the train to Heysham had played cards during the journey. We got Ian McBride to shuffle a pack of old playing cards and, sure enough, his hands produced a positive Griess test. With that, the forensic evidence collapsed. Soon after a World in Action documentary describing our findings was shown in October 1985, I was contacted by a former police officer who had been at Queens Road police station and witnessed some of the comings and goings in the cell block. We made a second documentary.\\nThe case against the six men had always been weak, but that in itself did not prove their innocence. The only way to do that was to track down the actual bombers. My colleagues were not immediately interested in this line of inquiry so I went about it alone, beginning with a visit to the Sinn Féin leader Gerry Adams in July 1985. I didn’t expect him to deliver up the real bombers; I wanted him to indicate that he had no objection to my interviewing particular individuals, whose names I would put to him. I wanted especially to talk to Michael Murray, who, having served most of his 12-year sentence for conspiracy to cause explosions, had recently been released and was living in Dublin.\\nMurray was not at all keen to meet me, but agreed after the intervention of intermediaries. We agreed that I would not disclose his identity and that when we came to a question he didn’t want to answer he would say so, but not mislead me. I met him three times, in July and November 1985 and April 1986. The first interview lasted three hours. Despite his initial reluctance he provided an account of what happened on the night of the bombings. Two men had made the bombs and two others had planted them in the pubs. The targets had not been the pubs, but the buildings they were part of: one was in the Rotunda, a local landmark, and the other was underneath the New Street office of the Inland Revenue.\\nAt that meeting Murray declined to discuss his own role, but at our second meeting he was frank. He was one of the men who had made the bombs and he had given the warning phone call (which had come too late). This still wasn’t enough to free the jailed men. The police never claimed to have caught the bomb-makers. Indeed they had never offered any explanation as to where the bombs came from. I had to find one or both of the planters and persuade them to describe what they had done in such detail that it wouldn’t be possible for anyone to go on pretending that the right people were in prison.\\nI drew up a list of all those known to have been involved in planting bombs in and around Birmingham. Tracking them down wasn’t too difficult since many of them had served long prison terms. I started with those who’d been in prison at the time of the pub bombings. They didn’t necessarily know the identity of the bombers, but they did know which members of the West Midlands IRA were at liberty that night. They all agreed on one point: none of the Birmingham Six had been a member of the IRA.\\nI then began to track down those members of the West Midlands IRA who had been at liberty on the night of the bombings. Gradually I narrowed down my list of suspects and when I had been given the same name by three separate sources, I moved in on him. He lived on a bleak housing estate and was in his early thirties. He had been involved in seven or eight other city-centre bombings before the pub bombings. He set out to give me a sanitised version of his career, but as we started discussing the night of 21 November his voice began to tremble and fade away. At first, he lied, saying he had been warned to stay at home that night because something big was going to happen. After we changed the subject his voice grew stronger again. ‘I think you were in the pubs,’ I said to him. There was a long silence. We were sitting on the floor. He stared straight ahead, smoking. Then it all came tumbling out. This is what he told me:\\nOn the evening of the bombings a person came to see me and said, ‘You’re needed for an operation.’ I went with him to a house. We went by car. The bombs were in the parlour, behind the sofa. One was in a duffle bag and the other was in a small brown luggage case. I was given the duffle bag and a pistol. I put the gun in my coat pocket. The other man carried the case. We walked into town. It was a good mile. The other fellow told me the targets ten minutes before we arrived. He said: ‘The one in the Tavern is for the tax office and the one in the Mulberry Bush is for the Rotunda.’ He added: ‘There’ll be plenty of warning.’ Believe it or not I accepted it. I didn’t want the stigma of cowardice attached to me. He kept saying, ‘Don’t worry, those people will be well out of there.’ I kept on about it and he repeated there would be substantial warning.\\nWe approached down Digbeth. Just before we arrived we stopped in the entrance to a row of shops. The other guy opened the case and was fiddling with something. Then he reached inside my duffle bag. That was when the bombs were primed. We crossed the road without using the underpass because the police were sometimes down there. We did the Tavern first. Up New Street. Past the Mulberry Bush. The other fellow went to the bar and ordered two drinks. I took both bags and found a seat. I was shitting myself. The other person came back with the drinks. We took a sip and then got up leaving the duffle bag under a seat.\\nAt the Mulberry Bush the procedure was the same. ‘This time I ordered the drinks. The other person found a table at the back. The bomb was left by a telephone.’ We talked for nearly four hours. I pressed him repeatedly for the name of the other man, but he refused to tell me. As I left, he said: ‘No offence Mr Mullin, but I never want to see you again.’\\nI learned from other sources that the other planter was called James Francis Gavin. It was from his house in Bordesley Green that the bombers had set out. By the time I was told about him, Gavin was in Portlaoise Prison, near Dublin, serving life for a murder committed in 1977. A pipe layer by profession, he was married to an English woman, served in the British army for three years and lived in Britain for many more. During the course of my three-hour interview with him he readily admitted to his involvement in the IRA’s West Midlands campaign and even to having advised IRA units all over the country about the layout of British military bases. When it came to the pub bombings, however, he flatly denied involvement. Instead he doggedly suggested that the bombings were the work of British agents bent on discrediting the IRA – something the IRA had never alleged. His reasons for this became clear as the interview progressed.\\nIn the immediate aftermath of the pub bombings the IRA had issued a statement saying that it was not its policy to kill civilians; there would be an internal inquiry and the results of it would be published, ‘however unpalatable’. There was an inquiry, but the results were never published. I later interviewed an IRA veteran who sat on the inquiry. ‘A lot of lies were told,’ he said. ‘The people who had come out of England were interviewed. They all said, “It wasn’t us.” I firmly believed them at the time. Eighteen months later I was sitting in the house of one of the people who had been active in Birmingham. People had had a few drinks and they started talking. It became clear that we had done it. A second inquiry was held. It concluded that we had been lied to and that the people who had done it were walking around free.’\\nMichael Murray had confessed to being one of the bomb-makers. Gavin, even if he hadn’t admitted it to me, and the young man I spoke to had planted the bombs. A fourth name crops up from time to time: Michael Christopher Hayes, who was active in the West Midlands IRA in 1974 and returned to Ireland some time in 1975, remaining active there. Sean O’Callaghan, who infiltrated the IRA as an agent of the Irish security service, identified him as the one-time ‘quartermaster’ of the IRA English operation. According to another knowledgeable source he was its deputy head during the 1980s and so would have been involved in planning all the bombings that took place on the British mainland in that period. That would include the Brighton bombing of 1984. I interviewed him in October 1987. Like Gavin, he admitted to a leading role in the IRA’s West Midlands campaign, but denied involvement in the pub bombings. Lately, however, he has become more talkative. In Dublin in 2017 he gave an interview to a BBC journalist in which he accepted ‘collective responsibility’ for the bombings, but again denied direct involvement. He also made the unlikely claim that he had defused a third bomb in Birmingham that night: it had been left in the doorway of a branch of Barclays Bank in Hagley Road but failed to go off. This may or may not be true, but it does confirm he was active that night.\\nMichael Murray died in 1999, James Francis Gavin in 2002. Michael Christopher Hayes remains at liberty in Ireland. So does the young planter. Remarkably, they all spent time in West Midlands police custody after the bombings. The Birmingham Six were finally freed in 1991.',\n",

       " {'text': 'Seeking the northern boundary of the Cascade strawberry\\nFragaria cascadensis K.E. Hummer, an endemic decaploid strawberry species, was described from the Oregon Cascade Mountains in the Pacific North-western United States. Its range occurs near Mt. Hood, the highest peak in the northern Oregon Cascades, in a band of higher elevation sites southwards to near Crater Lake in southern Oregon. The objective of this study was to examine in more detail, the distribution of this species at the northern end of its range. During summer and fall 2015, several excursions were taken in the vicinity of Mt. Hood to seek the wild distribution of Fragaria species. These excursions encircled the mountain by road and hiking. The most northerly observation of the occurrence of F. cascadensis was at Lolo Pass near the junction of the Pacific Crest Trail (PCT) and Route 18; the highest elevation occurrence was observed on Mt. Hood, 2 miles south of Timberline Lodge at 1589 m (5213RSQUO). Interestingly, the region to the east of the PCT and north of Hood, was populated with octoploid strawberries, Fragaria virginiana ssp. platypetala. This region included the Cooper Spur Recreational Area. The decaploid F. cascadensis was not observed in the north to northeast sector of the mountain. While the diploid F. vesca spp. bracteata (A. Heller) Staudt was present at the PCT at Cascade Locks near the Columbia River, no higher ploidy species were observed in that vicinity.

These days, the humble plant is most well-known (and commonly used) for its stress-relieving effects. But, that’s not all this centuries-old botanical can do.\\nIn recent years, ashwagandha has been shown in human studies to improve athletic performance, cardiovascular health, and testosterone levels. To this list, you can also add weight loss and body recomposition!\\nAn 8-week study involving 52 men and women found that individuals consuming 300mg of KSM-66 ashwagandha twice per day experienced a 3.0% reduction in bodyweight as well as a 2.9% decline in body mass index (BMI).\\nFurthermore, the study participants receiving KSM-66 also experienced an average reduction in perceived stress of 32.74% as well as a 22% decrease in average serum cortisol levels from the baseline compared to placebo group.\\nChronic stress (i.e. chronically elevated cortisol levels) are known to adversely impact quality of life in multiple ways, including:\\nEssentially, everything you don’t want to happen at a physiological level (from a body composition and healthy standpoint) does happen when you’re stressed all of the time. Furthermore, previous research also finds a relationship between individuals with higher levels of cortisol and larger weights, higher BMI, and greater body weights.\\nAs an adaptogen, ashwagandha can help improve how you perceive, interact, and recover from stress. This ultimately can help you lose weight, build muscle, and improve overall health and body composition from multiple angles. When you’re less stressed, you’ll feel more energized and motivated to exercise, less prone to cravings and overeating, and get better sleep — all of which support performance, recovery, and weight loss!\\nAshwagandha is a natural and safe supplement to help reduce stress, boost performance, support weight loss, and improve body composition. KSM-66 is the premier ashwagandha extract available, supplying the highest concentration, most bioavailable full-spectrum root extract on the market today, It retains all the natural constituents of the herb in the original balance, and KSM-66 is backed by over 20 human clinical trials — more than any other ashwagandha extract!',\n",

Here is one they left behind. And here is one below they capped with a geo-textile membrane- any bird mortality here?\\nVarious sub divisions in the UK were in operation, with a familiar story at many of them. The aquisition of AW meant that the Langley factory became part of their “consumer specialties” – basically the same stuff they had been making as Albright and Wilson but with a different logo. The main business at Trinity Street remained Phosphorus performance derivatives (PPD).\\nChemicals produced included organic phosphites, organic phosphates, organic alkylphosphonates, acid phosphates and organic pyrophosphoric acids. The starting blocks for all of these chemicals remains white phosphorus ( which is stored on site) together with phosphorus trichloride (PCl3), phosphorus oxychloride (POCl3) and phosphorus pentoxide (p205).\\nRhodia consistently attempted to deny that there was anything harmful in the lagoon in the press, and that the deaths of birds were not as a result of their activities.\\nRhodia maintained their satellite chemical toilet waste facility at Rattlechain, disposing of waste at the lagoon by Road tanker upto March 2006 whereby they no longer chose to continue this form of waste disposal. Legislation that came into force at this time would have made operations more difficult and expensive, and with the building of houses so close to the site at the former sewage works, the future of disposal would obviously have been a major concern for these residents. As it is, those residents appear to have been told little about the historic operations at the site or the potential health implications of living next to such a site. The site is classified as “A hazardous waste” area by the Environment Agency. This forms one of the main reasons for setting up this website.\\nRhodia has submitted a “closure plan” detailing the infrastructure they have in place for the management and monitoring of the site during their “aftercare phase” of the operations, and they have to provide procedures in place for reporting to the EA any “significant” environmental effects during the aftercare phase. “The aftercare phase” will last until Rhodia satisfies the EA that the site can no longer pose any threat of pollution of the wider environment and successfully apply for a certificate of Completion in order to surrender their licence. This is unlikely by their own admission to be in the near future, but the submission of potential housing plans for the whole area including the lagoon offer a strange dichotomy.

       " {'text': \"I have a new paper coming out in the journal Philosophy and Technology. It's about responsibility gaps and why, on some occasions, they are good thing and we shouldn't always try to plug them. More specifically, it has how one of the benefits of autonomous machines is that they enable a reduced cost form of moral delegation. More details below.\\nAbstract: There is a concern that the widespread deployment of autonomous machines will open up a number of 'responsibility gaps' throughout society. Various articulations of such techno-responsibility gaps have been proposed over the years, along with several potential solutions. Most of these solutions focus on 'plugging' or 'dissolving' the gaps. This paper offers an alternative perspective. It argues that techno-responsibility gaps are, sometimes, to be welcomed and that one of the advantages of autonomous machines is that they enable us to embrace certain kinds of responsibility gap. The argument is based on the idea that human morality is often tragic. We frequently confront situations in which competing moral considerations pull in different directions and it is impossible to perfectly balance these considerations. This heightens the burden of responsibility associated with our choices. We cope with the tragedy of moral choice in different ways. Sometimes we delude ourselves into thinking the choices we make were not tragic (illusionism); sometimes we delegate the tragic choice to others (delegation); sometimes we make the choice ourselves and bear the psychological consequences (responsibilisation). Each of these strategies has its benefits and costs. One potential advantage of autonomous machines is that they enable a reduced cost form of delegation. However, we only gain the advantage of this reduced cost if we accept that some techno-responsibility gaps are virtuous.\",\n",

The aim in such ostentation is to gain recognition in the estimation of people. It is termed Tawhid (). Minor Shirk- Riya!

       " {'text': \"Correction: A previous version of this story stated the bill attempts to criminalize sharing fake news. In fact, it's aimed at criminalizing the use of bots to spread political misinformation. We have updated the headline and a few sentences in the body as a consequence. Apologies for the missing nuance.\\nIf you use a social media bot to spread political misinformation in Ireland, go directly to jail, do not pass go and possibly pay €10,000.\\nThat’s the spirit of a bill Irish lawmakers proposed this week, which would make using a bot to create 25 or more online presences with the goal of influencing political debate a criminal offense. Actively promoting misinformation on Facebook or Twitter in that way would be punishable by five years in prison or fines of up to €10,000.\\nEoin O’Dell, an associate professor of law at Trinity College Dublin, told Poynter in an email that the whole of the bill takes a page from the Honests Ads legislation proposed in the United States Congress. That bill basically aims to make companies follow the same standards for political advertising that apply to broadcast television and radio.\\nHowever, by including a section that criminalizes the individual use of bots to spread political messages, Irish lawmakers have gone an extra mile.\\n“Section 6 goes much further than the U.S. bills, and reflects an unfortunate tendency amongst Irish backbenchers to reach for the criminal law when they don't like the internet,” O’Dell said.\\nThe move is an aggressive approach to a problem — and a concept — that has largely confounded Europe in recent months.\\nFollowing contentious elections and referenda in France, Italy and the United Kingdom that were marred by misinformation, the EU Commission has created a high-level group to figure out how to best address fake news online. But experts in the EU and elsewhere are doubtful that it will accomplish anything significant due to governance problems, and proposed solutions focus on issues like hate speech and advertising rather than misinformation.\\nCue this week’s bill, which is one of the most aggressive proposals to date in Europe. But does it have a genuine chance of passing or is it just grandstanding?\\nEugenia Siapera puts her money on the former.\\n“I’m not 100 percent sure, but I think it has a good chance of getting through,” said the deputy director of the Institute for Future Media and Journalism at Dublin City University. “We have some of the most draconian laws in terms of defamation.”\\nSince the Irish parliament has shown willingness to legislate against freedom of expression in the past, she said this new proposed law comes as no surprise. And, if passed, it could backfire.\\n“This will be perceived from the user as an infringement on their freedom of expression,” she said. “I agree with the implied intention of this legislation to maybe detoxify, maybe safeguard the public sphere from those who have malicious intent, but on the other hand we have to make sure citizens aren’t penalized for their right to freedom of expression.”\\nThere are other problems with the bill. Dan MacGuill, a writer for Snopes and former fact-checker for the Irish news website TheJournal.ie, told Poynter in an email that the bill is trying to solve a phantom issue.\\n“The first thing to know here is that — somewhat remarkably — there is no real ‘fake news’ to speak of in Ireland,” he said. “There was a general election in 2016, and an unusually intense one, at that, but we saw none of the deliberate, viral, monetized misinformation or foreign bots and imposter accounts that were a factor in the U.S. elections or Brexit referendum.”\\nThat doesn’t mean Ireland is immune to fake news. James Lawless, the bill’s author, told the Irish Independent that lawmakers need to start taking into account the possibility that the country could become a target for political misinformation in the future. And MacGuill said the upcoming referendum on abortion in Ireland — and the potentially divisive campaign surrounding it — could be a linchpin.\\n“I think there might be forces at work in Irish society that could mitigate against it,” he said. “But ultimately, the absence of fake news as a presence in the online landscape in Ireland might just be down to the fact that the Irish ‘market,’ as it were, has not yet been considered large or lucrative enough to be worth the effort of an organized campaign of monetized misinformation.”\\nStill, there’s the possibility that the bill is simply an attempt to score political points. Disagreeing with Siapera, O’Dell said it has little chance of being enacted in its current form due to the fact that it’s a private member's bill introduced by a member of the opposition. MacGuill also said that Lawless name-checked the Strategic Communications Unit, an initiative of Prime Minister Leo Varadkar that’s perceived as a “spin unit” of existing agencies, when promoting the bill, which strengthens the case that the bill has partisan motivations.\\nRegardless of intent, the proposal’s enforceability is questionable. Anya Schiffrin, director of the Technology, Media and Communications specialization at Columbia University’s School of International and Public Affairs, told Poynter in an email that she has doubts about Ireland’s ability to effectively legislate against bots and misinformation — especially beyond its own borders.\\n“That looks harsh,” said Schiffrin, who has reported on efforts to regulate fake news in Europe. “(I’m) wondering how they could punish people who are not Irish citizens or living in Ireland.”\\nIt’s a good question — one that lawmakers haven’t answered yet. But even if the final bill does include a plausible enforcement mechanism, Siapera said it’s very existence will harm the mainstream media by taking debate away from Ireland’s harsh defamation laws.\\n“Journalists are really reticent to pursue investigative reports because of the law. If now fake news is brought into the picture, it’s going to overcomplicate things, in my opinion,” she said. “We have to strike a balance here, but I’m not sure this specific legislation can accomplish that.”\",\n",

       " {'text': 'It is true that there are many aspects of our bodies that change as we grow older. For instance, the abundance of white hair and having sagging skin are usual markers that a person is growing old.\\nMany seem to think that losing teeth should also be accepted as a natural part of aging, but this should not be the case. With good and consistent dental care and hygiene, your teeth can stay intact even into old age.\\nIt is usually poor teeth management that leads to dental issues such as gum inflammation, chipping teeth, and tooth decay down the road. But while there is still time for you to take care of your teeth, do not delay adopting proper dental care practices to preserve your teeth.\\nBut first, what about when there are already signs of damage to your teeth?\\nDentures or Implants?\\nThere are instances in which irreversible damage has already occurred on your teeth. In these types of situations, one usually asks: should I get dentures or dental implants?\\nBoth dentures and implants accomplish the same purpose for those who use them. They allow you to chew your food easily and assist with speech since tooth loss affects your ability to do both easily. They also have cosmetic value, as it lets people gain back confidence lost from losing teeth. However, both differ significantly when it comes to price and maintenance.\\nGetting dental implants is a more expensive procedure than having dentures made, but implants are much easier to take care of. They require you to brush your teeth and floss properly as usual.\\nDentures, on the other hand, should not be worn overnight. You must keep them soaked in a denture solution or some water when not in use, as they can lose their shape if not stored accordingly. You also need to brush and clean your dentures before and after wearing them and require some adjustment in case your bite changes.\\nThe decision on getting dentures or implants ultimately depends on certain factors, such as one’s age, hygiene practices, and preference.\\nKeeping Teeth Healthy\\nThankfully, there are simple steps you can take to ensure the long-term health of your pearly whites. These three steps will take you far in taking care of your teeth.\\nMonitor your snacks and meals\\nWhat you eat has a significant effect on the health of your teeth, even when you are young. Firstly, consuming sugary foods creates an acid that breaks down the enamel of teeth, which leads to cavities. Sour, sticky candies are especially harmful as they do not only stick to teeth but also usually have more harmful acids than other sweets.\\nOne that many tend to overlook the effects of is ice. Although it is made of water, the usual instinct when drinking beverages with ice is to chew them. The stress this puts on your teeth can lead to breakage in the enamel, which can chip or crack teeth. Though the urge may be strong, avoid chewing on the ice in your drinks.\\nDo not smoke or stop smoking\\nSmoking also has a profound effect on your dental health. Smokers are more susceptible to gum disease because smoking gets in the way of the regular working of cells in your gum tissue. The activity also puts people at higher risk of oral cancer.\\nSmoking also lists bad breath and discoloration of teeth as its consequences, which can seem small, but hamper how one can participate in social interactions. Darkened teeth or a lack of them can make people lose confidence, which can make them unwilling to mingle with other people.\\nVisit your dentist regularly\\nDentist visits are not a suggestion. They are a must if you are to keep your teeth healthy until old age. Your dentist has the expertise to detect any potential issues before they further develop, which lets you get the treatment you need earlier. This means saving on expensive dental procedures and avoiding painful sensations on your teeth due to decay.\\nYou should also visit your dentist to get your teeth professionally cleaned. Professional cleaning is necessary because it removes plaque, especially in areas that are hard to reach with a toothbrush and floss. Most advice says that every six months is adequate, but this usually depends on your susceptibility to various dental conditions and issues.\\nKeeping your smile bright and healthy as you grow old does not have to be a complicated matter. Indeed, all it takes are regular dental checkups and discipline in keeping to your dentist-approved dental care routine.',\n",

       " {'text': 'ere is the list of top 5 questions to answer when an opportunity stalls for more than the average sales cycle.\\nFirst and foremost, as Salespeople, are we speaking to all the right people who matter in the account?\\n“Power resides where men believe it resides.\\nA sales opportunity stalls mainly due to the lack of “high and wide” coverage of the account. In any decent sized B2B opportunity in an enterprise, there would be many stakeholders (research says a minimum of 5) who are involved and concerned about the success of important projects.\\nSometimes, we don’t even know who they are. This happens due to a reason.\\nThere is a tendency for us to get stuck with the “evaluator” since he/she is the person who usually reaches out to us.\\nOur time in the account is dedicated to building a good rapport with the evaluator since he/she would gladly agree to meet or speak to us whenever we reach out.\\nHowever, it’s crucial to reach out to the “decision maker” since he has the larger business perspective of the project and more importantly the “veto” power.\\nThe way we campaign with the stakeholders, iterate on the solutions, get agreement and build alignment largely decides the pace at which we can drive the opportunity within the funnel.\\nIt’s important to embrace the chaos that unfolds while mapping the account. Also to anticipate and address all the risks.\\nThe biggest and the No.1 risk that we all run into is the “status-quo”.\\nWe need to work with the prospect in highlighting the upsides (e.g. revenue growth, cost reduction, higher compliance, etc) of taking the decision and moving ahead with the new solutions being proposed. Quantification of these factors can go a long way in providing the motivation of the customer to move out of “status-quo”.\\n“Chaos isn’t a pit. Chaos is a ladder.\\nThe other risk in the time factor.\\nDo we know if our proposal addresses one of the burning issues that the organization is trying to solve now? Or can it wait?\\nUsing the medical metaphor: Is our solution just a Vitamin tablet to be taken or an important flu shot to be administered OR a critical surgery to be performed that can’t be delayed?\\nWe need to ask questions and probe while meeting with the various stakeholders to understand the time sensitivity. The higher the order of priority, in the eyes of the customer, we can accelerate the buying process.\\nMany a time you would have noticed that the prospect doesn’t talk about other vendors in the fray or sometimes makes you believe that you are the ONLY vendor he is considering.\\nThat is indeed a good tactic from the customer’s side to motivate you to be highly engaged through the buying cycle, design the best solution and the right resources, get the best price offers and the most flexible commercial terms and conditions.\\nBut rarely does a prospect decide on a vendor or a solution without considering options.\\n“What we don’t know is what usually gets us killed.”\\nWhen we get blindsided on who the competition is, the opportunity tends to slow down. Mainly due to the reason of customer taking the laborious and time-consuming effort of figuring out whom to shortlist.\\nIf we know who our top 2 competitors are, then we can help position our compelling value and the unique differentiators to help the prospect decide faster.\\nObjections to your proposal are the main stepping-stones for getting closer to the final stage of closing the opportunity and getting the customer to say “yes”.\\nThe more proactive we are in surfacing the objections the faster we can be in accelerating the decision-making process of the prospect.\\nWhen a deal goes into a limbo one of the best situational tactics is to raise an objection or highlight a potential risk and showcase how your solution or your organization can overcome that risk. That act builds tremendous credibility and mostly gets the deal back on track.\\nDuring the sales process, “no-news” from the prospect is the “worst-news”.\\nRather than a lazy or an unimaginative “follow up” email, enquiring on the status of your proposal, surface objections to building attention and energy for sales closures.\\nIt would be valuable to understand the difference between exerting pressures on the customer vs. creating a sense of urgency.\\nWhy should the project be prioritized NOW than later?\\n“How do we create the urgency to act?”\\nSome of the benefits with which you can argue the case to accelerate the decision could be – the lead-time to market providing that crucial edge over the competition. Realizing the cost benefits to gain market share right away. Pulling the levers for driving revenue growth. Meeting the deadline for compliance and audit.\\nThe important aspect is to think on behalf of the customer and position these in a credible & an acceptable way.\\nThose are my top 5 questions and some potential ideas to think about.\\nWhat else could be the reasons for an opportunity to stall midway in the pipeline? What do you think? What are some of the measures that you have used effectively to accelerate opportunities in the pipeline? It would be very valuable to understand your perspectives and learn from your experiences.',\n",

       " {'text': 'How to Select a CNA College near Vilonia 72173\\nCongrats regarding your decision to practice as a CNA and enroll in certified nursing assistant training classes near Vilonia AR. Once you have achieved your certification, you will be starting a rewarding career in one of the most rapidly expanding positions in medical care within the Country. Though it may seem like a daunting endeavor, it’s important that you choose the best course to obtain the necessary training and education. Many prospective students begin with the two most essential qualifications, which are the location of the school and the cost of tuition. You might also be debating whether to attend CNA classes on campus, or enroll in an online CNA course and attend them from home. More about that option later. But completing your due diligence before picking a program involves far more than comparing the tuition or location. Such factors as accreditation and the reputation of the school must also be taken into account. We will be covering those issues together with several other questions that you should be asking before you register in a CNA school. But to begin with, let’s talk a little bit about what a nursing assistant does and the kind of training and credentials that are offered.\\nThe Job of a Nursing Assistant\\nCertified Nursing Assistants carry out many functions in the Vilonia AR hospitals, practices and other medical organizations where they work. As indicated by their title, CNAs are not licensed by the state but rather are certified. Because they are not licensed, they function under the direction and management of either a licensed LPN or RN. Plus as nursing assistants, their prime job duty is to aid the licensed nurses that they work under. Their responsibilities are many and diverse, and in a hospital environment can include:\\n- Furnishing basic services to patients\\n- Measuring patient’s vital signs\\n- Maintaining a record of patient’s health status\\n- Bathing and dressing patients\\n- Serving and assisting patients with meals\\n- Moving patients to other areas\\nCNAs might also work in Vilonia AR nursing homes or long term care facilities. In those settings, nursing assistants are more involved in aiding patients with their Activities of Daily Living (ADL). ADLs are defined as routine activities that most people accomplish daily without aid, such as eating, dressing, or using the bathroom. Nursing assistants usually develop more of a bond with these types of patients since they often stay in the facilities for extensive periods of time. Frequently, they can end up being the channel between the patient and the rest of the medical staff thanks to their familiarity with their charges. Because of this, the CNA’s expertise can be a significant resource for preparing the appropriate care and treatment of long term care patients.\\nIn contrast to other licensed nurses, certified nursing assistants do not need to earn a college degree. CNA education can be acquired at community colleges or at Vilonia AR vocational or trade schools. The length of the training program can take anywhere from one to three months, leading to either a certificate or a diploma. Under the 1987 Nursing Home Reform Act, students are mandated to have at least 75 hours of instruction, 16 of which need to be clinical or “hands-on” training hours. Bear in mind that this is the minimum period of instruction required and that each state has its own requirements. So it’s important to make sure that the program you enroll in not only satisfies the federal requirements, but additionally those for the state where you will be practicing. One recommendation is to contact the health or nursing board for your state to make certain that the education is state certified. Along with the training, each state mandates a passing score on a competency test for certification. Depending on the state, there might be other prerequisites as well.\\nOther Nursing Degree Options\\nThere are several degree options offered to become a nurse. And to become an RN, a student must attend an accredited school and program. A student can acquire a qualifying degree in just 2 years, or advance to attain a graduate degree for a total of six years. Following are some brief summaries of the nursing degrees that are available in the Vilonia AR area.\\n- Associates. The Associate Degree in Nursing (ADN) is normally a two year program made available by community colleges. It preps graduates for an entry level position in nursing in medical facilities such as hospitals, clinics or nursing homes. Many employ the ADN as an entry into nursing and later obtain a more advanced degree.\\n- Bachelor’s. The Bachelor of Science in Nursing (BSN) offers more comprehensive training than the ADN. It is commonly a four year program offered at colleges and universities. Licensed RNs may be eligible to complete an accelerated program based on their past training or degree and professional experience (RN to BSN). Those applying to the program may want to advance to a clinical or administrative position, or be more competitive in the employment market.\\n- Master’s. The Master of Science in Nursing (MSN) is usually a 2 year program after achieving the BSN. The MSN program provides specialization training, for example to become a nurse practitioner or concentrate on administration, management or teaching.\\nOnce a graduating student has acquired one of the above degrees, he or she must pass the National Council Licensure Examination for Registered Nurses (NCLEX-RN) so as to become licensed. Further requirements for licensing change from state to state, so be sure to contact the Arkansas board of nursing for any state mandates.\\nWhat to Ask CNA Training Classes\\nOnce you have decided on which nursing program to enroll in, as well as whether to attend your classes on campus or on the internet, you can use the following checklist to start narrowing down your options. As you no doubt are aware, there are many CNA schools and colleges within Arkansas and the United States. So it is essential to decrease the number of schools to choose from so that you will have a workable list. As we already pointed out, the site of the school along with the cost of tuition are most likely going to be the initial two things that you will take into consideration. But as we also stressed, they should not be your sole qualifiers. So before making your ultimate choice, use the following questions to see how your selection compares to the other schools.\\n- Accreditation. It’s a good idea to make sure that the certificate program along with the school is accredited by a U.S. Department of Education acknowledged accrediting agency. In addition to helping verify that you receive an excellent education and employment in the Vilonia AR area, it may help in acquiring financial aid or student loans, which are often not provided for non-accredited schools.\\n- Certification and Licensing Preparation. Certification and Licensing requirements for nurses vary from state to state. For CNA certification, passing a state specific exam is required. For RN and LPN licensing in all states, a passing score is required on the National Council Licensure Examination (NCLEX-PN or NCLEX-RN) as well as graduation from an accredited school. Many states require a specified number of clinical hours be completed, as well as the passing of additional tests. It’s essential that the school you are attending not only provides an exceptional education, but also prepares you to comply with the minimum certification or licensing requirements for Arkansas or the state where you will be practicing.\\n- Reputation. Look at internet rating companies to see what the reviews are for each of the schools you are looking into. Ask the accrediting agencies for their reviews as well. Also, contact the Arkansas school certification or licensing authority to determine if there are any complaints or compliance issues. Finally, you can speak with some Vilonia AR healthcare organizations you’re interested in working for after graduation and ask what their opinions are of the schools as well.\\n- Graduation and Job Placement Rates. Find out from the CNA programs you are looking at what their graduation rates are as well as how long on average it takes students to finish their programs. A low graduation rate may be an indication that students were unhappy with the program and dropped out. It’s also essential that the schools have high job placement rates. A high rate will not only substantiate that the school has a favorable reputation within the Vilonia AR medical community, but that it also has the network of contacts to help students obtain a position.\\n- Internship Programs. The most effective way to get experience as a certified nursing assistant is to work in a clinical setting. Essentially all nursing degree programs require a specified number of clinical hours be completed. A number of states have minimum clinical hour requirements for certification too. Find out if the schools have associations with local Vilonia AR hospitals, clinics or labs and help with the placement of students in internships.\\nOnline CNA Programs\\nAttending CNA programs online is emerging as a more in demand way to receive training and attain a certificate or diploma in Vilonia AR. Many schools will require attendance on campus for a component of the training, and almost all programs require a specified amount of clinical rotation hours performed in a local healthcare facility. But since the remainder of the training can be accessed online, this option may be a more practical solution to finding the free time to attend classes for some students. Pertaining to tuition, a number of online CNA programs are less expensive than other on campus choices. Even supplementary expenses such as for commuting and study materials can be reduced, helping to make education more economical. And numerous online programs are accredited by organizations such as the Commission on Collegiate Nursing Education (CCNE). And so if your job and family obligations have left you with little time to pursue your academic goals, it could be that an online CNA training program will make it more convenient to fit earning a certificate into your active schedule.\\nConsidering CNA Classes Near Vilonia Arkansas?\\nIf you have decided to enroll in a CNA Training Program in the Vilonia AR area, the following article may provide some interesting and useful information about the location of your new school campus.\\nVilonia is a city in Faulkner County, Arkansas, United States. Its population was 3,815 at the 2010 census, up from 2,106 at the 2000 census. It is part of the Little Rock–North Little Rock–Conway Metropolitan Statistical Area.\\nA small portion of the town was destroyed by a tornado on the evening of April 25, 2011. The devastated area was a mobile home park. The tornado was confirmed by National Weather Service survey crews, who rated the tornado a high end EF2. Four people were killed in the Vilonia area as a result of the twister.\\nOn April 27, 2014 in the late evening hours, a violent EF4 tornado slammed through Mayflower and continued on into Vilonia just before 8 PM. Sixteen people were killed, several homes in one subdivision were swept clean off their foundations, a 15-ton fertilizer tank was thrown 3/4 of a mile, and several businesses were damaged or destroyed. The rating is disputed due to the fact of houses being completely obliterated, but having cut nails as foundation anchors, which gave the tornado a final rating of EF4 with winds at 190 MPH. The NWS office in Little Rock said that if it occurred before the EF-Scale was implemented in 2007, it more than likely would have been rated an F5. There was consideration of upgrading the tornado to EF5 status, but due to the quality of construction, the EF4 rating stands.\\nEnroll in the Right CNA College near Vilonia AR\\nEnrolling in the right certified nursing assistant training program is potentially the most critical first step to starting a new career in the medical care industry. There are numerous variables that you need to take into account when deciding on a nursing school.

But it’s large for a reason.\\nThe drive’s housing comes with different layers of protection to keep the internal hard drive safe from shocks and drop — to a certain extent. It’s also designed to make it water-tight.\\nThe drive’s top and bottom are black, but its middle enclosure, called “all-around bumper” comes in Black, Blue, or Yellow. This part also has a groove that runs along the drive’s three sides to work as a cable holder.\\nAnd this is where things get interesting.\\nAwkward connection design\\nThe Armor A66 includes a USB cable that’s unlike most standard cables you’d find in other portable drives. It’s a USB-A to USB-A cable — the drive’s USB port is the same as one found in a computer. In other words, it’s somewhat of a non-standard cable.\\nAs a result, if you misplace yours, it’s hard to find a readily available replacement. And for this reason, it would be a much better design if the cable itself is permanently attached to the drive instead of being something you’d need to jank out of the groove and then attach to the port.\\nOn top of that, the drive will not work with a USB-C port without an adapter.\\nIn short, cable-wise, the Armor A66 is awkward — it’s so much worse than the design found in the Armor A75 that came out some four years ago. If you’re serious about using it, make sure you get a spare cable right away.\\nSilicon Power Armor A66: Hardware specifications\\n|Capacity||1TB, 2TB, 4TB, 5TB|\\n|Models||Black body with Black, Blue, or Yellow rim|\\n|Interface||USB 3.2 Gen 1 (5Gbps)\\nUSB-A female port\\n|Dimensions (LWH)||1TB/2TB: 5.48 x 3.78 x .63 in (13.9 x 9.6 x 1.6 cm)\\n4TB/5TB: 5.48 x 3.78 x .94 in (13.9 x 9.6 x 2.4 cm)\\n|Weight||1TB/2TB: .46 lb (209 g)\\n4TB/5TB: .72 lb (328 g)\\n|Bundled Software||SP Widget|\\n|Ruggedness||Military-grade MIL-STD 810G shockproof,\\nIPX4 water resistance protects\\n|Certification||CE, FCC, BSMI, Green dot, WEEE, RoHS, KC, RCM|\\nSilicon Power Armor A66: Detail photos\\nFrill-free drive, terrible software\\nOut of the box, the Armer A66 is formatted using the NTFS file system, so it’ll work right away with any Windows computer. You can easily reformat it for Mac if need be.\\nThe drive doesn’t come with any special features, such as hardware encryption, but it does come with the SP Widget software via download, which you’d wish it didn’t. Seriously, don’t use it!\\nI first had experience with SB Widget four years ago with the Armor A75 and thought it was terrible then. Well, the Armor A66 uses the same version.\\nThe software is so bad. The interface looks like something out of a high-schooler programming homework and functioned even worse in my testing. Again, don’t bother!\\nIn any case, you can always use Windows File History or Mac Time Machine to add more functions to the drive.\\nSilicon Power Armor A66: Fast hard drive-based performance\\nThe Silicon Power Armor A66 did well in my testing and was fast for a hard-drive-based portable drive.\\nVia a5Gbps USB 3.2 Gen 1 connection, it averages around 130MB/s in sustained copy speeds, the fastest among its peers, by a small margin.\\nThe drive worked with USB 2.0, too, and in this case, averaged around 39MB/s, which was about as fast as this standard can be.\\nThe drive remained cool and quiet even during extended tasks. It just worked.\\nIn terms of ruggedness, I tossed it around a few times on the carpet floor and left it in the kitchen sink for over five minutes (it sank!), and it survived intact.\\nFast hard-drive-based performance\\nUSB-A female port instead of USB-C\\nImpractical connection design\\nTerrible SP Widget software\\nThe Silicon Power Armor A66 would have been a terrific portable storage device had it come out five years ago. These days, though, you might question why it doesn’t use a solid-state drive on the inside instead.\\nNonetheless, if you’re looking for an affordable, high-capacity portable drive to carry on the go that can handle a bit of rough-housing, the Armor A66 is worth consideration. Alternatively, you can also check out the many SSD alternatives.\\n3rd Wave Of Technology Active Mind Technology Steve Suda Adia Technology Limited Anxiety Caused By Technology Aum Technology Job Openings Best Books On Licensing Technology Best Us Companies Drivetrain Technology Boulder Creek Ca Technology Companies Bounce Box Technology Bridgerland Applied Technology College Cafeteria Cisco Technology News Comcast Comcast Technology Internship Program Complete Automated Technology Defence Technology News Definition Information Technology System Digital Technology Digital Technology Pdf Director Dxc Technology Malaysia Sdn Bhd Emerging Technology In Healthcare 2019 Energy Efficient Home Technology Environmental Technology 2019 Esl Information Technology Vocabulary Farming Technology Replacing People I.T.

Shasta Conditions Report – March 16th, 2015\\nBy Shasta Mountain Guides\\nPlease visit the SMG website for more information: Shasta Mountain Guides\\nIt’s currently snowing on the mountain, we love rainy Mondays, and any other days for that matter! Despite the dry winter and unseasonably warm temps, Mt. Shasta has fared quite well this year and we’re grateful to have a fun and enjoyable winter at the top of the state! December and February delivered with significant storm totals to give us a solid base and thus far March has been kind with small systems to refresh and replenish our snowpack. The climbing and skiing have been fabulous!\\nThe long periods of high pressure have provided for unusually fun climbing and skiing with spring-like conditions. Although it may not be the winter dreams are made of; ski touring in t-shirts, flip flops in the parking lot, and low to no avalanche hazard has made for stress free touring and smiles for miles for backcountry enthusiasts.\\nLast week we received 4-6″ of new snow on Wednesday. This past weekend delivered more wet weather and although the snow levels are high, this is just what we need to provide a good climbing season on Mt. Shasta. The best news is the long term forecast which is showing a cold and wet trough bringing significant valley rain and mountain snow early next week with snow levels down to 5,000′. After 35+ years guiding on Mt. Shasta, we know one thing is certain, you can never predict what the weather will do, despite what the calendar says.\\nWe’ve been skiing some obscure lines as well as touring our old favorites. We have a full calendar of trips this year with something for everyone. Our upcoming Denali Prep Course 4/3-4/7 has just a couple spots left, as well as our new Cascade 2 for 1 for the hardiest mountaineers. Along with day classes and tours, summit climbs, ski descents, glacier seminars and spectacular ridge climbs for the alpinists out there, Mt. Shasta has been the place to be in 2015.\\nShasta Mountain Guides is your local professional guide service, on the mountain daily and in tune with the ever changing conditions. Call or email for questions or details. We look forward to seeing you on the mountain!',\n",

       " {'text': 'ERC Starting Grant for Martin Eckstein\\nJunior research group leader of the Hamburg-based MPSD receives a €1.5 million Starting Grant of the European Research Council for his research on ultrafast dynamics in complex materials\\nIn his research proposal “Theory of ultra-fast dynamics in correlated multi-band systems”, Martin Eckstein and his group plan to investigate how state-of-the-art laser spectroscopy can be used to manipulate solids on the extremely short timescale of femtoseconds. For comparison, one femtosecond is only one millionth of the processor clock time in a modern computer.\\nIn this context, complex material properties such as magnetism and superconductivity are of particular interest. These properties often emerge in so-called multi-band systems, in which the electrons can take several possible configurations at each atom. In his research, Martin Eckstein would like to obtain a theoretical understanding how these configurations evolve in time under the influence of strong laser light, and how this can bring about collective behavior, like in a swarm of birds, which are suddenly all flying in the same direction. With this understanding, one could develop concepts to generate entirely new states by the interaction of light and matter, or to switch between states with different properties in an extremely short time. Such experiments could, for example, also form the basis for new ultrafast communication technology.\\n“It is a great honor for me that the ERC has decided to support my research so generously,” says Martin Eckstein. “The MPSD in Hamburg is an internationally renowned institution in the very active field of ultrafast dynamics. It has already been an ideal environment for the work leading to the ERC proposal, and I am looking forward to exciting research in the coming five years.”\\nMartin Eckstein studied physics at the University of Augsburg, which also awarded him a doctorate in theoretical solid state physics in 2009. Subsequently, he spent a two-year postdoctoral research stay at the ETH Zürich. Since October 2011 he leads a junior research group at the Max Planck Institute for the Structure and Dynamics of Matter and is professor at the University of Hamburg.\\nERC Starting Grants are awarded annually. They are designed to encourage young talented research leaders to gain independence in Europe and to build their own careers. The program supports research projects conducted at public or private research organizations in one of the EU Member States or Associated Countries with funding of up to € 1.5 million over a period of up to 5 years. The sole evaluation criterion is the scientific excellence of the researcher and the research proposal.',\n",

       " {'text': 'The Tuatha\\'an, (pronounced: too-AH-thah-AHN), are a nomadic people who live in brightly painted wagons and live by a pacifist philosophy known as the Way of the Leaf. Outsiders sometimes call them \"Tinkers\" or refer to them as the \"Traveling People\".\\nThe Tuatha\\'an were originally Da\\'shain Aiel who followed the Way of the Leaf. After the Aiel were repeatedly attacked by bandits, Sulwin and several others of the Aiel defied Adan, then leader of the Jenn Aiel. They abandoned the items of the One Power entrusted to them by the Aes Sedai and took their wagons in search of the \"song\" (may refer to the prologue of \"The Eye of the World\", in which the mad Lews Therin asks Ishamael if he has \"the Voice\" so as to participate in \"the Singing\"). This group became the Tuatha\\'an.\\nThe Tuatha\\'an are one of the few peoples allowed passage through the Aiel Waste, perhaps because the Aiel cannot bring themselves to interact with such a strange people, although it seems more likely that the Wise Ones and clan chiefs know of their mutual origins and refuse to allow the Aiel near the Tuatha\\'an.\\nThe Tuatha\\'an continued to search in vain for their song, because the song they were looking for did not exist.\\nThe Way of the Leaf defines how the Tuatha\\'an interact with outsiders. Tuatha\\'an will never do any violence, be it in anger or self-defense, not even to save their own life or that of another. If they feel that violence or physical confrontation may ensue, they will simply hide or leave the area.\\nThis pacifism extends to other creatures. They are vegetarians and only consume fruits, nuts, berries and vegetables. It is not known whether they are vegan or not, but we do not observe them eating eggs or dairy and they appear to not rear any farm animals.\\nThey also do not stay near areas where population is concentrated, as there is a greater propensity for violence in larger settlements. Their beliefs and actions frequently earn them repudiation by common folk. They are considered habitual thieves and, though they do not actively recruit new members, are often accused of trying to convert children to the Way of the Leaf.\\nTinker Aes Sedai are also very rare as very few Tinker children wish to channel, as then they must become Aes Sedai and break from the Way of the Leaf.\\nDespite the fact that Aiel look today exactly as they looked in the AoL, wearing cadin\\'sor, having light skin color and the majority of them having hair in shades of red, from dark-red to golden-reddish-blond, even their haircut is exactly what they wear thousands of years ago, Tuatha\\'an people does not look much like Aiel at all. Which is unsurprising given that they\\'ve had many converts join them over the generations and thus have interbred with other peoples.\\nReferences from Rand\\'s visions in Rhuidean\\nAiel followed the Way of the Leaf and only the Tuaha\\'an stayed loyal to that.\\nSolinda sedai tells to Jonai:\\nTuatha\\'an people never stay long in one place. They keep moving although their reason for that is changed during the time.\\nThe search for their lost song was the primary goal of the Tuatha\\'an by the time of the events in the series. It has been theorized that the song might have been known to Lews Therin Telamon and thereby to Rand Al\\'Thor, and it has likewise been suggested that the Aiel could have learned the song through the use of the pillars ter\\'angreal at Rhuidean. While this could potentially be true, co-author Brandon Sanderson responded on his personal Facebook page to the question of whether the Tuatha\\'an ever discovered their lost song. He responded, \"[Robert Jordan] said specifically this was something that did not happen, at least not in the scope of the novels.\" (February 4th, 2013)\\nBrandon Sanderson reveals in an interview in January, 2013:\\nRand doesn’t know the Song and the Tinkers wouldn’t accept anything he taught them anyhow.\\nRobert Jordan specifically noted that the Tinkers would not find their Song by the end of the series and that the Ogier song of growing is not the Tinkers’ Song. The Song is \"a much more deep and philosophical concept, perhaps unattainable.\"\\nFrom Loial\\'s memory:\\nThe name Tuatha\\'an comes from the Tuatha De Danann in Irish legend, who were a race of people who settled in Ireland. This reflects their wandering status in the Wheel of Time. The name of the only known Tuatha\\'an Aes Sedai, Aisling Noon, strongly resembles the Old Irish Aislinge Óenguso, the Dream of Angus, one of many myths in a series known as the Mythological Cycle.\\nTheir culture and reputation is also strongly reminiscent of what, in Ireland, are also referred to as Tinkers. This, like in the books, is a slang term used for Irish Travellers. The name Tuatha\\'an translates from the Old Tongue as the Travelling People.\\nThe Song seems to be a part of Tuatha\\'an religion originating in the Songs of Growing (the songs used in Treesinging) which the Tuatha\\'an\\'s progenitors the Da\\'shain Aiel once sang with the Ogier and Nym in the Age of Legends. However while Rand\\'s trip through Rhuidean shows the Song\\'s clear origin in the Songs of Growing, RJ and Brandon have confirmed the Tuatha\\'an would never accept the Songs of Growing as the Song, as the Song is something far more based in ideals, spirituality, and religion having evolved over the previous 3,000 plus years through retellings of stories and legends. Indeed in The Eye of the World Loial even mentions teaching the Songs of Growing to the Tuatha\\'an before he ever met Rand and the Tuatha\\'an had already decided the Songs of Growing were not the Song.\\nThe Tuatha\\'an are very similar to the real life Roma in both persecution with a reputation for being thieves and in that they live in wagons.',\n",

       " {'text': \"The high-low method of determining the fixed and variable portions of a mixed cost relies on only two sets of data: 1) the costs at the highest level of activity, and 2) the costs at the lowest level of activity. If either set of data is flawed, the calculation can result in an unreasonable, negative amount of fixed cost.\\nTo illustrate the problem, let's assume that the total cost is $1,200 when there are 100 units of product manufactured, and $6,000 when there are 400 units of product are manufactured. The high-low method computes the variable cost rate by dividing the change in the total costs by the change in the number of units of manufactured. In other words, the $4,800 change in total costs is divided by the change in units of 300 to yield the variable cost rate of $16 per unit of product. Since the fixed costs are the total costs minus the variable costs, the fixed costs will be calculated to a negative $400. This unacceptable answer results from total costs of $1,200 at the low point minus the variable costs of $1,600 (100 units times $16), or total costs of $6,000 at the high point minus the variable costs of $6,400 (400 units times $16).\\nThe negative amount of fixed costs is not realistic and leads me to believe that either the total costs at either the high point or at the low point are not representative. This brings to light the importance of plotting or graphing all of the points of activity and their related costs before using the high-low method. (The number of units uses the scale on the x-axis and the related total cost at each level of activity uses the scale on the y-axis.) It is possible that at the highest point of activity the costs were out of line from the normal relationship—referred to as an outlier. You may decide to use the second highest level of activity, if the related costs are more representative.\\nIf the $6,000 of cost at the 400 units of activity is an outlier, you might select the next highest activity of 380 units having total costs of $4,000. Now the variable rate will be the change in total costs of $2,800 ($4,000 minus $1,200) divided by the change in the units manufactured of 280 (380 minus 100) for a variable rate of $10 per unit of product. Using the variable rate of $10 per unit manufactured will result in the fixed costs being a positive $200. The positive $200 of fixed costs is calculated at either 1) the low activity: total costs of $1,200 minus the variable costs of $1,000 (100 units at $10); or at 2) the high activity: total costs of $4,000 minus the variable costs of $3,800 (380 units at $10).\",\n",

       " {'text': 'Empowered Women Fight Poverty\\nIt\\'s nearly 100 years since the UK government passed the Representation of the People Act 1918 and over 150 years since women\\'s suffrage started. The 8th March is International Women\\'s Day, yet in 2014 the World Economic Forum predicted that it would take until 2095 to achieve global gender equality. While the last hundred years have seen considerable progress, women across the world should not have to wait until the end of this century to achieve gender equality.\\nThis is an issue that cuts across rich and poor countries and is a Pandora\\'s Box of injustice. There are just 22 female CEOs in the Fortune 500 and less than 10 per cent of executive directors of FTSE 100 companies are women. According to the Global Poverty Project, \"women make up half the world\\'s population and yet represent a staggering 70 per cent of the world\\'s poor. We live in a world in which women living in poverty face gross inequalities and injustice from birth to death. From poor education to poor nutrition to vulnerable and low pay employment, the sequence of discrimination that a woman may suffer during her entire life is unacceptable but all too common\".\\nOne thing is clear to me, and drawing on my experience as a Commissioner for Racial Equality for the UK government and as a core adviser on improving inclusion within London\\'s Metropolitan Police, equality doesn\\'t just happen because of good will or fine intentions. It takes a combination of principle, rational and emotional belief in equality, and a relentless commitment to seek practical steps to improve inclusivity.\\nThe Economics of Gender Equality\\nWomen produce half of the world\\'s food and work 70 per cent of the world\\'s working hours, yet earn only 10 per cent of the world\\'s income and own less than 1 per cent of the world\\'s property.\\nGender equality is more than a matter of social justice. When women have equal access to education, and go on to participate fully in business and economic decision-making, they become a catalyst to fight poverty. Their increased earnings improve household incomes and the well-being of children which subsequently helps reduce poverty for future generations.\\nAccording to the OECD, when more women work, economies grow. If a truly global movement to ensure women\\'s empowerment and equality is the panacea to ending poverty, what are some of the roadblocks?\\nThere are significant legal and legislative changes needed to ensure women\\'s rights are upheld and cherished around the world. While a record 143 countries guaranteed equality between men and women in their Constitutions, another 52 don\\'t. In fact, in many nations gender discrimination is still evident in legal structures and social norms.\\nGoal 5 of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) - to achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls - is a key enabler to overcome this historical injustice. In order to meet the Goal, significant actions will be required and laws changed. For example, there are still 26 countries that differentiate between men and women through statutory inheritance laws. This exposes women to greater vulnerability to poverty and food insecurity, and limited or no access to resources and credit, making them increasingly dependent upon men to secure a livelihood.\\nFurthermore, gender differences in laws affect both developing and developed economies. Almost 90 per cent of 143 economies studied by the OECD have at least one legal difference restricting women\\'s economic opportunities. Of those, 79 economies have laws that restrict the types of jobs that women can do, and husbands can prevent their wives from working in 15 economies.\\nClimbing the education mountain\\nStructural changes allowing women access to business, property, inheritance and safe jobs are vital, as well as ensuring universal access to sexual and reproductive health. Another crucial solution is education. Furthering women\\'s and girls\\' education contributes to higher economic growth. Increased educational outputs account for about 50 per cent of the economic growth in OECD countries over the past 50 years. Of this, over half is a result of girls having had access to higher levels of education and achieving greater equality in the number of years spent in school.\\nSince 2000, the UN with the rest of the global community, have made gender equality in primary education a central tenant to ensure women are able to contribute fully to their communities both economically and socially. More girls are now in school compared to 15 years ago, and most regions have reached gender equality in primary education. The impact? Women now account for 41 per cent of paid workers outside of the agricultural sector, compared to 35 per cent in 1990.\\nThis is a great achievement, but there is still a mountain to climb. According to the UN, 9.5 million girls will never set foot in a classroom compared to 5 million boys. If this trend continues, by 2020, we can expect almost 16 million girls aged 6 to 11 to be denied the chance to learn to read and write.\\nSince 2009, KPMG has supported the Millennium Village Project (MVP) in Pemba, Tanzania. The MVP is designed to help sub-Saharan rural communities end extreme poverty by working towards improving health, ensuring gender equality and fighting diseases. Since 2009 we have invested over $2m in health, education and infrastructure. Most critically, however, we have empowered women and girls with improved educational and livelihood opportunities.\\nWe have to be driven by our values, and our actions must be determined by our principles. I am committed to empowering women with improved education and livelihood opportunities not only to uphold their rights, but because it also makes economic sense.',\n",

       " {'text': 'I have now read five books by Bart D. Ehrman about Jesus and The New Testament. This is rather strange considering I’m an atheist. The books were\\n- Misquoting Jesus: The Story Behind Who Changed the Bible and Why (2005)\\n- Jesus, Interrupted: Revealing the Hidden Contradictions in the Bible (And Why We Don’t Know About Them) (2009)\\n- Forged: Writing in the Name of God—Why the Bible’s Authors Are Not Who We Think They Are (2011)\\n- Did Jesus Exist?: The Historical Argument for Jesus of Nazareth (2012)\\n- How Jesus Became God: The Exaltation of a Jewish Preacher from Galilee (2014)\\nThe reason why I’m so fond of Ehrman’s books is he’s a historian writing about how Christianity came about and does not digress into theology. I study the origins of Christianity in the same way my friend Mike studies ancient Greek literature and philosophy. Ehrman works very hard to walk the razor’s edge seeking the academic truth of things, but in doing so, often offends the faithful.\\nMost people in America who consider themselves Christians aren’t interested in the historical details of their faith—they believe because that is what they were taught growing up and never took the time to study The New Testament. If they did, they’d find it to be a black hole of endless scholarship. Ehrman is the James A. Gray Distinguished Professor of Religious Studies at the University of North Carolina and he says his classes are very popular with all kinds of people, and points out that his conclusions of historical scholarship are middle of the road, and most of what he teaches has been common knowledge for a long time in seminary schools. Readers are often shocked by what they read in Ehrman’s books but that’s because the ideas are new to the readers, and not to historians of Biblical scholarship.\\nIf what you know about Christianity and The New Testament is was what you learned in Sunday School you might find Ehrman’s books both fascinating and a challenge to your beliefs. Ehrman started out as a Evangelical himself, but after years of Bible study has become an agnostic. His books do not attack beliefs or believers. Ehrman is the kind of truth seeker that learned the ancient languages of The Bible so he could do his own translating, and got a doctorate from Princeton Theological Seminary. Ehrman moved from believing in The Bible to becoming obsessed with how The New Testament came about. He has written over twenty-five books on the subject, some for the general reader and others for academic scholars.\\nWe know very little about the actual man Jesus, but through the detective work of textual analysis, anthropology and historical studies of the times in which Jesus lived, Ehrman pieces out one view of Jesus that he claims is a pretty common view among Bible historians. This is best seen in Did Jesus Exist? Then Ehrman explains how the followers of Jesus made him into the God we know today in the book How Jesus Became God. Then his books Misquoting Jesus, Jesus, Interrupted and Forged explores how The New Testament and Christianity evolved in the first four hundred years after Jesus’ death. If you read these five books you’ll have a pretty good overview of the current historical studies on Jesus and The New Testament. Ehrman also has a number of entertaining courses at The Great Courses site.\\nI read these five books in the order they were written and published, but I’d recommend reading them in a different order if you are new to Ehrman. They all cover the same big territory, but they each focus on threads of finer detail.\\nDid Jesus Exist?\\nI’d start with Did Jesus Exist? because Jesus is how everything got started in the first place. Ehrman finds the most objection to his books by fundamentalists who believe in the literal truth of The Bible, and strangely for this book, by atheists and agnostics who wish to disprove the existence of Jesus. There is a growing population of humanists who wish to turn Jesus into a myth, and Ehrman’s historical work undermines their beliefs too. Basically, Ehrman walks a middle ground between the fervor of belief and disbelief.\\nI wish the conclusion to this book was available online so I could link to it. Ehrman explains how he attended a meeting of the American Humanists Association to receive their Religious Liberty Award and was surprised to find the non-believers spending so much time talking about religion. He was also shocked that many of these scientific minded people have thoroughly embraced books by writers who claim Jesus is a myth. It disturbs Ehrman because he knows the pseudo-scholarship approach to proving Jesus is a myth has as much academic validity as Creationism and Intelligent Design and these proclaimed embracers of science don’t seem to know that.\\nEhrman in his book Did Jesus Exist? has to attack ideas many of his most popular fans cherish. Ehrman’s books clearly disproves the fundamentalist view of the literal interpretation of The Bible, which agnostics and atheists love, but his scholarship also finds consistent evidence that a man named Jesus did exist. So, in one book Ehrman undermines the faithful and the unbelievers. Ehrman shows the same kind of airy philosophy that goes into convincing people that Jesus was a God is the very same kind of philosophical slight-of-hand that goes into making Jesus a myth.\\nWhether you’re a believer or disbeliever, don’t you want to know the truth? I’m not saying the Ehrman knows the absolute truth, but I am saying his middle of the road, conservative academic approach is more scientific and reliable than just taking other people’s word for things. What we all need to do is learn to demand the evidence for anything claiming to be true. And we need to learn the difference between bullshit evidence and research consensus evidence.\\nEhrman embraces the study of history as if it was a science, demanding evidence. The mythicists, as Ehrman calls the Jesus as myth people, promote their beliefs without real academic vigor. Some only offer wild speculation, but others, some even with PhDs, do attempt to make their points with evidence, but Ehrman makes a good case their evidence is poor, and their logic weak. It’s a fascinating book that sets the stage for his next book.\\nHow Jesus Became God\\nEhrman works to prove that Jesus did not see himself as God, or even divine, but that his followers after his death did deify him. Ehrman carefully and academically explains the historical existence of Jesus and how Christians transformed a flesh and blood man into divine being to serve their purposes. This is a great book for The New Testament Bible study because Ehrman spends most of his time exploring the writings of Paul, the four Gospels, Acts and other references in The New Testament to show how Jesus changed over time. The textual analysis Ehrman makes should be obvious to anyone who just reads The Bible. So, why haven’t most Christians noticed what Ehrman points out?\\nMost people who read The Bible, read it in pieces, jumping around as it’s presented in a Sunday School lesson or sermon each Sunday. Ehrman suggests reading it by comparing all the stories from different books about the same event. This any reader can do. What Ehrman brings to the table that most average Bible readers don’t have is the scholarship that explains when various parts of The Bible was written and by who. When you plot what was said when, you’ll begin to notice that The New Testament is full of contradictions but they make sense if you look at them on a timeline. It’s quite obvious that theology developed over time, and the theology was constantly changing. Even within The New Testament its possible to see that Jesus went from a man to a God. However, to fully understand this transformation requires further study of Christian theologians and their writing for the next three hundred years. How Jesus went from human being to The Trinity took three hundred years to hammer out, and there were a lot of strange side trips along the way, especially by Christians now called heretics and Gnostics today.\\nHow Jesus Became God sets things up nicely for the first Ehrman book I read.\\nHave you ever wondered how The New Testament was written, edited and published? Especially since it was put together over a thousand years before the printing press. Have you ever wondered who wrote The New Testament? Many people think it’s the absolute word of God, as if God dictated The Bible to someone. Have you never noticed that Bible stories have many different points of view, writing styles and often contradict each other? Have you never wondered how something that was written almost two thousand years ago could be published consistently without errors and changes? Have you ever tried to copy a passage in a book by handwriting? How well did you do?\\nOnce you learn that who Jesus was is determined by who was writing about him, then it’s easy to understand how The New Testament was put together and why. Actually, The New Testament is very poorly edited because its far from consistent. It leaves in evidence of earlier thinking that was supplanted by later theology. And it becomes all too obvious that your favorite Jesus quote depends on when that portion of The New Testament was written, and what his orthodox followers believed at that time.\\nAnd as manuscripts were passed around the Roman world, copied by scribes in different locals, with different beliefs, often they were altered to reflect a particular view of Jesus. We don’t have the original drafts of The New Testament books, but we do have hundreds and hundreds of copies that showed up hundreds of years later. We can trace changes that were made as they circulated from community to community. And scholars have also detected forgeries.\\nHave you ever heard that some of the books in The New Testament were forgeries? For example, for over a hundred years now, some scholars believe some of the books claimed to be written by Paul were obviously not. How did they learn that? Plagiarism and forgery did not exist like it does today, so Bart D. Ehrman has to explain how the various books were written and how their authorship got attributed. Back in the early days of Christianity, in the first four hundred years after Jesus died, being a famous author was not like it is today. If you wrote something you wanted people to believe, you often said it was written by someone else, someone people would believe.\\nUsing contextual study, and even computers to analyze style and content, it’s possible to determine if the same person wrote or did not write two different essays. But even without the skills of a historian or a computer, it’s pretty easy to see that certain lessons from different books in The New Testament teach radically opposing ideas. Reading Forged will show the common Bible study student how to read scripture far more closely. This leads us to the last book I’m recommending to read.\\nKnowing what Jesus really said is very difficult. Most religious people assume everything printed in red in The New Testament is something Jesus actual said. Well, historians like Ehrman would beg to disagree. What’s so fascinating about this book is Ehrman gets to write a bestselling book pointing out contradictions in The New Testament that any careful reader should have already noticed for themselves. I have a feeling that most believers attending church were like me as a kid. I listened to the preacher quote a passage of The Bible and then tie in some personal experiences from his own life or people in the church, and then turn scripture and contemporary life problems into a sermon. As a kid I never read The Bible from start to finish. If we did, we might remember while reading The Gospel of John things said that might contradiction what we head already read in The Gospel of Mark. Most readers don’t cross-compare, but just work to decipher scriptures one line at a time.\\nEhrman teaches readers the trick of parallel reading. Pick specific incidents in the life of Jesus, and then read about the same incident in different places throughout The New Testament. It becomes all to obvious that the various writers had different stories to tell, and different theology to preach. The contrast between the stories in Mark and John are startling. Why haven’t the average Bible reader notice that? I’m sure many have, but I think most haven’t.\\nIf you go searching for reviews of these books at Google you can find lots of reviewers who attack what Ehrman has to say. Now there are different kinds of attacks. Sometimes, other scholars call Ehrman out on his scholarship. It seems to me that in Ehrman’s newer books he spends far more writing time explaining how he made his conclusions in comparison to other scholars, in a preemptive attack on this kind of criticism. This makes for good writing and better reading. The other common kind of attack on Ehrman’s work is by Christian apologists who seek to defend their specific theological view. The quality and validity of these kinds of criticism vary greatly.\\nEhrman constantly reminds his reader that he is a historian and that metaphysics lies outside the scope of historical studies. The trouble is the true believer, especially the fundamentalist, believe that their theology is the true view of history. They assume the metaphysical is part of history. This is what makes Ehrman’s books controversial with certain readers.\\nI am an atheist. I don’t believe the metaphysical exists. To me, Ehrman’s books are excellent explanations on how Christianity got started in a historical context. His books also explain to me at least, when and how some Christians acquired their theological and metaphysical ideas. True believers don’t seem to understand that all concepts, all memes, have a history. Someone thought them up. Where we differ is I see them as ideas and they see them as God’s word.\\nThese five books by Bart D. Ehrman go a long way to explaining the history of certain ideas that are programmed deeply into Western culture. No historian, philosopher or scientist will ever be able to prove or disprove the cherished metaphysical desires of believers. However, most believers embrace their beliefs without much analysis. Reading these five books could dissolve such beliefs because they raise logical questions that are corrosive to simple thinking. However, there are many believers who develop very complex thought systems to maintain their beliefs. These people will have to read Ehrman and come up with rationalizations that counter his assertions.\\nJWH – 7/21/14',\n",

Young people starting families and recent college graduates seeking careers in education were straying away from the city for that reason. To combat this issue, Teacher’s Village was born. Teacher’s Village is a living and learning community centered in the heart of Newark. The community is mapped out across a mixed-use lot which takes up five blocks downtown in the city. Hoping to attract educators and families to the area, Teacher’s Village maintains 204 residential units and 65,000 square feet of retail space. The lot seeks to breathe new meaning into the one stop shop concept. Centered around an education focus, the Village has three charter schools and a daycare, all within an incredibly short commute from the homes of Teacher’s Village residents. This allows for a more productive timeline as educators are able to spend more time maintaining after-school activities and programs for the students.\\nAllen Chi is a proud supporter of Teacher’s Village’s innovative approach to tackling the increased cost of living issue.

It was on the first day in Orgosolo, when for a photo, Enza threw herself upon the rim of a large stone fireplace and decided to show the pudge on her waist to make good the claim that she needed to banish it — that I knew we had found gold. Her candour was refreshing. Her cousin Giampi was equally enthusiastic when it came to posing for photos, so we ended up with enough shots of us too. We needed us in our albums, they said.\\nThe Gallura lives up to the meaning of its name which means stony area. Granite hills tower over you upon roads that twist and turn before find their way to a jagged coastline made up of islets and rock cliffs. Rocks which emerge in shapes that make you think of elephants, bears, witches and mushrooms, rocks which are shaped by the fury of the Mistral that blows throughout the year in Sardinia, but is an exhibitionist during spring and winter. We had caught the best of it.\\nWith the wind in our hair on a miserably cold, foggy morning we set out for the hills. They were shrouded in a blanket of white that day, imparting the landscape with an other-worldly atmosphere. We stopped for croissant and coffee at an artists’ village surrounded by monolithic granite hills (which looked more like gigantic boulders) and emerald green woods.\\nSan Pantaleo is a fetching village built around a piazzetta, surrounded by a church and a few oleander trees. It started life in the late 1800s. By the 1960s, artists had started making inroads into it, living in traditional low stone cottages lovingly restored. They set up galleries and they worked with folk traditions that centered around ceramics, woodwork and wrought iron. It is the kind of place where you expect locals to sell homemade batches of honey, cheese and jams and indulge in lengthy conversations because there lifestyle is laidback and elegant. Even though it is not too far away from the flashy haunt of the rich and famous, the Costa Smeralda.\\nNear this village is a nuragic archaeological site. Since I have been banging on about the presence of mysterious nuraghi around the island, I thought I should put in a few words about the Tomba dei Giganti (Tomb of the Giants). If you want to dip your feet into mystery and antiquity, it is an interesting visit. It made me reflect upon the very impermanence of everything, how we humans never stop to think about it in our arrogant assumption that things should not decay or change, that they should not make way for another civilisation.\\nLater, we did a short hike above the camping village of Capo d’Orso, climbing slimy rocks and gaping at the way the wind had carved and chiselled granite, like a master sculptor if you will, and the way the granite rocks punctured the incredibly green landscape, while jagged rocks spread their talons along the coastline. It was a peaceful moment that, rendered romantic by Enza pressing kisses upon her partner’s face and murmuring words of endearment into his ears. I can still hear them, those two words of affection, amore mio, uttered over and over with the wonderful cadence of an Italian.\\nIt goes with the mood of today. It is the birthday of a being who once lit up my life with love and happiness, Tuktuk.',\n",

       " {'text': 'Stardew Valley is something of a wonder. It was developed over several years by a single person using a nickname ConcernedApe and it gained a devoted following nearly overnight.\\nContrary to games such as the Farming Simulator series, Stardew Valley is happy to abstract some of the more tedious aspects of running a farm in favor of energy/time management and using the space in the most efficient way. It also has a charming art style and offers plenty of activities besides just tending your farm.\\nHowever, one can play a single game for only so long, no matter how good it is. We have prepared a small list of games which may tick some of the boxes that Stardew Valley does.\\n|Moonlighter||2018-05-29||Adventure||Digital Sun||82%||See more|\\n|Sun Haven||2021-06-25||Indie||Pixel Sprout Studios||See more|\\n|Hokko Life||2021-06-02||Adventure||Wonderscope||22%||See more|\\n|Garden Story||2021-08-11||Adventure||Picogram||See more|\\n|World’s Dawn||2016-01-25||Indie||Wayward Prophet||See more|\\n|Story of Seasons: Friends of Mineral Town||2020-07-14||Simulation||Marvelous Inc.||5%||See more|\\n|Farm Together||2018-02-22||Indie||Milkstone Studios||43%||See more|\\n|Slime Rancher||2017-08-01||Adventure||Monomi Park||61%||See more|\\n|Graveyard Keeper||2018-08-15||Adventure||Lazy Bear Games||74%||See more|\\n|My Time At Portia||2018-01-23||Indie||Pathea Games||82%||See more|\\n|Kynseed||2018-11-08||Indie||PixelCount Studios||See more|\\nMoonlighter’s obvious similarity to Stardew Valley is the pixelated aesthetic, but there are more things to consider. Moonlighter is a game about being a shopkeeper in a fantasy world, stocking various hard-to-get resources and, potentially, magical artifacts looted from nearby dungeons. Your parents were merchants and you inherited their store, but your true calling is to be a Hero.\\nWhile you aren’t cultivating a farmland, there are some elements, Moonlighter can still hit the same vibe as SDV. A good half of the playtime you spend doing relaxingly mundane stuff, like putting your wares on display and handling customers. You also interact with the citizens of a nearby town, restoring their businesses with money you earn thanks to your hobby of delving dungeons for sweet loot.\\n|Developer||Pixel Sprout Studios|\\nSun Haven is an answer to the question: what if Stardew Valley had more fantasy RPG elements. The result is a game that, in addition to enjoyable, relaxing farming also features several playable species, monsters to defeat, and a robust skill tree giving you access to both mundane and magical methods of defending yourself. There’s also home decoration, crafting, several towns…plenty to do indeed.\\nSun Haven also comes with multiplayer for up to 8 people, because, as Stardew Valley proved, cooperative farming can be quite a bonding experience. To complete the picture, you can also romance a whole bunch of NPCs and marry them to have them join you in your humble (or not so humble) cottage. At the time of writing Sun Haven is in Early Access, but already shows great promise.\\nAdmittedly Hokko life bears more resemblance to the Nintendo Switch hit Animal Crossing: New Horizons, but that only means that, by transitive property, it also has a lot in common with Stardew Valley. This game drops in a small town with lots on uninhabited space, and lets you go hog wild on customizing your property via a very robust and flexible design tool in your workshop.\\nTrue to theme, there’s also plenty of farming to do, with a bunch of different crops and fruits you’ll be able to sell for NPCs. There are even tunnels you can venture into to mine minerals for your uncontrollable crafting endeavors. Like Sun Haven above, Hokko Life is has recently (at the time of writing) entered in Early Access, and it might just be a good PC substitute for Animal Crossing.\\nGarden Story is charming game with big ideas. You’re playing as an enthusiastic and resourceful little berry whose task is to restore the village to glory. This quest involves a non-insignificant amount of fighting against the invasive, mysterious Rot, and a fair share of crafting, farming, and construction. There are several NPCs still in the village, and you’ll do them many favors throughout the game.\\nGarden Story has a lovely aesthetic, full of clean lines and pastel colors which work really well with the game’s relaxing atmosphere. Even the Rot looks almost friendly, and it’s your enemy! If you’re not particularly keen on combat, the game has no problem letting you minimize the risks in its options. If you’re looking for a relaxing, pleasant game with constructive gameplay, check Garden Story out.\\nWorld’s Dawn and Stardew Valley are very similar, but it’s not because one is a clone of the other. Both games take inspiration from an older title, Harvest Moon, and similarities they share are the result of this heritage. There’s everything: farming to your heart’s content, relationships (including marriage) with NPC living in a quiet, sleepy town you find yourself in, and various thematic minigames.\\nThere’s also, of course, time management (including passing seasons) which is so crucial for a farming and community simulator. World’s Dawn looks very retro, including an unusual resolution and graphics, but that simply adds to the nostalgic, relaxing atmosphere of the game. If you want something JUST like Stardew Valley, World’s Dawn is as close as it gets.\\nStory of Seasons: Friends of Mineral Town\\nIncluding this one is a bit like cheating, because the series we now know as Story of Season used to be known as… Harvest Moon, the very series that inspired Stardew Valley. Friends of Mineral Town originally launched in 2003 for Game Boy Advance as Harvest Moon: Back to Nature. In 2019 it received got a Switch remake/rename, which was ported to PC in 2020 and to PS4 and XO in late 2021.\\nThe story involves coming to restore and manage an inherited farmland nearby a rural town, and if that sounds familiar, you’re not wrong. The main difference between SoS: Friends of Mineral Town and Stardew Valley is that SoS is in 3D, but otherwise you’re going to feel right at home caring for plants and livestock, visiting town and its many inhabitants, and living your best life.\\nAlthough Farm Together can absolutely be played solo, one of tis draws is your ability to work on your plot of land with other people. Whether it’s a carefully selected group of friends or a public farm, you can invite some helping hands to your farm. Farm Together is so committed to multiplayer that it features even local co-op for up to 4, provided you have the necessary controllers.\\nWhat might make Farm Together into an experience that’s less thoroughly chill than other games on this list is that time advances even when you’re not playing. If that doesn’t bother you, then you’re in for some solid farming and crafting gameplay, easily shared with others. There’s also a neat, but ultimately inconsequential addition in the form of a customizable pet that’s going to follow you around.\\nSlime Rancher is a delightful game. The titular slimes are blobby, friendly-looking creatures, which seem perfectly happy being vacuumed into a fancy backpack to be released into their enclosures later. A bulk of the game is spent collecting the slimes and feeding them their favorite food so that they produce “plorts” for you to sell on the market.\\nNewbucks earned this way can be spent on upgrades for your ranch. Despite two differences that can be spotted right away—the first-person camera and a friendly-looking 3-dimensional world—the idea of maintaining and managing your own ranch, complete with growing food for your slimes to eat, and selling produce on a market are obvious similarities to ConcernedApe’s game.\\n|Developer||Lazy Bear Games|\\nGraveyard Keeper is a curious game which possibly wouldn’t have come to be without the popularity of Stardew Valley. It is a humorous game about being a person who needs to run a cemetery of a Medieval town. You select the plots for the graves, conduct autopsies on corpses before preparing them for the coffin, you also can participate in events in the nearby town, such as burning of a heretic…\\nThere’s a lot to do in this game, and we haven’t even covered crafting or tending to your own vegetable patch. The game is obviously comedic in nature, as opposed to serene sincerity of Stardew Valley or bubbly friendliness of Slime Rancher, but it’s still quite an interesting management game with an unusual premise. It’s effectively SDV but about running a cemetery.\\nMy Time At Portia\\nReleased in 2019, My Time at Portia has a premise very similar to Stardew Valley. While in SDV your character gets a farm from their grandmother, in MTAP it’s a workshop inherited from their father. Oh, and the world is recovering from apocalyptic destruction. Otherwise, in both games you need to turn a failing property into a thriving business through hard work and micromanaging.\\nJust like in SDV you also get to make many new friends, rebuild the town to improve the life of the community, and make your way through dungeons stretching deep and wide beneath the town. If you can brave the dangers it hides, the spoils will be yours for the taking. My Time At Portia is quite happy to let you do anything you find exciting: exploring, pursuing crafting projects, or maybe just fishing.\\n|Genre:||Simulation, Farming Sim|\\nWhile Stardew Valley has a definitely Western theme (it could easily take place in Europe or the United States), The Islander is more Polynesia-inspired. Your plot of land is an actual island somewhere on the ocean, and among the more mundane plants, like wheat or turnips you can also farm kiwifruit or pineapples. The livestock you can care for include pandas among the familiar cows and chickens.\\nDespite the change of scenery, many aspects stay the same. Your goal is still to establish your own farm in a limited area. Harvest crops, rear animals, build and decorate your house, you probably know how it works. If you fancy a setting different from SDV’s, check this one out. There’s also a second game, The Islander: Town Architect, which has a significantly less rural theme.\\nStaxel is a middle point between Minecraft’s blocky aesthetic and Stardew Valley’s core gameplay. Everything you’d expect after having played SDV is in here: growing crops, taking care of livestock, making friends, shaping the land to suit your needs. It’s just that instead of 2D, old school pixels you’re dealing with a fully 3D environment created out of small, 3D voxels.\\nContrary to Stardew Valley, Staxel was also designed with multiplayer in mind, so it has a number of well-integrated functionalities if you want to share the fun with your friends. Staxel is also mod-friendly, including an integration with the Workshop if you’re playing on Steam, so you have a measure of flexibility when it comes to customizing your game world to suit your needs.\\nKynseed looks every bit like Stardew Valley, but it is also quite different from it in several crucial aspects. While SDV exists in a timeless land where people don’t get old, Kynseed is all about the passage of years and adding building blocks to your family’s prosperity and legacy. It also includes forming long-time relationships and building a reputation, both positive and negative.\\nYou get to run a farm, of course, but you can also occasionally play pranks on your neighbors, explore the lore of the fantasy land the game takes place in, or trade years of your life to a mysterious being for magic items. Whatever one generation manages to accomplish is passed on to the next, including wealth and powers gained from adventures.\\nReap the spoils\\nThis concludes our list of farming games with additional focus on community simulation and friendly aesthetics. Whether the similarity lies in the farming theme, the management-based gameplay, or something as elusive as a family legacy, there’s something here for everyone and there’s no shortage of games like Stardew Valley.',\n",

       " {'text': 'Former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina isn’t content to sit at the “kid’s table” of 2016 presidential pundits any longer, and on Wednesday her campaign argued why she shouldn’t during the next GOP debate hosted by CNN in September.\\n“Carly won the debate[s] on August 6th. In the three national polls that have been released since the debate, Carly is between 4th and 7th place. Her name ID and net favorability have risen by double digits,” Sarah Isgur Flores, Fiorina’s deputy campaign manager, wrote in a Medium post Wednesday.\\n“Despite being solidly in the top 10 by every measure, the political establishment is still rigging the game to keep Carly off the main debate stage next month.”\\nThe campaign criticized the Republican National Committee for the news outlets the RNC selected to host the primary debates, including Fox News and CNN, as well as the criteria those outlets adopted to designate first and second tier debate lineups for the crowded 17-candidate field.\\nIn the first debate earlier this month, Fox News used the last five polls prior to the debate to decide which 10 candidates would get top billing, and relegated the rest to a pre-primetime “happy hour debate.”\\nFiorina, who was trailing 14th at the time, gave an undebatable top performance according to virtually every news outlet, and has since risen to tie Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker for 4th place with 9 percent according to the latest Rasmussen Reports national telephone survey, and 7th place with 5 percent according to ORC International’s most recent poll.\\nThose numbers aren’t enough to move Fiorina to primetime based on CNN’s criteria, which will divide candidates for first and second billing based on the average of 10 polls released between July 16 and Sept. 10. Eight of those polls were conducted prior to Fiorina’s first debate win.\\nThat means CNN will be weighing the three weeks of polling prior to the first debate three times as heavily as the three weeks since Fiorina’s victory.\\n“The RNC should ask CNN to treat the polling in July the same as the polling that comes after,” Flores wrote. “Because there were nine polls released in the three weeks before the last debate, one would expect 18 polls released in the six weeks between the two debates.”\\n“If that does not happen, the polling average of those six weeks should be treated as the equivalent of 18 polls. Assuming the numbers remain consistent with current polling, Carly would easily place in the top 10 for the main debate.”\\nSince only two CNN-approved pollsters have released results since the first debate, weighing the polls since July equally is tantamount to “putting their thumb on the scale and choosing to favor candidates with higher polling for three weeks in July over candidates with measurable momentum in August and September,” according to the campaign.\\n“It will be interesting to see if CNN has no qualms excluding someone who is polling in the top 5 in Iowa and New Hampshire, in second place in multiple states, and well within the top 10 nationally,” Flores wrote. “And it will be disappointing if Reince Priebus and the Republican establishment stand by and let a TV network keep Carly off the main stage…again.”\\nThough a number of polls have yet to release new results since the first debate, including ABC News/Washington Post, Bloomberg, CBS News, Monmouth University, Quinnipiac University and others, it’s unlikely CNN will have 18 to weigh prior to the Sept. 16 debate.\\nBased on an average of polls that qualify now, Fiorina is in 12th place with just under 2 percent.\\n“I didn’t think the Fox News rules were particularly good using national polls, I don’t think the CNN rules are particularly good, especially since they go all the way back through mid-July,” Fiorina said on MSNBC’s “Morning Joe” Wednesday. “But you know what? I don’t have any impact over the rules. I think it’s why people are losing trust in the media, frankly, and are upset in many cases with the RNC.”\\n“But what I’m going to do is what I’ve been doing, which is, take advantage of every opportunity I’m given, and get out there and talk to as many voters as I can, eyeball to eyeball, face to face, hear personally what their concerns are and answer every single question they have.”',\n",

       " {'text': 'Anchored by Jake Tapper, The Lead airs at 4 p.m. ET on CNN.\\nWe\\'ve moved! Come join us at our new show page.\\nDuring his own opening statement, Major Nidal Hasan said, \"the evidence will clearly show that I am the shooter.\"\\nHasan is on trial in Texas for the Fort Hood shooting spree that took place November 5, 2009. He is charged with killing 13 people and wounding 32 others on that day.\\nIf he is found guilty, at least one man who witnessed the attack wants him to face the ultimate punishment.\\n\"The death penalty is reserved for those who do the most heinous of crimes, and they need to pay for their crimes, if they do what this individual did by killing 13 men and women,\" said former Army Sgt. Howard Ray. \"I think the punishment should be reserved for him.\"\\nRay was awarded the Army Commendation Medal for his actions that day at Fort Hood. He was credited for saving the lives of six soldiers and three civilians.\\nOn that day, when Ray first saw Hasan shooting, he ushered a woman out of the building they were in, and the two of them hid behind a car. He heard someone yelling that the shooter was coming around the corner of the building. Ray instinctively swept his shirt back to grab his pistol, but he was in civilian clothes, and had left his weapon at home.\\nRay made a fast decision to run with the woman to the back side of the parking lot where there was coverage – but Hasan shot at them along the way.\\nTo be \"shot at on a military installation is obviously something you don\\'t go to work to experience,\" said Ray, \"It certainly was a shock.\"\\nFor Ray, the most devastating part of that day is that he had a clean shot of Hasan, but couldn\\'t take it.\\nRay said the Army missed warning signs that could have prevented the attack, such as Hasan\\'s officer evaluation report.\\n\"He was subpar, calling out for such things as jihad, and that he was a soldier of Allah, and things of that nature,\" said Ray.\\nSince he is defending himself, Hasan could very well end up cross-examining the very people he\\'s accused of trying to kill.\\nHasan is a psychiatrist - a man trained to get into people\\'s heads. On the day of the attack, prosecutors say he walked into a waiting room at the army base with a semi-automatic pistol and just started firing.\\nThe attack did not stop until a civilian police officer, Sgt. Kimberly Munley, arrived on the scene and shot Hasan, suffering three gunshots herself.\\nHasan is now in a wheelchair, paralyzed from the waist-down. His trial was supposed to begin 18 months ago, but a series of legal fights delayed it, over everything from Hasan\\'s representation, to whether he was allowed to keep his beard for religious reasons.\\nHasan freely admits carrying out this rampage. But he was not allowed to enter a guilty plea under military law, because prosecutors are seeking the death penalty.\\nThe FBI has released e-mails between Hasan and Anwar al-Awlaki, the radical American-born cleric who was a purported force behind al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. Al Awlaki was killed in a drone strike in Yemen in 2011.\\nThe very first e-mail shows Hasan asking al Awlaki whether Islamic law would permit the killing of American soldiers.\\nYet, even with that e-mail out there, the Pentagon is not officially calling this a terror attack, preferring the term \"workplace violence,\" Which makes a serious difference in benefits for survivors and victims\\' families.\\nPentagon sources tell CNN that if they were to call the attack an act of terrorism, and award soldiers for acts of bravery that day, they would be giving Hasan a way to claim that there is no way he could get a fair trial; the Pentagon would have effectively already decided he was guilty of having committed a terrorist act.\\n\"We can play semantics, you know, calling it one thing or not the other, the bottom line is it is terrorism, and I don\\'t think that necessarily would inhibit him from getting a fair trial,\" said Ray.\\n\"Victims like myself and others, we deserve answers and we deserve closure to this event,\" said Ray. \"Here we are struggling nearly almost four years ... and we\\'re just barely starting this process.\"',\n",

       " {'text': \"Making your own french fries can sound a little tedious and yes, like a lot of work… but the end result is WELL WORTH THE EFFORT. Trust me! Nothing beats double fried homemade french fries. They taste fresh, have a great crunchy quality to them and YOU control how they are made, which beats the pants off of the science project list of ingredients you find on the package of most french fries you find in your grocer freezer isle.\\nAs a mom I am always looking for ways to make my kids healthy alternatives to store bought frozen, processed foods and for sure french fries fit the bill.\\nI have tried making homemade french fries for years and have experimented ALOT with different methods, recipes and cooking vessels. But nothing came close to a good old cast iron skillet and patience.\\nThe ultimate objective? Golden crispy fries on the outside with a light fluffy interior. When done right you won’t be able to resist eating them all. Done poorly and you wind up with a soggy, oily mess.\\nWith the right tools and a few tricks you can easily make delicious, healthy alternative french fries at home that, hands down, are far and away better than any frozen bag you grab at the store.\\nNow before we jump into the recipe there are a few tools you will want on hand and a few tips you will want to keep in mind.\\nBuy this right potatoes! Sounds simple right? But when you get into the food store you are inundated with all kinds of options to choose from… which potato makes the best french fries? My personal preference is using large Russet baking potatoes. I find other varieties to be too sweet for my liking or too small to make a nice sized french fry.\\nHave on hand a vegetable or potato slicer. This will save you tons of time and make slicing the potatoes effort less. It is a great tool to have in your kitchen gadget cabinet for all sorts of recipes including fried zucchini sticks and vegetables for the grill.\\nA fry thermometer is a must have. It is important that you know the temperature of your oil so that you can not only make adjustments to the heat level under your pan but to ensure you don’t make a soggy mess from trying to fry with oil not to temp or burning your fries with oil that is too hot. A must have for not only french fries but fried chicken, chicken fried steak, fish & chips and all sorts of recipes.\\nA good cast iron skillet can be magical! Cast iron hold heat longer and gives you more control over the temperature during frying recipes. I use mine for everything from chicken fried stead, fish & chips, to french fries and pork chops. An indispensable pan to have in any kitchen. My husband even has one he uses on the grill for his smoky crab cake recipe! And be sure to have a handle cover for your pan… you will thank me later. The handle can get very hot and unless your on the run from the law you will probably want to keep your finger prints… LOL.\\nFinally, you will want a good baking sheet and a wire rack… this will help drain off the excess oil and make your life so much easier. trying to drain the oil off on a plate will just cause a headache and create soggy fries. Trust me here! Great for all sorts of recipes including fried chicken. A little trick, save money by cutting in half brown paper shopping bags and place on top of the wire rack resting in a half sheet pan. This will reduce the number of paper towels you need and is a nice way to reduce, reuse and recycle instead of just throwing out those brown bags.\\nOK… you are now armed and ready to start making some delicious homemade french fries! Once you try this recipe you will never go back to those science fair project frozen french fries again. Hope you enjoy them! Don’t forget to make some of Mamma Rocks Burger and Fries Sauce to dip your homemade fries in!!!!! MMMMMMMM 🙂\\n- 3 to 5 pounds russet potatoes, unpeeled, scrubbed well (estimate 2 large or 3 medium potatoes per person)\\n- Vegetable oil - about 3 quarts\\n- Kosher salt - about 3 table spoons or enough to season to your liking\\n- In a 12 inch or larger cast iron skillet pour enough oil to reach about half way up the sides (do not over fill as oil will expand when heated and can overflow, additionally when you add the fries to the oil the oil will rise higher up the skillet).\\n- On the rim of the skillet clip on a fry thermometer so that it is not touching the bottom of the skillet but is submersed in the oil. Turn on burner and bring oil to 275 degrees.\\n- In a half sheet baking sheet place a wire rack topped with cut to size brown paper bags and layer paper towels on top to collect excess oil from the fries.\\n- Using a potato slicer (cut the potatoes as needed to fit into the slicer) slice desired amount of scrubbed and washed potatoes (for this recipe I typically slice 3 to 5 pounds of potatoes and yield enough fries for 6 to 8 people).\\n- In small batches place fries in oil, cook for approximately 4 to 5 minutes. The fries should not be browning for this round of frying.\\n- Remove fries from oil and place on brown bag lined rack. Repeat until all potatoes have been fried once.\\n- Raise temperature of oil to 375 degrees and place fries back in the oil in batches until golden brown. Remove fries to brown bag rack with clean paper towels on top to drain. Repeat till all fries have been cooked a second time.\\n- Season fries with salt and dip in Mamma's Burger and Fries Sauce... Enjoy!\",\n",

       " {'text': 'Sunday, November 29\\nThis morning as CountryBoy started to wash the dishes, then the eggs and try to figure out what to have for supper he stated that he was back to his routine. As I was preparing to go to work I stated that I, too, was back to my routine. Funny thing, neither one of us really care for our routines. We would much rather switch but, alas, that is not going to happen so we both do what we have to do.\\nCountryBoy cleaned the cabin while I was at work. Yep, back to our routines.\\nMonday, November 30\\nAs we sat in front of a burning fireplace this morning having our coffee while the snow was falling outside I refused to think of having to go to work in a few hours and just enjoyed the moment. I’m glad that during those moments I did not realize that today was billing day. After getting to work and sitting at my desk I happened to glance at the calendar and noticed that today was the last day of the month. That’s when it dawned on me that I had to do the billing. sigh. Three out of four accounts went well until the last account when I accidentally hit another button while closing out the month. While trying to salvage the situation I lost ALL the data for the month. not good. I ended up calling the software company to see if they could help recover the data. After several attempts the customer service rep said he had to contact the developer. We did manage to get over half of the month’s worth of data back so that’s a start and better than nothing. Fingers crossed I’ll get good news tomorrow.\\nThe rest of the evening hasn’t been that much better. I sat in front of the fire knitting and ended up ripping out several rows. After that I decided to write today’s journal entry in front of the fire and my laptop died with a battery life of 87%. sigh. I also keep getting error messages that it’s unable to save and that I may be offline while trying to blog. Me and computers just aren’t getting along today.\\nOn the plus side, it’s SNOWING!!! Not a lot but it’s snowing nonetheless which always brightens a day ’round here. The weather forecasters are calling for a couple inches. If it snows all night we just may get it! Woohoo!!!!!\\nCountryBoy took me to work this morning so he could drop the side-by-side at the shop to be checked and hopefully fixed. He also did a coupla errands. I’m always glad when he can do the errands while I’m at work!\\nTuesday, December 1\\nThe first day of December dawned with a thin layer of snow reminding us that Autumn is waning and Winter will soon be here.\\nIt was so beautiful that I momentarily forgot what was ahead of me at work.\\nHowever, as the clock neared the time of me needing to get ready for work I slowly began to wrap my head around what I needed to do today and how I would accomplish it. Thankfully I was able to get my pages laid out fairly quickly and then was able to concentrate on correcting the billing mishap of yesterday. Another phone call to the software company got me nowhere so I began to rectify the situation myself by inputting the missing data. When all was said and done there were only two invoices that needed modified so I’ll take that as a successful close of the month. whew.\\nAs I was just getting started on creating a new invoice for one of the customers I was told the boss was on her way in. I’ll be honest, I was mentally drained and I just did not have the mental capacity to talk about anything billing related so I left. I’ll be in a much better state of mind on Thursday when we’re all back at work.\\nFarm news: 12 eggs\\nWednesday, December 2\\nIt’s been another mentally exhausting day. I spent the day at the B&B behind the laptop creating a newsletter. The time consuming part are the photos – getting them, editing them and creating collages with them to place into the newsletter. Finding just the right words to say can also be tedious but once the photos are done and the wording decided the rest is pretty easy. Nonetheless, what I thought was going to be a short day ended up being a very long day. Having only one small slice of cinnamon toast and a small glass of juice to eat all day didn’t help. I didn’t even do any ironing. Hopefully there are enough sheet sets to get by until Sunday. We had tentatively planned on going to town this afternoon and doing a little bit of Christmas shopping. Needless to say, that did not happen. Thankfully CountryBoy had the leftover Chicken Cacciatore already warmed in the oven so I was able to eat shortly after getting home. I felt much better after that.\\nThis evening I’m going to knit, browse through Pinterest then go to bed. Exciting night, huh?!\\nThursday, December 3\\nMy intended evening of relaxing last night wound up leaving me restless. I quickly tired of knitting. I got bored with Pinterest and there was nothing new on my Instagram feed so my mind started wandering all over the place. I kept picking my knitting back up but my mind continued to wander. I’ve discovered that my mind wanders less when I have a project to keep myself occupied. Whether it’s in the planning stages or in the midst my mind just seems to be more at ease if it has something to focus on. I did get a good night’s sleep though so that’s good.\\nCountryBoy took me to work again today. The side-by-side was ready to be picked up. What was wrong with it? a fuse. A simple fuse. While the buggy was in the shop we had them change the oil. The rear axle will need to be replaced soon so it’s on order. Once the part comes in I will block the cabin’s calendar and we will take the buggy back in to be serviced. It’s only supposed to take about six hours so we shouldn’t have to block the cabin for very long.\\nWork was good although throughout the day I came across remnants of the billing fiasco. By the end of the day I think I managed to get everything back as it should be. We’ll see.\\nFriday, December 4\\nIt’s turkey day! CountryBoy is making me a delayed Thanksgiving dinner with all the fixins’ and I’m so excited! When he dropped off the side-by-side at the shop he stopped at the grocery store and picked up a few things. At least I thought he only picked up a few things but he actually picked up a little bit more – one of those things being a turkey. A 15 lb. turkey at that. For two people, ha! He said it was the smallest one he could find so we’ve invited another couple over to help us eat it all.\\nWe leisurely worked throughout the day making preparations – baking a punkin’ pie, making dinner rolls and leaving them lots of time to rise, cleaning, setting the table, scrubbin’ taters, and so on. Everything was so yummy! After eating more than we should we played some ‘Hog Stomp’, drank coffee and had dessert. It was a wonderful day!\\nFarm news: 12 eggs\\nSaturday, December 5\\nLast night started out to be a restless night for me. I tossed and turned for over two hours before finally falling asleep. I’m not sure whether it was the evening coffee, the excitement of the day, or both. Thankfully I woke up feeling refreshed so I must’ve managed to get enough sleep.\\nThis morning’s sunrise over the barn had such an ethereal beauty that I just had to try and capture it. Of course, photo’s never do the real thing justice but nonetheless, I wanted to share it with you…\\nIt was so beautiful!\\nThere is not a whole lot on the agenda today. I like those days. Other than the usual Saturday laundry I thought I would get our Christmas cards ready for the mail. Oh, and we have to get the cabin ready for today’s guests. It’s only been six days but it seems like longer since we’ve had any guests. The break was nice but it would be even nicer to have a few more nights booked this month.\\nWe are enjoying ‘all things turkey’ today. Even with two more mouths at yesterday’s delayed Thanksgiving feast we still had some leftovers so turkey sandwiches were enjoyed at lunch. With CountryBoy celebrating Thanksgiving at his Mom’s and me not having any turkey last week we are actually excited about leftovers. I’m sure most of you don’t even want to hear the word turkey right now!\\nAs I sat eating my turkey sandwich in front of the fireplace the pressure canner was rattling away in the kitchen. We decided to can the green beans we had blanched and froze from our summer crop before they got freezer burned. Seven more quart jars were added to the green beans we’ve already canned. I think we’ll have enough to get us through the winter! Next up will be making some grape jelly because as the gallon bags of green beans were being dug out of the freezer a plastic container of grape juice fell out and cracked. So many times our days fill up with things to do from one mishap or another. What can ya do?!\\nIt’s another turkey feast tonight. Yum! Our guests arrived earlier than expected (which is good). I did not get the Christmas cards ready for the mail nor did we make any grape jelly. But, the juice is thawed for the making of jelly another day and I’ll work on the cards throughout the week. For now? I’m going to eat then spend the evening doing whatever I feel like doing!',\n",

       " {'text': 'They can buy different policies directly from insurers for 2014 or sign up for plans on state insurance exchanges. While lower-income people could see lower costs because of government subsidies, many in the middle class may get rude awakenings when they access the websites and realize they’ll have to pay significantly more.\\nThose not eligible for subsidies generally receive more comprehensive coverage than they had under their soon-to-be-canceled policies, but they’ll have to pay a lot more.\\nBecause of the higher cost, the Griffins are considering paying the federal penalty — about $100 or 1 percent of income next year — rather than buying health insurance. They say they are healthy and don’t typically run up large health care costs. Dean Griffin said that will be cheaper because it’s unlikely they will get past the nearly $13,000 deductible for the coverage to kick in.\\nIndividual health insurance policies are being canceled because the Affordable Care Act requires plans to cover certain benefits, such as maternity care, hospital visits and mental illness. The law also caps annual out-of-pocket costs consumers will pay each year.\\nIn the past, consumers could get relatively inexpensive, bare-bones coverage, but those plans will no longer be available. Many consumers are frustrated by what they call forced upgrades as they’re pushed into plans with coverage options they don’t necessarily want.\\nKen Davis, who manages a fast food restaurant in Austin, Texas, is recovering from sticker shock after the small-business policy offered by his employer was canceled for the same reasons individual policies are being discontinued.\\nHis company pays about $100 monthly for his basic health plan. He said he’ll now have to pay $600 monthly for a mid-tier silver plan on the state exchange. The family policy also covers his 8-year-old son. Even though the federal government is contributing a $500 subsidy, he said the $600 he’s left to pay is too high. He’s considering the penalty.\\n“I feel like they’re forcing me to do something that I don’t want to do or need to do,” Davis, 40, said.\\nOwners of canceled policies have a few options. They can stay in the same plan for the same price for one more year if they have one of the few plans that were grandfathered in. They can buy a similar plan with upgraded benefits that meets the new standards — likely at a significant cost increase. Or, if they make less than $45,960 for a single adult or $94,200 for a family of four, they may qualify for subsidies.\\nJust because a policy doesn’t comply with the law doesn’t mean consumers will get cancellation letters. They may get notices saying existing policies are being amended with new benefits and will come with higher premiums. Some states, including Virginia and Kentucky, required insurers to cancel old policies and start from scratch instead of beefing up existing ones.\\nIt’s unclear how many individual plans are being canceled — no one agency keeps track. But it’s likely in the millions. Insurance industry experts estimate that about 14 million people, or 5 percent of the total market for health care coverage, buy individual policies. Most people get coverage through jobs and aren’t affected.\\nMany states require insurers to give consumers 90 days’ notice before canceling plans. That means another round of cancellation letters will go out in March and again in May.\\nExperts haven’t been able to predict how many will pay more or less under the new, upgraded plans. An older policyholder with a pre-existing condition may find that premiums go down, and some will qualify for subsidies.\\nAbout 330,000 Floridians received cancellation notices from the state’s largest insurer, Florida Blue. About 30,000 have plans that were grandfathered in. Florida insurance officials said they’re not tracking the number of canceled policies related to the new law.\\nNational numbers are similar: 130,000 cancellations in Kentucky, 140,000 in Minnesota and as many as 400,000 in Georgia, according to officials in those states.',\n",

       " {'text': 'Job interviews. They’re a necessary evil, yes? We need the job, this is part of the process to getting it. It’s crazy scary because everything depends on this conversation with strangers who are going to make a decision about your life. The stakes are high. You absolutely need to nail your job interview.\\nThis is so important that we need to be completely prepared. One of my “jokes” is that we go through many years of schooling, we gain onsite experience and then we get to a job interview and we’re nervous as heck and stammering all over the place! Drawing a blank. Losing sleep in advance.\\nHere are some steps to getting you absolutely ready to nail your job interview & land your dream job.\\nDo Your Due Diligence about the Firm\\nGet all the facts about the firm that you can. Know the directors and other key players. Know their clients and the projects they’re working on. Get to know their mission statement. Also, know the job you’re applying for. This way you’ll appear to be educated about the firm. They’ll love that. And think about the reaction if they discover you don’t know important information about the firm! That’s not going to help you nail your job interview!\\nDress For Success\\nWear the clothes that are appropriate for the job itself but step it up a notch. If your job requires that you wear a suit, wear a suit, but add a pocket square and some great shoes.\\nIf you want to nail your job interview, your attire will make an impression. People don’t always analyze specifically what you’re wearing but the impression they get is subconscious. It’ll help you to fit in even before you’ve gotten the job.\\nRoleplay the Answers to Questions\\nWe know many of the questions that interviewers may ask us. For example, “What are your strengths & what are your weaknesses?” “Why are you leaving your current job?” “Were there any difficulties you’ve faced & how did you deal with them?” etc. etc. There may be you-specific questions that you’re concerned about. Perhaps you were fired from your last job & you need to explain. Or maybe you have a few years unaccounted for on your resume. These are stories that you need to prepare.\\nDon’t Be Afraid of Your Recorder. It is Your Best Friend.\\nThe only way to nail your job interview is to be super-prepared. First, answer these questions into a recorder. Then listen to your answers and revise them in a written format. You’ll likely be making your answers a bit shorter & more concise. Think of just the important facts and remove the superfluous words & phrases. Next, read the answers aloud into a recorder again. And finally record the answers to the questions off-the-cuff again.\\nI do a lot of interview practice with my clients. Just yesterday a client asked if you should just keep talking and leave no pauses. I was appalled! He said he had a professor who told him to just keep talking and to avoid pauses. That’s what inspired me to write this post. Read on & you’ll see what I mean about pauses.\\nAlso, I want you to really understand and master why this firm should hire you. Record yourself. When you hear something you don’t like it means that you have a weakness regarding that concept. Think about it and work on it. Even if they don’t ask you this specific question make a point of letting them know why they should hire you.\\nYou need to get rid of tension in your body & specifically in your vocal mechanism. Do relaxation exercises and make “being relaxed” a habit in your life. Job interviews make people tense. They literally tighten their vocal mechanisms which results in a pitch that’s too high and a voice that’s very thin-essentially lacking executive presence.\\nIt also unfortunately makes people talk too fast, forget what they wanted to say, and use closed body language. The tension that we feel before & during job interviews can cause our skill level to drop.\\nWhat happens as a result of this tension and our skill levels dropping & talking too fast, etc. is that people don’t see how amazing you are. You can’t have your interviewers not seeing how amazing you are. Not if you want to nail your job interview.\\nDon’t just be on time. Be early. Get to the waiting area & check in with the receptionist. You can use this time to do your deep breathing exercises. Also, use the time to do your relaxation exercises. Employers want to hire people who are early. If you plan to be on time anything can happen (traffic, accidents, subway is slow…) & you may be late. No one wants to hire someone who’s late for the job interview.\\nYour Speech & Voice can Make or Break You\\nUse lots of air when you speak. Practice with a recorder-you’ll be surprised at how you sound so authoritative, yet warm. Speech is acoustically air molecules that vibrate. The more air you use the more resonance you have thus the more authoritative you sound.\\nJust Replace Your Filler Words with Pauses.\\nUse pauses. I can’t emphasize this enough. Pauses give you a chance to take a breath (which provides your brain with oxygen!) And remember this: when you’re speaking too fast & without pauses the interviewer can’t keep up. You’re in the future, your listeners are in the past. Taking a breath keeps everyone in the present.\\nMake sure the end of your utterances are short in duration and quiet in volume. This eliminates “upspeak” and drag.” Drag is little known and oft used. It’s when a speaker lengthens their last syllable in a phrase or sentence.\\nBe concise. When you keep your concepts light & clean it helps the interviewer to understand your message. You need this to nail your job interview!\\nMaster Your Small Talk\\nSmall talk is anything but small. Most people are afraid of it or despise it. That’s because they’re doing it wrong. You can learn to use small talk to instantly create very strong bonds with others.\\nI arm my clients with an arsenal of anecdotes. But you can do this yourself. You just master some stories that get others thinking and talking. Did you ever hear someone tell a story & you instantly wanted to tell the story that it made you think of? That person is likely a great story-teller.\\nUse this technique to get others to relate to you. Keep your stories super short but really engaging.\\nUse Warm & Open Body Language\\nMake sure you sit with your back straight, your arms apart & your head held high. Sit at the back of your chair. This will not only make the interviewers instinctively trust & like you but it will cause you to feel more confident. It’s science. 🙂\\nWhen I was in 11th grade I was so excited to go to the amusement park at the end of the year. I looked forward to it the entire school year. My friends & I were there, having a great time & decided to get our picture taken as we were going down a roller coaster. The photographer said, “Don’t put your head down, keep your head up! People put their head down when they’re afraid and we won’t be able to see you in the pic.” Well wouldn’t you know it, I couldn’t keep my head up! I physically had no control over my head! My friends were so mad that I had ruined the picture!\\nYour Body Can Control You or You Can Control it.\\nOn that roller coaster my fear controlled my body. I knew I needed to keep my head up but I couldn’t do it. Obviously I needed to do my relaxation exercises. 🙂 It took a few roller coaster rides to get my head to stay up, but when I did I was really able to enjoy the ride.\\nI had an amazing female c-suite client who was often in a board room with only men. She was aware that she was really quite nervous. The first thing we did was train her to relax in that room. That included her body language. She initially was unable to sit at the back of her chair! She sat at the edge of her seat. It took a couple of weeks to get her at the back of the chair. But when she did she had so much more control over her body, her speech & the others in the room. She became a leader.\\nSo remember, don’t cross your legs or your arms. Keep your extremities as far from midline as possible. This results in your being able to keep control of yourself, your speech & other people. That’s leadership.\\nAlways be open to hearing what your interviewers are really saying. When you’re not ultra clear as to what they’ve said, do repeat what you think they said in different language. Using different words. This show’s them that you’re thoughtful & not impulsive.\\nTake a beat to process their questions before answering. Don’t be afraid of silence. What may seem like an eternity to you is probably just a second. This gives you the opportunity to design your answer concisely & with persuasion. The sooner you start speaking the greater the chance that you’ll use fillers, run on sentences and really big no-content words. The ones I call grammar glue (ands, ifs & buts.)\\nHere’s how to eliminate filler words forever.\\nLeave some air space for them to react to what you’ve said. All this is part of the recipe for you to nail your job interview!\\nHave Intelligent Questions Prepared\\nHow stupid do you feel when the interviewer says, “Do you have any questions for me?” And you’re all, “No, not right now; I’ll email you if I think of any…” If you want to nail your job interview you should have questions prepared.\\nAnother article from Monster has some questions you can ask during an interview. I think a few of them are a bit obnoxious & could be toned down. Just use them as examples to help you in your specific job quest. This results in your interviewers seeing that you’re really interested and the right person for the job.\\nNecessary cookies are absolutely essential for the website to function properly.

       " {'text': 'Creative Writing in a Chemotherapy Infusion Center\\nIf it’s Wednesday, you won’t find me in my office, not at my desk at home nor the one at work. You won’t find me at the quirky Blue Moose Café, or The Grind just off campus, indulging in reading and writing with a healthy dose of caffeine. You won’t find me in the Robinson Reading Room of the Wise Library at West Virginia University. Instead, you might find me riding the Personal Rapid Transit, or PRT, a monorail that connects the various WVU campuses around Morgantown, traveling from downtown to the Health Science Center. When the doors open at the depot, you might find me climbing stairs and walking across the parking lot towards the Mary Babb Randolph Cancer Institute, making my way to the second floor of the building, to the chemotherapy infusion center. It’s here that I spend Wednesdays, working with patients with cancer, although I’m not a doctor or a nurse. I’m a creative writer. Instead of taking a patient’s vitals, I’m there to take his or her story.\\nThe chemotherapy infusion center is a large box; the outside of the box is lined with cubbies, with three walls and a curtain that slides across for some additional privacy. The box’s center contains nurses stations, computers that can be wheeled around to cubbies, The kind of instruments and gear you’d expect to see in a bustling clinic. When I arrive I check in with the charge nurse. She’ll direct me to patients who I might have deliveries for—deliveries not of flowers or lunch but of stories—and or direct me to new patients to work with. New patients, new stories.\\nIn October 2015, I met with Dr. Carl Grey. Carl, a young doctor, has a compact, athletic build, blonde hair, thick glasses and a shy smile. He married a woman I knew from grad school who runs the literary imprint of the WVU Press. In my mind, this makes them a power couple. Carl had a clever idea—that patients would be more open to tough conversations with their physicians if those patients had reflected on their lives and values first, and doctors could know those lives and values through expressive writing. But he wasn’t sure how to get started.\\nI’d worked with a dying man, about a year before, helping him craft a memoir. During this time I learned about narrative medicine, and attended workshops run by Rita Charon, MD, PhD. I like to call her St. Rita, because I find her work a miracle. St. Rita believes stories matter, and that the care of sick unfolds in stories. She believes that through these stories we bear witness to lives, and through writing and reading we join in attention, representation and affiliation in ways that make order from chaos. Through my work writing with patients with cancer, I find my view in line with hers. In the chemotherapy infusion center, I get some of those stories, the stories of the patients. I don’t ask about their cancer explicitly, but of course the patients can talk about that if they want. In West Virginia, where I live and work, patients like to talk about work, food, and family. I can’t tell you how many stories include parts of recipes and the food eaten at family events—from barbecue to soup beans, fried chicken to Hawaiian meatballs. Gardens, too. Tomatoes, squash, beans, lettuce, you name it. In West Virginia, telling a good story is considered an art of its own.\\nMy storytelling patients range from late teens to over 80 years old. They are all receiving chemotherapy for some kind of cancer, some in early stage, others progressed. Not all, but most are Appalachian, many natives of West Virginia who still live here.\\nPart of the reason I’ve talked in summary about the patient stories is that, under our project, they’re protected by HIPAA. That allows the patient to be in control of their story. We do survey them to see where they end up. Most are shared with family members and friends.\\nTo get a patient story, I sit with each, working through a release form and some surveys. One survey collects quality of life information and another collects demographic data. Both will be logged in a secure database so we can analyze the results later. We have a study group and a control group. The study group begins the storytelling immediately, while control group does the story portion at a later date. I’d never thought of writing in these terms before, and it’s interesting learning this world of research. I go through guided questions to get at stories and while I do this I record the conversation. Later, this recording is worked up into a transcript, and from that transcript I work on a first-person account. When I have the story ready, I bring it to the patient in a crisp blue folder. Patients read through and can make any edits they need or want to make. When their story is finished, it’s theirs to keep and share. Most of the patients I work with have never thought to write anything down about their lives, and when I bring their stories, they get excited to read them. One patient, having a tough day in the clinic, actually went from slumped and ashen looking to sitting up, with brightness in his eyes. Carl has often said the stories turned out more beautifully that he imagined. We do file a copy for the study, and he reads every one.\\nCarl and I worked for about six months on grants to help make this project a reality. There have been plenty of supporters, and just as many naysayers. We forged on through the conviction of our belief and a lot of long arduous days writing and revising grant proposals. It pays off: of the first group of patients we’ve worked with, about 20% have been referred for symptom management or participated in Advance Care Planning because of the story project. Advance Care Planning is a set of directives patients create so that their wishes for their care are carried out if they are unable to speak for themselves. It shows one way the arts can have a palpable affect in a life, and how humanities and STEM are better together than in competition. The stories actually lead to improved care.\\nI like to think I might help change health care for the better. I am a rheumatoid arthritis patient, a condition that cut short my progress as a ballet dancer. Writing became a way to deal with that loss, and to forge a new identity. My younger brother is a cancer patient. Diagnosed young, cancer wasn’t just a shock to him but our whole family. Writing has helped me be a better caregiver and sister to him. My brother shares in the excitement about the ways in which writing life stories might better the relationship between doctors and patients.\\nOur writing in the cancer institute is a two-year pilot project. I don’t know what will come at the end of that time. I hope I’ll be able to do more work like the writing I do with patients with cancer. I feel touched, honored, and blessed to work with them. Most of all, I feel humbled. I find myself the caretaker of stories, and it’s an important job.\\nBecause of this project, a group of patients with cancer will have a part of their life on the page. What I wish and hope is that these stories are meaningful artifacts for these patients and their families. For my share, the process of making the stories creates meaning for me, and buoys my faith in all the good things that writing can do. I’ve been asked if I get depressed going to work in the infusion center, but truth told, Wednesdays are the best day of my week. I know patients don’t wish to be in the infusion center. Maybe the making of these stories makes their time in the infusion center a little bit better.\\nMy work infuses me with hope, spreading through me as if through an IV. A great hope is that more creative writers might have opportunities to do this kind of work. There are many programs people can attend—from the workshops and Masters program at Columbia University, under St. Rita, to more humble workshops, like the one I’m adding to the annual West Virginia Writers’ Workshop. Learning about how others write with patients can lead to new projects and initiatives. I recently learned about the Art for Healing at Yale New Haven Hospital’s Children’s, a program that integrates many art forms in support of healing. There are many, many more. We need to harness this collective power of art and healing. Writing can be a way to personal fulfillment, but writing can also be in service to others. This is one small way. If we have enough small ways, we have something big, changing way we live in the world, word by word, story by story. If we can do it in the heart of Appalachia, where, it seems, nothing comes easy, then I think we can spread it to all the places where people look for care. St. Rita says, “Stories matter.” Believe her.',\n",

In her first two years in the gig, she has worked to open up the professional association to the city it serves.\\n\"If we\\'re going to say we\\'re the voice of real estate for Chicago, we should mean all of Chicago,\" she says.\\nIn the Austin neighborhood, CAR and the DePaul University\\'s Chaddick Institute are studying a run-down CTA bus terminal at Austin Boulevard and Division Street. \"We\\'re trying to see if improvements would get traction for more improvements around it,\" she says.

       " {'text': \"This discussion and video relates to the basic rehabilitation principles for this procedure. The narrative is below the video.\\nTranscript of video narrative\\nThis video is an interview with Dorte Nielsen, who is a specialist physiotherapist from Copenhagen in Denmark. She is the owner of ProAlign Sports Physical Therapy, which is a progressive practice located within one of Copenhagen's largest fitness centers and with state of the art equipment. Pro Align prides itself in rehabilitating injuries quickly and efficiently, and accepts referrals from sports men and women right up to Olympic level.\\nI was made aware of Dorte during my interviews with Dr Lars Blønd when we were discussing the procedure of arthroscopic trochleoplasty for patients who have had recurrent patellar dislocation consequent on the developmental abnormality of trochlear dysplasia, where the combination of an abnormally shallow groove for the kneecap and a bony lump in the wrong place on the femur bone combine to allow ready dislocation of the kneecap. Dr Blønd dissects and lifts up the joint cartilage in the affected area, reshapes the groove, pares down the bony lump and secures the joint car\\nDr Blønd’s arthroscopic trochleoplasty patients are usually discharged the same day and are given a routine to follow at home until they come into Dorte’s clinic after two or three days.\\nHow does the rehab of arthroscopic trochleoplasty differ?\\nI asked Dorte how the rehab of arthroscopic trochleoplasty differs from patients with other patellar surgery and she explained that the main issue after surgery was the marked swelling (or oedema) from the trochleoplasty as well as pain if the MPFL ligament had also been reconstructed. This MPFL ligament is a stabiliser that is often torn in patients who have suffered patellar dislocations.\\nShe explained that rehabilitation in these arthroscopic trochleoplasty patients is not all that different from most knee patients, focusing initially on regaining full knee extension -\\nRegaining extension can be problematic in situations where the knee has not been through its full range of movement for some time, and where it has been maintained slightly bent because of pain or oedema. Failure to walk normally allows the knee capsule at the back of the knee to tighten up, and also the tendons of the hamstrings muscles at the back of the knee become tight.\\nAt their clinic they have a gravity-altering treadmill, where patients can exercise within a special pocket of air that can reduce weight-bearing in increments down to as low as 20% of the normal body weight. Dorte explained -\\nShe also talked about weakness of the quadriceps muscle, particularly the part of it called the VMO (or vastus medialis obliquus), and how they use electrical stimulation to get the VMO activated and firing normally again as well as the use of compression legware to keep the swelling down -\\n“That is my experience with it. And then also we use the electrical stimulation. Actually I just had an interesting case where I was on vacation so the patient was started later than what I would normally do, and she is a little behind in the normal rehab process. We started it this last week and now we are finally seeing the improvement. It has been very interesting because she could not do a straight leg raise whereas I normally would have the patient be able to do it in two weeks. And she couldn’t and she is in the third week right now and now she is starting to be able to do it after we have activated the VMO and getting rid of some of the oedema.”\\n“Also we have had a lot of communication about the compression, because I think that it is very important that they have the compression on at all times after surgery. That means also a compression sock, and then they have the compression bandage around too. And they have it on all times except when they are doing the exercises. Because it has a tendency to swell a lot and the swelling limits their range of motion. It would also increase the pain and pressure on the nerve endings, thereby there would be more limping and they would use their crutches longer. If we get the swelling out of the joint easier with the compression, then we will get the range of motion faster too. And we will increase the circulation by having them on a stationary bike. We just slowly sit them and do like oscillations on the bike - so they are not pedally around because then can’t do that yet - but with a high seat , and then just sitting there moving the pedals a little bit back and forth. And then on the anti-gravity machine also to get them onto a decreased weight bearing so that we can normalise their gait easier, and they feel safe.”\\nDorte explained how closely they keep in contact with the patient’s surgeon -\\n“I would think that we have about 50% knee problems - lower extremity problems. Primarily I work closely with Lars Blønd, and there are other knee surgeons who also refer patients to us, but primarily we have all of his trochleoplasty patients here and have a very close correspondence with him every day when the patient has been here. We correspond with him about the procedure, and when to increase or decrease and if there are any problems. Also when things are going really well, we videotape it and mail it to him so that he knows what is going on with his patient. So we have a very close correspondence with the surgeons here.”\\n“He is very very good at responding quickly. I know if I write him and he is by the computer I will get a fast answer which is better for the patient because then I can adjust my treatment that day, and I won’t have to wait three or four days which is a long time in rehab. And not all therapists are good at responding fast, and not all doctors are that great at it so I think it is important that you have a good team around you that can be the best for the patient. And you take that extra time every day to do it - that’s also key.”\",\n",

       " {'text': 'More than a year after the COVID-19 pandemic began, scientists still don’t fully understand how the coronavirus impacts most animal species.\\nWhile studying COVID in wild animals may not be as crucial as deploying the vaccine, knowing how and whether the coronavirus infects different species could be an important tool in the fight to stop the pandemic, two Tufts University scientists wrote in The Conversation. Viruses tend to mutate as they jump among different species through a process called host adaptation, so the two infectious disease scientists are systematically monitoring how and when that happens in wild animals.\\n“While it’s not yet clear what impact, if any, these mutations may have on human disease or the vaccine,” Tufts infectious disease and veterinary medicine experts Jonathan Runstadler and Kaitlin Sawatzki wrote in The Conversation, “these are signs of host adaptation that could allow novel variants of the virus to persist and reemerge from animal hosts in the future.”\\nFor instance, theoretical animals could spread their mutated version of the coronavirus back to humans and, if that mutated strain can better survive the vaccines we already developed, humanity would have a bad situation on its hands.\\nThe duo is collecting samples from veterinarians and other researchers who work with wildlife to search for signs of the coronavirus. Thankfully, after poring over samples from 300 animals among 20 species including bats, coyotes, and seals, they haven’t found a single positive case.\\nHowever, we do know that wild animals can be infected — the Department of Agriculture confirmed that a wild mink in Utah had the coronavirus in December, and Denmark killed 17 million minks after outbreaks began on local farms. There have been confirmed cases of people spreading COVID-19 to their pets, and even zoo gorillas have caught the bug.\\n“The discovery of the infected wild mink confirmed our fears,” the scientists wrote. “Seeing the first wild animal with natural COVID-19 is alarming, but sadly, not surprising.”\\nShare This Article\\nREAD MORE: Is COVID-19 infecting wild animals?

       " {'text': 'Floor Sanding Screens for Buffers\\nWhat is a Floor Sanding Screen?\\nFloor sanding screens are either round or rectangular buffer attachments used for the first step of the floor screening and recoating process. They are constructed with open-weave nylon webbing that is embedded with silicon carbide abrasive grains. This open-weave mesh design allows you to remove old finishes and scuffs from floors without damaging the surface below the finish.\\nWhile the screens are exceptionally resistant to loading, some does occur during use. These are two sided and can be flipped over to speed up your work extend the life of the product. Another benefit of the webbing design is that it makes the pads waterproof. This allows you to screen floors in a wet environment and also gives you the ability to rinse the screens between uses, which makes them useful for a much longer time.\\nAre they Just Wood Floor Screens?\\nNo. The screens can be used on a variety of surfaces. Wood is the most common surface for sanding screens to be used on, but the mesh screen with silicon carbide grains can also be used on other surfaces such as concrete, drywall, tile, sheetrock, marble, and other natural and artificial stones.\\nFloor Screening vs Sanding\\nScreening floors is generally done when your coating is in need of a new finish, but the underlying wood is still in good condition. It is a quick and cost effective way of keeping a healthy finish on hardwood floors.\\nFloor sanding is a much more labor-intensive job that needs to be done when there is damage to the floor like dents, deep scratches, wear and tear from heavy foot traffic, and stains. Screens give you a cost-friendly option if you cheese to keep your floors in immaculate condition rather than waiting until they need to be completely resurfaced.\\nTypes of Sanding Screens for Floors\\nRound Floor Buffer Sanding Screens\\nThese round screens range in size from 17” across to 20” across and can be used similarly to a floor sanding discs or round floor buffing pads. Floor buffer machines will continuously spin the screen like a giant orbital sander.\\nCompatible Machines - Orbital floor buffing machines\\nFloor edgers work similarly to the full size floor buffers, but smaller and handheld. Their design allows you to screen and buff flooring all the way up to the edges of a room.\\nCompatible Machines - Floor edger sanders such as, but not limited to, Clarke floor edger, a Hold edger sander, a Porter Cable floor edger sander, and Skil edger\\n12x18 Sand Screen Sheets\\nWhen most people think of a floor buffing machine, they’ll usually picture the giant round floor buffer. There are also floor buffers and sanders that have a rectangular shape, sometimes called square orbital sanders...even though they aren’t an actual square. To sand and finish flooring, the machine vibrates and makes small but fast rotations to cause friction against the floor surface.\\nThese types of floor sanding screen sheets can be used on the entire floor, against the edges of the room like edge screens, and even deeper into corners of room that the round screens cannot reach.\\nCompatible Machines - 12\" x 18\" Buffers\\nHow to Attach Sanding Screen to Floor Buffer\\nThe weight of your sanding machine/buffer will keep your screens in place. Some buffer models require attaching your sanding screen in another way, but most round and square buffers can be installed like this:\\nMake sure the machine is off and unplugged - safety first!\\nSet the sandscreen on the floor near the buffer\\nIf your machine requires a buffer pad, lay that on top of the screen\\nTilt the machine back on its wheels\\nLower the machine directly over the screen/pad so the entire base is covered\\nIf your machine doesn’t have wheels, lift it from the base and place it over the screen. Never lift a buffer by its handles, which can damage the buffer.',\n",

No matter if you travel on national or international routes, your favorite books, videos or music become your best companions, especially if you are traveling alone. In this case, you’ll need to convert videos into MP3 files and store it on your device. If you choose this alternative, you don’t have to worry about Internet connection, because you can listen to your songs anytime, anywhere.\\nAs you might have heard by now, the best way to turn a video into an MP3 file is through a YouTube to MP3 converter. The process is not complicated, but first, you have to find the most suitable program. While you’re searching, think about the type of system you are using, because you’ll need different converters for desktop, Android, and iPhone.\\nNext, you will find a step-by-step guide to help you throughout the installment process. Remember that online you can find many such programs available for free download, but each of them has several different specs. When one isn’t working, you can try to use the other. Also, don’t forget another important aspect: YouTube prohibits the download of videos from individual channels, so it’s possible that many dedicated sites won’t work.\\nHow To Use MP3 Converters On Desktop\\nMost of the video converters available online work in a similar way. Now we will present the general manner in which you can perform the process.\\nFirst, you have to open YouTube, search for the video you want to convert and copy its address. The second step is to open the MP3 converter site, paste the video’s address into its page, select the file type (MP3) and click start. Afterward, you can choose to download the converted file.\\nThis is just an example, but you can choose any video converter you consider suitable. Online tutorials will help you find out more and have a better understanding of the converting process, regardless of the program you decide to use.\\nWhat To Do When You Are Converting Videos On iPhones\\nIf you own an iPhone, the first step is to download and store the file on your handset by using Readdle. Before you start converting videos, you’ll have to get the app from the Store, register by entering your Touch or Apple ID password and start using it.\\nAfter this step, you’ll have to open the GenYouTube site, type genyoutube.net in the address bar from the top of the screen and hit the Search button. When you find the video you want to convert, select it and scroll down to the “Download Links” section. The next step will be to tap on one of the MP3 options and GenYouTube will start downloading the MP3 file onto your iPhone. The last step is to tap the Done and Play buttons.\\nHow To Convert YouTube Videos On Android\\nIn case you have an Android phone, the converting process is faster and easier than for iPhones. First, you have to open YouTube, search for a video, select it and tap the Share button. Moving forward, you have to copy the video’s link, open Google Chrome, enter the video’s address, select the Convert button and Download when it’s done converting. In the end, you can listen to the MP3 file by pressing the Play button.\\nIf you are interested in even more technology-related articles and information from us here at Bit Rebels then we have a lot to choose from.',\n",

The MSCC Board of Management still exists under Canon VII, convenes during General Synod, and produces financial statements because of ongoing MSCC legacies and trusts.\\nThe work of the MSCC consisted of domestic and foreign missions. In Canada the work included assisting missionary dioceses, Indian and Eskimo work, Columbia Coast Mission, Church Camp Missions, Jewish Missions, Japanese Missions, Immigration chaplaincies, white settlers missions, and Indian Residential Schools. Foreign missions included church, medical, and education work in Japan, China, India, Palestine (Jerusalem), and Egypt.\\nThe forerunners of the MSCC were the Domestic and Foreign Missionary Society (1883-1902) and the Canadian Church Missionary Society (1894-1903), both of whom were already supporting domestic and foreign missionaries. By the side of the DFMS stood the Woman\\'s Auxiliary (1885-1966), organized in 1885 for the purpose of enlisting the women in the missionary effort of the Church. When the MSCC was formed it became the Woman\\'s Auxiliary to the MSCC.\\nScope and Content\\nFonds consists of constitution, minutes, correspondence, reports, financial records, legal records, printed materials, photographs, and audiovisual materials.\\nFonds organized into the following series:\\nSeries 1.

       " {'text': 'New England IPA\\nFor a few years now, everyone in the craft beer scene has been talking about New England IPAs. These have their roots on the U.S. East Coast and are characterized by their cloudiness (hazyness) and extreme hoppy fruitiness. Responsible for this, in addition to huge amounts of dry-hopped hops, are the New England yeasts used. Compared to a classic IPA, NEIPAs are not that malty, more hopped, fruitier and less bitter.\\nBeer Style Facts: New England IPA / NEIPA\\n- Appearance: Light yellow to orangey yellow. Hazy, cloudy, milky.\\n- Aroma: Insanely fruity. Very juicy. Rather sweet and hardly bitter.\\n- Alcohol: 5-8%. But there are also Double, Triple or Session IPAs in the New England style.\\n- Classic Beer: The Alchemist Heady Topper\\nThe Haze Craze: The short history of the NEIPA\\nA New England IPA is one of the most recent inventions in the craft beer world. It was developed by a brewery from the eastern United States: The Alchemist from Vermont. This brewery is particularly known for the Heady Topper, which led to an absolute hype in the scene in the early 2010s. The beer was massively stuffed with hops, resulting in extreme hoppiness and the most blatant flavors you couldn\\'t taste in any other beer in the world at the time. Founder John Kimmich focused solely on this beer for years, refining it to perfection. His proprietary yeast, created over time, is now known in slight variation as \"Vermont Yeast\".\\nThe differences between American IPA and New England IPA\\nNEIPA, as it is abbreviated among nerds, differs from a regular American IPA or West Coast IPA, particularly in mouthfeel and intensity. In the beer recipe, you\\'ll find a higher percentage of wheat malt, which leaves more protein in the beer than barley malt. It\\'s familiar from a Hefeweizen, which also has a high wheat content. Visually, this is evident by the concise cloudiness. Oats and oat malt can also be used in larger quantities in a NEIPA. Both wheat and oats give the beer a certain creaminess and softness on the tongue.\\nThe yeast is also different than that used in a regular IPA. It is derived from the aforementioned Vermont yeast and barely clarifies the finished beer despite storage. That\\'s why it\\'s often referred to as a \"Hazy IPA.\"\\nThe most noticeable difference, however, is the hop addition. A NEIPA is brewed with a multiple amount of hops. And for the most part, the hops used tend to be added after the wort boil. Optimally, though, in the form of dry hopping in the fermentation or lagering tank. And the cold hopping is done not just once, but at least twice. This is then referred to as double dry-hopping (DDH). The shape of the hops is also different than usual. Cryo Hops, Lupulin Powder or T90 are the special processing forms of hops, which are particularly suitable for the delivery of aromatics, because they are highly concentrated and the important lupulin is optimally bound.\\nHere is an overview of the differences with other IPAs:\\n- higher amount of wheat and oats\\n- different yeast strain\\n- many more hops\\n- special hops\\nHow does a NEIPA taste?\\nA New England IPA hardly makes you think of it as a beer. The haziness and intense aromatics are extremely different from the beer you know. Together with the soft body, one thinks more of a fruit juice than of craft beer. There are no typical hop varieties in a NEIPA, however, the European classic varieties are not used as much as American hops or even hops from New Zealand. These varieties have more blatant fruit characteristics of tropical fruit, citrus, grape, apricot, peach or coconut.\\nJuicy, hazy - here you go!\\nWe\\'ve got some really funky New England IPAs from Germany, Europe and the USA. Pretty much every brewery has at least one NEIPA on tap. Some breweries only brew New England IPAs. Let us inspire you and experience how incredible a NEIPA can taste.\\nJust try the Tasty Juice from Lervig, an absolute top-notch NEIPA.',\n",

       " {'text': 'Improving Awareness of Automated Actions using an Interactive Event Timeline\\nDigital tabletops provide an opportunity for automating complex tasks in collaborative domains involving planning and decision-making, such as strategic simulation in command and control. However, when automation leads to modification of the system’s state, users may fail to understand how or why the state has changed, resulting in lower situation awareness and incorrect or suboptimal decisions. Most of the current digital tabletop applications only focus on providing feedback of current situation rather than historical events.\\nThe aim of this work is to support situation awareness in collaborative systems with automation in tabletop environments, so that groups can perceive changes in the system, comprehend them, predict future events, and, ultimately, make optimal decisions. We investigated the design of an interactive event timeline which enables exploration and analysis of automated system actions in a collaborative environment. We use a collaborative digital tabletop board game to illustrate this design concept.\\nTwo open questions regarding the design of the interactive event timelines relate to who can access the timeline (i.e. timeline placement) and to where the event feedback should be provided when someone interacts with a timeline action block (feedback location). Regarding the place, one timeline can be shared among players or dedicated to each individual. In terms of the feedback location, the event feedback can be placed on the timeline itself, on the game board area, or in both places. Our user study showed that players’ amount of interaction with the timeline was correlated with improved situation awareness. Moreover, displaying feedback both on the game board and timeline was the most preferred. The next step of the study is to conduct further analysis to understand how the players gather situation awareness with different timeline setups.\\n|Digital tabletop version of the board game Pandemic: with individual timelines for each player shown during play (left) and a screenshot of the interface, with the timelines highlighted in red (right).|\\n- Pandemic board game used with permission from Z-Man Games and Matt Leacock\\n- Digital game board art design by Todor Doychev',\n",

Thirty years later, that record still features in the Barnes family Christmas celebrations.\\n“Dad will be embarrassed by this, but when we were kids we recorded a Christmas album as the Tin Lids, 30 years ago this year. My Dad, every Christmas, he’ll put on the Tin Lids Christmas album every year, whether we like it or not,” Mahalia said.\\n“He’ll have a little tear. He gets a bit emotional, he does. This tough rock ‘n’ roller, he’s quite an emotional guy.\\n“So there’s always a bit of Tin Lids playing in the morning while Dad reminisces.”\\nThe Barnes family love Christmas, and music is a big part of that. The family comes together to sing and jam, and enjoy time together.\\n“We’re a big family, there’s a lot of us, we’re a close family. And we love Christmas. It’s such a fantastic time to get together and catch up with the whole family and really show a bit of love and appreciation for the year that’s passed.”\\n“It’s such a fantastic time to get together and catch up with the whole family and really show a bit of love and appreciation for the year that’s passed,” – Mahalia Barnes\\nBut it hasn’t been an easy year in the music industry. Creative industries have been some of the hardest hit by the pandemic.\\n“We rely on large crowds ideally to make what we do work, and to connect with people and play.”\\n“It’s not quite the same without an audience,” Mahalia said.\\n“So with all the border closures and restrictions and social distancing and capacity restrictions it’s been incredibly difficult for the arts. We’re really glad to see that things are starting to open back up and we’re hoping that things will get back to some semblance of normal soon.”\\nMahalia said that in the first lockdown of 2020 she tried to reset, stay positive and enjoy more time with family, but they all missed performing.\\n“I love what I do. And we all love to perform in my family. We tried to find ways to still do that via Instagram and Facebook, we were doing some online performances,” she said.\\n“It was a little strange without having an audience there at all and doing all these performances in front of a computer screen or a phone. But we certainly found that we had a lot of fun doing that and we got such a great response from people online.\\n“Hopefully it brought a smile to some people’s faces like it did for us.”\\nMahalia is positive about the prospects for live local music over the festive season. New research commissioned by Vicinity shows that 95 per cent of Australians say that music positively impacts their lives and most people also want to see more support for the arts.\\n“I think that people are really hungry for entertainment, for music and for that connection to each other,” she said.\\n“Most people really do understand that the arts have been hit hard by the pandemic.”\\n“From our point of view as performers, we’re just super excited to get back out there because we know how much music brings joy to people.\\n“And especially at a time like this, in the lead-up to Christmas, it’s the perfect time to get out and see some live music and support artists and connect with our loved ones and create new memories.”\\nTo find out where Mahalia Barnes is performing this summer, visit mahaliabarnes.com.au.\\nArticle supplied with thanks to Hope Media.\\nAbout the Author: Katrina is a writer, radio presenter, children’s book author, and mother of three.',\n",

You’ve been bombarded with information, so you need to find a reputable source with credible options before you make any decisions on which product would be best for your needs.There are many sources that’ll provide you with that information- buying guides or ratings websites, word-of-mouth testimonials from friends or family members, online forums where users share their personal experiences, product reviews specifically found all over the internet and YouTube channels. Only thorough research will ensure that you get the right product.But that’s not always easy, right? That\\'s why we\\'ve taken time to compile a list of the best Shoe For Hip Pain in today\\'s market, on your behalf, so that there will be no more worries for you.How did we come up with the list, you ask? How did we create this buying guide?\\n- First, our algorithms collected as much information available about these products from trusted sources.\\n- We employed both Artificial Intelligence and large data volume to validate all collected information.\\n- Then our AI ranked them on their quality-to-price ratio using industry-standard criteria that let us pick the best Shoe For Hip Pain currently on the market!\\n- Brand Value: What happens when you go for a not-so-reputable brand just because the price seems cheap? Well, the chance of getting a short-lasting product goes higher. That’s because the renowned brands have a reputation to maintain, others don’t.\\n- Features: You don’t need heaps of features, but useful ones. We look at the features that matter and choose the top Shoe For Hip Pain based on that.\\n- Specifications: Numbers always help you measure the quality of a product in a quantitative way. We try to find products of higher specifications, but with the right balance.\\n- Customer Ratings: The hundreds of customers using the Shoe For Hip Pain before you won’t say wrong, would they? Better ratings mean better service experienced by a good number of people.\\n- Customer Reviews: Like ratings, customer reviews give you actual and trustworthy information, coming from real-world consumers about the Shoe For Hip Pain they used.\\n- Seller Rank: Now, this is interesting! You don’t just need a good Shoe For Hip Pain, you need a product that is trendy and growing in sales. It serves two objectives. Firstly, the growing number of users indicates the product is good. Secondly, the manufacturers will hopefully provide better quality and after-sales service because of that growing number.\\n- Value For The Money: They say you get what you pay for. Cheap isn’t always good. But that doesn’t mean splashing tons of money on a flashy but underserving product is good either.

A robust and durable Shoe For Hip Pain will serve you for months and years to come.\\n- Availability: Products come and go, new products take the place of the old ones.

We try to feature products that are up-to-date and sold by at least one reliable seller, if not several.\\n- Negative Ratings: Yes, we take that into consideration too! When we pick the top rated Shoe For Hip Pain on the market, the products that got mostly negative ratings get filtered and discarded.',\n",

Most of the dolls have been sold, the treasures packed in boxes and the mine closed.\\nOver the decades, the gates remained closed, dust gathered, and most assumed the gemstone mine was long gone.\\nAfter buying the cafe, Mrs. Bubb was eager to reopen the gemstone mine.\\nShe spent days cleaning away years of accumulated dust and revealing the stones to their former glory.\\nMr. and Mrs. Bubb not only admire the stones, but also the couple whose vision brought Fantasy Land to life.\\n“To think that someone had all this time to do this and it went so well.',\n",

       " {'text': '\"People are not grasping the carbon consequences,\" of such huge fires, says an Australian environmental scientist\\nBy Michael Taylor\\nKUALA LUMPUR, Jan 9 (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - Climate-heating emissions from Australia\\'s devastating bushfires are now nearly on a par with those caused by fires in the Amazon rainforest last year, scientists have calculated.\\nAustralia\\'s bushfires, from September to Jan. 6, emitted 370 million tonnes of carbon dioxide, according to the European Union\\'s ECMWF Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS).\\nBy comparison, fires from Brazilian states in the Amazon Basin, which sparked global attention, emitted 392 million tonnes of greenhouse gases from Jan. 1 to Nov. 15 last year.\\n\"People are not grasping the carbon consequences,\" Joe Fontaine, a lecturer in environmental science at Murdoch University in Perth, said of the Australian fires.\\nThe estimate of their carbon emissions \"is sobering and depressing\", he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.\\nSo far 27 people have been killed, thousands made homeless and thousands more evacuated repeatedly as the monster fires have scorched large swathes of Australia, especially in its southeast.\\nWhile media coverage has largely focused on the devastating impacts on people and wildlife, together with air pollution, Prime Minister Scott Morrison has been criticised over apparent attempts to play down the role of climate change in the crisis.\\nMost scientists say the fires have been exacerbated by a nationwide three-year drought they link to climate change.\\nGlobal warming is making extreme events like droughts, heatwaves and bushfires more intense and more likely, said Adam Hodge, a regional information officer with the United Nations Environment Programme in Bangkok.\\n\"Bushfires are normal in Australia as part of the natural cycle, but by some estimates the scale of the current infernos may be the worst on record,\" he said.\\n\" They are a harbinger of things to come. These are the effects we are seeing in a world that has warmed 1.1 degrees (Celsius) above the pre-industrial average,\" he added.\\nAustralia contributes 1.3% of global carbon emissions but is the second-largest emitter per capita behind the United States. Brazil is the seventh-largest emitter of heat-trapping gases.\\nTackling climate change would help prevent catastrophes like the recent fires, Hodge said, adding that \"countries are not doing enough to fight climate change\".\\nMaking comparisons between fire emissions data from Australia and Brazil is complex due to different fire dynamics, such as the type of vegetation and how fires are started, said Mark Parrington, a senior scientist at CAMS in Reading, England.\\n\"A lot of fires across the tropics are started deliberately, often for agriculture,\" he said.\\n\"There have also been fires related to deforestation in Brazil ... whereas in Australia, it\\'s a country that has a (natural) fire habitat, so fire is part of the ecosystem.\"\\nTallying emissions across regions can also politicise the issue and shift the focus to other countries, he said.\\nDespite spikes in areas hit by bushfires, Australia is experiencing an average year for emissions from fires at a national level, a CAMS spokeswoman said, although the last four months of emissions were above average.\\nSince 2010, Australia\\'s average annual fire-related emissions have been 440 million tonnes, with the record being 916 million tonnes in 2011.\\nGlobally, the number of fires and related emissions mostly declined over the last several decades, Parrington noted.\\nFire emissions may also be compensated for by regrowth when the vegetation recovers in burned areas, carbon experts say.\\nAccording to Global Forest Watch, a forest monitoring service, from October to Jan. 8 in Australia\\'s New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia and Victoria, fire alert zones covered about 13.3 million acres (5.4 million hectares).\\nMeanwhile, the size of the area that experienced fires in the Brazilian state of Amazonas throughout 2019 totalled 1.4 million acres (567,000 hectares), it added.\\nFontaine, who researches bushfires and fire management, said Australia needed to invest more in research to strengthen its understanding of fires and what it faces now and in the future.\\nFire risks should be managed better and funding increased to speed up response, including a larger professional firefighting force, alongside help for people to get insurance, he added.\\nFontaine said the 370 million tonnes of carbon emissions from the fires so far equalled about two-thirds of annual emissions for the Australian continent from all sources.\\n\"There were some very spatially extensive fires in the 1970s but ... the carbon intensity of these fires is number one,\" he said.\\n(Reporting by Michael Taylor @MickSTaylor; Editing by Megan Rowling.

       " {'text': 'A recent report by Statistics Canada found that nearly 2.1 million women (14.9%) compared to 1.7 million men (12.5%) aged 15 or older reported having one or more disabilities, mobility issues, that limited them in their daily activities. About half (49.9%) of women with disabilities had disabilities considered to be severe or very severe, as opposed to disabilities that are mild or moderate.\\nAt Share Lawyers, our long term disability lawyers know these statistics are more than just numbers. With more than 35 years of experience, we’ve seen how the lives of many individuals are affected by disability. We have worked with many who have challenges living, working, and moving through the world.\\nPain, Flexibility, & Mobility Most Common in Women\\nDisability symptoms including reduced flexibility, pain, and reduced mobility are most commonly reported amongst women. Chronic pain and mobility issues can make it difficult or impossible for some individuals to work and can cause some to feel socially isolated. Isolation can coincide with mental health issues like depression and anxiety, which also make working a major challenge.\\nWomen with Disabilities More Likely to Live Alone Or Be Single Parents\\nWomen with disabilities are more likely to live alone, therefore, often need outside supports. They are more likely to be single parents - this is no exception for women with disabilities - meaning they are often the sole breadwinner for the household. For those finding they are no longer able to work because of their disability, this makes long term disability benefits all the more essential.\\nWomen More Likely to Need Help with Appointments, Housework, & Heavy Household Chores\\nWomen with disabilities report a higher rate of needing help with heavy household chores, housework, getting to and from appointments, and preparing meals. When a woman with a disability receives the support she needs, she is more likely to participate in everyday activities, and take the time to recover from injuries or illness.\\nAt Share Lawyers, we see clients when they are first denied their LTD benefits and they feel like there is nothing they can do. Getting the resources they need, including time away from work, is essential. We are dedicated to ensuring those individuals are able to access the benefits they need.\\nWomen with Disabilities More Likely To Need Workplace Accommodations\\nWomen with disabilities are less likely to receive workplace accommodations to make it easier or even possible to work. Only 47% of women with mobility disabilities who need accommodations like handrails, ramps, widened doorways, or hallways reported having these accommodations, as opposed to 68.3% of men. All too often individuals with disabilities do not have the resources they need to work.\\nThe realities for women with disabilities, especially those with mobility disabilities, can often be a barrier to their ability to work. At Share Lawyers, we can attest to the fact there are many individuals of all genders who are denied the disability benefits they need, and we’ve dedicated our mission to fight for those in need.\\nIf you have had your claim for long term disability denied in Barrie,contactthe long term disability insurance lawyers at Share Lawyers.

Hey everyone. Today we are taking a look back on the only Star Wars film we haven’t talked about yet, Return of the Jedi.\\nHan Solo (Harrison Ford, Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark, The Age of Adaline) is still in the clutches of the vile Jabba the Hutt. As Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill, TV’s Regular Show, Scooby-Doo! Moon Monster Madness) and company hatch their plan to rescue him, the Empire is slowly working on the creation of a weapon more powerful than the original Death Star. Darth Vader (James Earl Jones, The Lion King, The Angriest Man in Brooklyn) and his master, Emperor Palpatine (Ian McDiarmid, Sleepy Hollow, Dirty Rotten Scoundrels) oversee the final touches on the weapon and a final confrontation is set into motion uniting father and son in an epic battle as the fate of the galaxy hangs in the balance in this final film of the original Star Wars trilogy from director Richard Marquand (Jagged Edge, Eye of the Needle).\\nOriginally titled Revenge of the Jedi (but then later renamed as Jedi do not take revenge), Return of the Jedi is solid conclusion to the original trilogy. By tying up the remaining plot threads very expertly set up in the previous two films, Return of the Jedi makes an argument for being one of the best installments of the series. The performances from our main three stars are great, the confrontation with Palpatine is filled with excitement and dread, and the redemption of Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams, Batman, The Lego Movie) doesn’t feel overtly forced. The creature effects ranging from Yoda to Jabba the Hutt and Salacious Crumb (yeah, look it up) are pretty amazing for the time period.\\nThat being said, a true Star Wars fan knows his faults, and I have few…\\nThe use of cutsie-ing the series with Ewoks seemed like an odd choice. Not really bad, but definitely odd.\\nThe film spends a bit too much time on Endor. Just saying.\\nAnd it contains the one frustration I truly have with the Special Editions (the removal of Yub Nub, I didn’t mind the added scene in its place, but could we not get one freakin’ Yub Nub???)\\nNow, back to the positives. The entirety of the opening act on Tattooine? Amazing! Perhaps the best piece of storytelling in the film!\\nThe sound, effects, and score? Cannot say enough greatness, especially about John Williams and his ability to craft new pieces with every film that add to the mythology and create a richer musical vocabulary. Just incredible.\\nSo, all in all, as I continue on my Star Wars Marathon, I was happy to take a pit stop on Return of the Jedi. The film is often thought of as the weakest of the original trilogy, but I think that is more of a testament to how terrific this series is. Were we not destined to have more films, I would have been more than content at this final chapter (I’m not against more, though, so please continue to deliver, Lucasfilm).\\n-Kyle A.

       " {'text': \"Monday, March 28, 2016\\nFour Hundred Thirty-Eight\\nMarch 27, 2016\\n7.15 Miles in 1:07:33\\nMood: Equal parts nervous and inspired\\nSoundtrack: Hamilton (Original Broadway Cast Recording)\\nThis was a rare and wonderful opportunity to add a new state to the roll call of the Run and Shoot blog. Over the four hundred and thirty-eight posts I have posted about runs in Colorado, Kansas, Washington, South Dakota, Illinois, Arizona, New Mexico, Louisiana, Mississippi, and now I have bagged Iowa!\\nThere was a air of nervous energy to this run. I woke up at 5:30, didn't get on the mean streets of Des Moines until 6:01, and I had to be back to my wife's Aunt and Uncle's house, fully bathed and clean and ready for breakfast with family by 8:00. Add to that time constraint the fact that my phone didn't charge overnight, so as I started out that morning my phone was only at 44% charged as I was running through a city that I am wholly unfamiliar with. If my phone died while I was out running, I'd be stuck with no means to contact anyone in a place that I did not know well.\\nI honestly considered for a moment scrapping the run since I was a little worried that I wouldn't have enough time to get a long run in and I was really worried about my phone's battery. I walked outside the house and then went to turn back in with the notion of potentially grabbing my mobile phone battery charger or maybe just abandoning the idea of running altogether, but the door locked behind me and I couldn't get back in to grab it. Rather than sitting on the front porch until someone else woke up, I threw caution to the wind and decided to get my tenth state under my belt.\\nI found myself considering my route carefully and studying the map well so that just in case my phone did die, I would know how to get back. I also checked my phone more often than I usually do to check on the battery life. It was draining more slowly than I expected, which was a blessing. I also found that due to the low altitude with the accompanying high amounts of oxygen gave my stamina a boost and I was able to just keep on moving without having to stop much at all.\\nDes Moines was a much more interesting setting for a run than Naperville, so kudos to Iowa. I found varied houses, nice trails and streams, hills, and all manner of trees. Most of the run happened during the early hours of morning, so the light wasn't perfect to take pictures for most of the run. Despite seeing some cool stuff, I wasn't getting any blog worthy photos. Then, about six miles into the run, I saw a Stegosaurus in someone's front yard, and I knew immediately what the blog post would be featuring for a photo. Thank God for Iowans with dinosaurs in their yards!\",\n",

The book contains a figure very similar to HCA and depicts this figure as being fit for an asylum.

This is the 6th edition since 1841. This extended version, translated by Julius Reuscher, is even printed by two different publishers in Berlin, namely C.A Wolff and C.H. Schultze. This particular book, which never received a great deal of attention in Denmark, is one of HCA\\'s most popular on the German Market.\\nJenny Lind, the famed Swedish opera singer, arrives in Copenhagen. HCA spends a great deal of time with her until her departure on 22nd October. During the time she is in Copenhagen, HCA\\'s almanac contains almost daily mentions of her. He allows himself to hope, in spite of knowing better. The resulting frustrations cause him to feel \"sick at heart\" (the almanac, 20th October). \"She toasted me as she would her brother\" (the almanac 21st).\\nModels for the painter J.V. Gertner.

His spirits are dampened by the political discussions.\\n19th - 21st November\\nSits for the painter Carl Hartmann for a water painting. Hartman had, incidentally, already made a pencil drawing of HCA on the day after his arrival. Before the end of HCA\\'s stay at Gråsten, Hartmann manages to do 4 more pencil drawings of him, as well as a group portrait (also in pencil), in which HCA is portrayed reading aloud for the Augustenborg ducal family (Christian August, Duke of Augustenborg, Princess Louise Augusta, Prince Frederik, Duchess Louise Sophie, and Princess Amalie; the drawing also shows two unidentified ladies).\\nTravels from Gråsten to Hamburg, where he visits his illustrator, Otto Speckter (whose drawings HCA is very pleased with). Continues on 27th to Oldenburg, where he is a guest of Grand Duke August on several occasions.\\n\"Den lille Pige med Svovlstikkerne\" (The Little Matchstick Girl) (written at Gråsten Castle) is printed in Dansk Folkekalender for 1846 (The Danish Folk Calendar), illustrated by J.Th.

Spends time on several occasions with the brothers Grimm. Discusses fairy-tales in general with Jacob and speaks with Wilhelm about his own. Wilhelm Grimm especially likes \"Grantræet\" (The Fir Tree). Partakes in a royal banquet held by Frederik Wilhelm IV of Prussia. The king is familiar with Only a Fiddler, but not the fairy-tales. However, he does mention that he had asked about HCA whilst in Copenhagen, immediately upon his arrival. HCA is the centre of attention in Berlin\\'s high society - he is aware of this and acts accordingly. Several artists and central figures in Berlin\\'s cultural life have invited people to come and meet HCA, but he does not show up. The sister of the painter Caroline Bardua, Wilhelmine, has made the following entry in her diary:\\n\"By his mere presence, the poet Andersen affects every one in the social circles - from the court and downwards - he is the hero of the day\".\\nIn her diary, Wilhelmine Bardua describes HCA as \"highly talkative and accompanies his talk with lively gesticulating\" and claims that he \"is quite good looking\". HCA\\'s principle reason for coming to Berlin is to be with Jenny Lind, but already before they meet he mentions in his diary on 19th: \"I feel that I do not love her as one may\". By this he meant that he was more able to dream about her than to actually approach her. During the stay, he vacillates between being extremely angry with her, telling himself that he does not love her any more, and fluttering around her.\\nAttends a dinner at Jenny Lind\\'s on New Year Eve. There is a Christmas tree in honour of HCA, who she has repeatedly put in his place, during his stay in Berlin, by calling him \"a child\" and \"a good person\" (the diary, 26th and 31st). They are both frightened when a C note is heard from the piano, which has not been touched. (HCA has a fear of seeing deceased persons and had therefore wished that they should mark their presence with tones). On the 29th December and 2nd January, he sits for an unknown painter.',\n",

       " {'text': '- Offers Georgia (GE): https://quynhonhd.me/go-to/neoritm-georgia-ge/ Price: 75 GEL\\n1. Neoritm fights the 4 main signs of hypertension:\\n- Nervous system exaggeration (stress, insomnia, etc.): As part of the Product formula, magnesium normalizes heart rate, calms your nervous system, and reduces anxiety.\\n- Toxins in the Blood: Calcium cleans the blood vessels of impurities and cholesterol, thus making them stronger.\\n- Varicosity and Thrombosis: Product improves venous circulation, protects blood vessels from clotting, prevents varicose veins.\\n- Excess weight: As part of the Product formula, L-carnitine increases your stamina, gives you energy and helps you lose weight.\\n2. What makes high blood pressure so dangerous?\\n- The consequences of high bloodpressure are more dangerous than the combination of cancer and tuberculosis. 89% of cases of hipertension end in infarction.\\n- The result is blood clots in the blood vessels. High risk of brain hemorrhage and stroke.\\n- Smoking, alcohol, an unbalanced diet, lack of exercise, stress and high cholesterol add to the danger.\\n- Overweight people are three to four times more likely to have high bloodpressure than the general population.\\n- IMPORTANT! High bloodpressure is severe, 1/5 of patients are at risk of death. Start treatment now and regain full health.\\n3. Seven suggestive symptoms:\\n- Edema: Dirty vessels don’t have time to pump liquid. The metabolism of water and salt is disturbed. At night, the feet swell until the socks sink into the ankles leaving dents. Puffy face and bags under the eyes. Fingers do not allow to remove the rings. A bloated stomach speaks of swelling of the internal organs.\\n- Tinnitus: From a thin, barely audible screech to a loud howl and hum that interferes with focus. It is a consequence of the increased tension of the cerebral vessels that exert pressure on the eardrums.\\n- Vertigo: A dizzy head, sudden attacks of vertigo indicate that your vestibular apparatus is starving. Often, the hearing also suffers.\\n- Insomnia: Do you feel sleepy and lethargic as you go to bed without being able to fall asleep? This is due to a lack of blood supply to the pituitary gland which stops producing melatonin, the sleep hormone.\\n- Complete reluctance: Absence of force and willingness. You do not want to do anything. You just want to lie down and eat. This feeling arises because the body goes into energy saving mode. The organs do not receive adequate nutrition in the dirty vessels and, in order not to die, your body seeks to reduce activity as much as possible.\\n- Visual abnormalities: Flies, waves, haze in the eyesight. These are symptoms of ocular vascular insufficiency\\n- Joint pain: Depending on the weather, the joints twist. When you wake up in the morning, you do not feel awake and rested, but a semi-paralyzed disabled person. You have to walk around for a while and knead the hardened joints after sleep. This is due to the fact that the synovial fluid loses its properties, and sticks the joints like a tight mass.\\nDo you have at least one of these signs? The vessels require cleaning and nourishing them.\\n4. Expert opinion\\n- The main fighter against hypertension is green tea and hawthorn (bioflavonoids). They are present in almost all antihypertensive drugs.\\n- But, their concentration on most products is small!\\nThus, you may have to wait for many years to see its effect. I know for sure that the only cure with large amounts of green tea and hawthorn (bioflavonoids) is Neoritm. I have seen his formula and the conclusions of independent experts and respected citizens.\\n- I recommend this supplement to my patients and reprimand them if they start self-medication and take something that “a friend advised”, “read about it online”, “listened to on TV”.\\n- This is wrong! You need to fight hypertension only with safe methods! The ones that are trusted by doctors and that will make your disease go away forever.\\nRobert J. – Ph.D. in Medicine\\n- Dorina, 61 years old, Tirana: I realized that reduced AP leads to ischemic stroke – a stroke – I saw it happen to my older sister. Doctors saved her life but she did not fully recover. When I first encountered this disease for the first time, I was aware of some scams and knew I had to seek vegetative, herbal remedies. My doctor, a very smart woman gave me this product. I am very grateful to her. 4 years have passed and I no longer suffer from hipertension. I am completely healthy and I am not afraid of a heart attack or an attack. Take care of your health!\\n- Linda, 47 years old, Durrës: A few years ago, I received a treatment in the sanatorium of Tirana. Research on a new drug for hypertension was held there. Of course, I was scared. But what else could I do? No other medicine helped me, so I decided to try this. Luckily, I happened to be in the group I took Neoritm, and not the harmless sedative. Two hours later, my bloodpressure returned to normal. Gradually, I started to feel much better! I am very pleased to have participated in the drug test at that time. My AP is always fine now.\\n- Anton, 51 years old, Vlora: I am 51 years old. 3 years ago I was diagnosed with hypertension in our clinic. The signs were murmurs in the heart, & c. I suffered but did nothing about it. 6 months ago, judging by the signs, I went through a small stroke. Then naturally I panicked, but I refused to take the pills they recommended me. Chemicals are harmful and I know this from general knowledge. But I did not know what to do. Luckily, I came across an old friend who introduced me to this product. Now, as you can guess, nothing bothers me. My bloodpressure is normal and I’m as healthy as a horse!',\n",

       " {'text': 'How to Deposit Money in Olymp Trade? (Complete Guide!)\\nOlymp Trade is a powerful platform for amateur and expert investors looking to earn money from the forex trading market.\\nThe platform is highly convenient and works as your one-stop broker for indices, stocks, metals, commodities, currencies, EFTs, and even crypto investments.\\nFrom extensions that can make trading analysis a walk in the park to those that boost the aesthetic value of the site, Olymp Trade has it all to make your trading experience one to remember.\\nAdditionally, Olymp Trade sets itself up to be beginner friendly. With many extensions providing valuable and trustworthy advice, novices can learn on the fly. If you\\'re looking to begin earning a side income through profits generated on Olymp Trade, keep reading to make the most of its benefits.\\nWhat is the Olymp Trade Market?\\nThe Olymp Trade Market is an online shop on the platform where customers can buy various extensions, themes, real time trading insights, expert advice, live news of the trading world, etc., and also view the ones they already have.\\nOlymp Trade is only getting more widespread with Indian investors because of its intuitive and instructive user interface. The flexibility options are numerous, allowing you to personalise the usability aspects to suit your trading style.\\nThe platform provides users access to more than 100 financial instruments on its forum, making it easy for people to train, analyse and trade in the market.\\nFrom live news to analytic strategies, the extensions available on Olymp Trade are sure to help you earn profits that investors are looking to bag home.\\nWhat are Olymp Trade Extensions?\\nOlymp Trade provides beneficial extensions for its users. These extensions are tools or functions that don\\'t come with a basic account.\\nExtensions can vary from helping you with trading strategies, getting help from industry experts, or changing the platform\\'s aesthetic traits, be it for graphs, charts, or statistical reference models.\\nLet us first go through the type of extensions you can get for your Olymp Trade account:\\nThe first few types of extensions are used for trading with minimum effort, without having to study the charts yourself extensively. Expert advice will give you insight into the charts and their movements, preparing you to spot favourable changes in the market conditions and leverage the awareness of such information.\\nReal-time trade recommendations will give you no-nonsense, direct advice on which stock to buy and at what price to sell. This is a top-rated tool for those just starting their forex trading journey. But it is important to note that there is always risk involved, like in any trade. The advice given may not always work out, and this demands calculated opinions that rely on critical and analytical thinking abilities.\\nAny experienced trader will tell you how important keeping a lookout for news while trading is. Live news may affect the market directly, for example, via government policies, regulatory changes, mergers, and a hoard of other market fluctuations. On the other hand, news also affects the charts indirectly, for instance, through the people\\'s fear and greed in response to the happenings around them.\\nExpert and advanced strategy indicators are perfect for those who already have the knowledge of charts and some experience on hand. These strategies need some getting used to. Make sure you read about them thoroughly to understand what the charts indicate.\\nFinally, there are themes such as Purple Haze and Inspire that do a tremendous task at giving your screen a modern, relevant, and focus-based look and feel. They are specifically designed to be soothing and aesthetically pleasing to keep your mind calm and collected. Moreover, not only are they easy on the eyes, but the themes also assist you by highlighting the essential bits of the charts naturally. Such a feature saves you from the risk of missing out on evident indicators while studying charts in a hurry.\\nWith this assortment of worthwhile extensions, you\\'re guaranteed to find many to your liking which transform your forex trading goals into reality.

These are the significant parameters you need to consider before investing in an extension.\\nFurther, ensure that the extension you buy works well for you and your trading ideology\\nHow to Subscribe to Olymp Trade Extensions?\\nSubscribing to Olymp Trade Extensions is a simple process. A detailed list of steps is provided below:\\n- From the \\'Platform\\' page, click on the \\'Market\\' option. It is the second option available in the menu on the left-hand side.\\n- The store that opens will show a list of extensions available with their price, ratings, and minimum duration.\\n- Browse and click on the extension you like. You\\'ll find a detailed explanation of the extension accentuating its benefits. It will also reveal more attributes, such as operating system compatibility (Web, Android, iOS) and compatible modes (FTT, FX).\\n- If you find the extension agreeable, press the blue button with the cost.\\n- Choose the subscription duration from the options of 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months. (Unless the extension is a one-time purchase.)\\nOlymp Trade will then use the required funds for the extension. If you don\\'t have the needed amount, you will be asked to deposit money in your Olymp Trade account.\\nIn India, you can deposit funds using Visa or Mastercard bank cards. Alternatively, you can create a virtual card in the AstroPay system or use foreign e-wallets like Neteller, WebMoney, GlobePay, and Skrill.\\nCan Bonuses Be Used to Pay for Extensions?\\nNo, you aren\\'t able to use bonuses to avail extensions on Olymp Trade.\\nA bonus is the extra capital that Olymp Trade gives you whenever a deposit is made to your account. The amount of compensation depends on the amount of money you deposit.\\nBut in the end, bonus money is merely virtual money that only becomes real when certain conditions are met. As such, bonuses are unfit to be used to buy extensions. Not to forget, they are meant exclusively for trading and increasing your investments while displaying varying risk appetites.\\nOn the other hand, profits and deposits can be utilised readily to buy a subscription.\\nCan I Get Olymp Trade Extensions for Free?\\nYes, it is possible to get Olymp Trade extensions for free. Nonetheless, note that these extensions are not the same as those available in the store. In any case, you can rest assured that they are just as beneficial and will have a positive role to play in your investment decisions.\\nYou need to rake up experience points on Trader\\'s Way to get these extensions.\\nTrader\\'s Way is essentially a customer loyalty program for the traders using the Olymp Trade platform for the long term. It consists of levels that correspond to rewards and higher Olymp trade account statuses.\\nTo level up, you need to earn XP. XP can be acquired by trading in a live account. The more considerable your investment amount, the more experience points you gain. So even if you\\'re making a loss, the silver lining is getting XP points for it.\\nYou can also earn XP by doing daily tasks assigned by Olymp Trade. The tasks often require you to make particular trades. For instance, \"Make 3 trades on EUR/USD in Forex mode\".

To go there, follow these steps:\\nBy default, all extensions are set up to auto-renew, basically indicating the extensions will renew the duration by directly taking funds from your account without asking.\\nWhile this is convenient if you appreciate the extension, it can be concerning if it is not to your preference. Since many traders prefer to be extra protective of every little penny in their forex trading accounts, they may choose to cancel the auto-renew option.\\nIn this case, you have to cancel the subscription manually.\\nHow to Cancel Subscription to an Extension?\\nTo cancel your subscription to an extension:\\nNote: If you\\'re trying to avoid renewal, subscriptions must be cancelled two days before the subscription period ends.\\nHow Much Refund Will I Get?\\nIf the extension you\\'ve subscribed to is for 30-days, there will be no refund no matter how quickly you unsubscribe.\\nIn this case, it is most reasonable to continue using it for the rest of the subscription period.\\nOn the other hand, if the subscription is for 3 months, 6 months, or 1 year, you can apply for a refund.\\nThe amount refunded will depend on your subscription period. Olymp Trade refund policies state that the period is divided into 30-day blocks. That is to say, you\\'ll be refunded for the remaining 30-day blocks. The 30-day time period that has already passed and the one you are currently in are not eligible to be reimbursed.\\nTo illustrate, imagine you had purchased a subscription for 3 months for ₹3000. Regardless, you cancelled in the first month itself. This means you are eligible for the repayment of the 2nd and 3rd 30-day blocks, amounting to a total of ₹2000.\\nHowever, if you cancel even 2 days into the second month, you are only eligible for the 3rd month\\'s ₹1000.\\nHow To Apply for a Refund on an Extension?\\nTo apply for a refund, you\\'ll have to connect with the Olymp Trade customer service. Since the platform functions for users across the globe, forex traders don\\'t have to worry about time zones as assistance is available 24/7.\\nOnce you\\'ve established contact with the customer service, the process is smooth sailing on your end.

Each extension provides an improved trading experience and helps you be in the run for maximised profits.\\nWhether it presents forecasts, advice, analysis tools, or themes, each extension undoubtedly guides you in your venture into trading. As a result, the money you invest in buying these extensions will always bring you sumptuous returns.\\nIf you don\\'t like the extension, cancellation is an uncomplicated process. And on the flip side, if you click with an extension, renewal is effortless since the procedure is automatic.\\nIn conclusion, Olymp Trade is an incredible platform that provides ways for laymen to grasp the specifics of trading and gives you the prospect to make money on your own terms.\\nFact: The platform even provides a demo account to practice for those afraid of diving straight into it.\\nWorry not, they\\'ve also created numerous training videos to assist aspiring traders in their quest to become expert forex investors.\\nWhat are you waiting for?

       " {'text': 'A career in IT security: The path to becoming a CISO\\nby Tina Siering\\nWhat are the tasks of a CISO?\\nThe Chief Information Security Officer, or CISO for short, occupies one of the central positions within an organization. He or she bears overall responsibility for the area of information security. This includes IT security, but also goes far beyond that: the CISO is responsible for the secure handling of information and data in general. There are other security-related positions in companies that sound similar but have a different focus: For example, the CSO (Chief Security Officer) is responsible for the security of the technical and physical infrastructure, while the CIO (Chief Information Manager) looks after information and communications technology within a company.\\nThe Chief Information Security Officer is not organizationally anchored in IT, but usually reports directly to the CEO or the CIO. In his function, the CISO designs an overall strategy for information security within a company. This strategy is based on an individual analysis of all systems and processes. The aim of his or her work is to protect the company\\'s own organization completely and in the best possible way against all potential security risks.\\nIn his day-to-day job, a CISO is responsible for building and regularly monitoring the basic security architecture, protecting against cyber risks, data loss and fraud, and also for identity and access management. In all these areas, he develops security policies that apply company-wide, optimizes processes and organizes training to raise employee awareness of security issues.\\nAs a result of developments in recent years, the position of CISO has continued to grow in importance. On the one hand, this is due to the enormous rise in cyber threats and the increasing dependence on digital systems. On the other hand, the introduction of the European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has also ensured that the topic of IT security must now have an even higher priority. The task of the CISO is to ensure that the company implements and complies with legal requirements such as the DSGVO or the IT Security Act 2.0.\\nWhat are the requirements for the CISO position?\\nAnyone who wants to work as a CISO must have a wide range of knowledge and skills: A CISO needs extensive knowledge in the field of IT and understanding of how networking works. Some examples of this are the function of a VPN, the routing of information or how a DNS works.\\nEqually important is in-depth knowledge of IT security. This is one of the key areas for the CISO. The CISO must find the right solutions to effectively protect their organization\\'s networks and digital systems from the dangers posed by cybercrime - and to do this, they must be familiar with the options and modes of operation of established protection measures such as antivirus software, firewalls and endpoint protection. It is also important to have knowledge of the different types of cyber threats in order to successfully defend against DDoS attacks, phishing, email fraud or other social engineering techniques.\\nThe CISO should also have know-how in the compliance area in order to be able to comply with regulatory requirements. Depending on the industry and core business, this may include the German Data Protection Regulation (DSGVO), IT-Grundschutz, KRITIS or PCI requirements. The CISO is the person in the company who is responsible for the implementation of and compliance with these legal requirements.\\nManagement skills are another skill a CISO needs. The CISO analyzes and plans solutions and concepts for IT security in the company largely independently. He or she coordinates the implementation and realization of measures within this framework. Without organizational talent, it is difficult to maintain an overview and orchestrate the overall construct.\\nDealing with people also plays a role for the CISO. In his position, direct contact with many people in the company is required. This relates, for example, to the implementation of IT security rules or even information events on the subject.\\nMany companies affected by IT security incidents\\nThe survey also shows that around a third of German companies experienced IT security incidents in 2021 that caused damage. Within the affected companies, ransomware leads the pack with a share of 21 percent. Hacking of websites and data theft follow in equal second and third place with 18 percent. The figures make it clear that every company in Germany can be the target of a cyberattack, and that enormous damage can be caused by ransomware.\\nNot only large corporations are affected, but increasingly small and medium-sized companies as well. There are clear reasons for this, such as the still widespread misconception that one is not a worthwhile victim of targeted cyberattacks. Ransomware and the associated extortion have made every company a potentially interesting target. On the other hand, cybercriminals are primarily looking for easy targets. SMEs often have a limited budget when it comes to IT and IT security in particular. Accordingly, it is easier to penetrate the networks of these smaller companies.\\nThe path to becoming a CISO - training, studies and advanced training courses\\nAs with many new careers in IT, there is no clearly defined training path for the CISO. Nevertheless, it is of course possible to focus one\\'s own training on the goal of becoming a CISO. In many cases, the basis is a university degree. A bachelor\\'s degree in computer science or a similar course of study opens the door to the IT security industry. Increasingly, there are also master\\'s degrees with a focus on IT security.\\nAs a fresh graduate, however, it is not directly possible to start as a CISO. This responsible position requires broad specialist knowledge and, above all, professional experience. For this reason, most companies looking for a CISO pay particular attention to the previous stages in the applicant\\'s resume. Practical experience of between seven and twelve years is often required, at least five of which must have been in a position with management responsibility.\\nApplicants can prove their skills and knowledge in the field of IT security via certifications. In our blog post \"The world\\'s top 10 cybersecurity certifications\", we explain which international certificates and training courses are internationally recognized. In addition, there are some German and European certifications that are helpful for a career in IT security. First and foremost, these include certificate courses that teach BSI IT-Grundschutz and ISO/IEC 27001/27002. ISO 27001 is one of the basic requirements for organizing IT systems according to currently valid security standards. Anyone who wants to hold the responsible position of CISO must be confident in dealing with ISO 27001.\\nSome IT service providers also offer specific training courses that, if successfully completed, award a certificate as CISO. Here, care must be taken to ensure that the provider is reputable. The content that such courses impart is definitely helpful and gives a good picture of the tasks that a CISO has.\\nThe salary of a CISO\\nThe position of Chief Information Security Officer entails a great deal of responsibility and is generally well remunerated. According to the well-known job exchanges, the average salary as a CISO is around 100,000 euros per year. However, the salary range is very broad. The individual salary depends primarily on the size of the organization. Larger networks are more demanding and require more expertise.\\nStarting salaries in smaller companies often range between 50,000 and 65,000 euros. However, there are also many job offers where the annual salary is in a range between 125,000 and 175,000 euros. Top salaries then even range beyond 200,000 euros per year.\\nConclusion on the career as CISO\\nThe Chief Information Security Officer is the most important person within a company when it comes to IT security. A position with such great responsibility requires a lot of experience, expertise and special skills. Accordingly, the road is long. But with focus and thoughtful career planning in the area of IT security, it is possible to work toward the CISO in a targeted manner. In any case, it is helpful to take the initiative to acquire the necessary expertise through further training and to prove this with the appropriate certifications.',\n",

In that motion, she wrote: “Four border patrol officers would like to testify at the August 27, 2014 hearing in this case.” She further wrote: “All of the above is true and correct to the best of my knowledge and informed consent (sic).”\\n- Judge Hanen granted the motion, noting: “It is represented to the Court that none of the individuals for whom Plaintiff is seeking subpoenas is objecting to the limitation found in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 45(c)(1) (providing that a subpoena may command a non-party to attend a hearing only within 100 miles of where the person resides….).”\\n- One of the 4 named officers, Ronald Zermeno, begs to differ in an affidavit filed in Court today: “Prior to receiving this e-mail [from a Border Patrol union representative on August 25th with a copy of the subpoena attached] I had no interaction with Orly Taitz, whom I understand to be the plaintiff in the present case.” … “I live in Lake Elsinore, California which is more than 100 miles away…” “I never waived the application of Rule 45(c)(1), particularly since I have had no discussions or interactions with Dr. Taitz.” “It is my personal wish not to testify at the hearing….”\\nThat seems to be pretty serious to me.

       " {'text': 'There are 6 reasons that can make your sweat smell like cheese. The odor of the sweat sometimes mixes with the deodorant and the smell can be acceptable. But sometimes the sprays and perfumes cannot help in hiding the odor of the sweat. Then the smell of the sweat becomes so unfavorable. The odor of sweat becomes unpleasant and it can cause embarrassment.\\nWhy does my sweat smell like cheese?

It is recommended to maintain proper hygiene to prevent cheese like sweat.\\nWhen the person feels the odor of the sweat then a feeling of unpleasant environment generates. Due to this odor, people avoid coming closer to that person. The smell of the sweat sometimes feels like cheese.\\nWhy does my sweat smell like cheese?\\nIn this article, we have explained everything you need to know if your sweat smell like cheese. This cheesy smell can be produced due to many reasons. But this cheesy smell mostly develops in the sweat when there is the development of the sulfur in the body.\\nThe smell of the sweat becomes the same as the cheese smells when it is wet or dry.\\nRelease of sulfur and fatty acids\\nThe whole-body of a person sweats when there are extreme workouts and exercise conditions. In these conditions, the body sweats a lot. During this sweating process, sweat accumulates on the human body.\\nSome organs of the body have the capacity and tendency to store the sweat. The armpits are those areas of the body which have the power to store the sweat in them. This accumulated sweat produces a certain type of odor. The odor of this type of accumulated sweat in unpleasant.\\nNo one can smell this kind of odor for a longer period. These armpits have the development of the sulfur. The minerals of the sweat and body reaction help in the production of body sulfur. When this sulfur gets combined with the bacteria which are already present on the human body and especially in the armpits.\\nThen this combination develops a special odor. This odor of the sweat does not smell like the same odor of the normal sweat. But the smell of the sweat becomes cheese like due to this combination of sulfur and other bacteria that are present on the human body.\\nEspecially the organs which have places to store the sweat in them these organs of the body can produce the smell like cheese in the sweat. The sulfur and bacteria produce some other chemicals in the body sweat.\\nThis chemical is known as a thiol. The smell appears in the sweat. Mostly men sweat smells like cheese. Men have the tendency that has the power to generate some fatty acids in the human body. Due to these fatty acids gives a cheesy smell to the sweat of the human body.\\nThis cheesy smell produces mostly in the armpits of the men’s body.

You should maintain good hygiene, you can use natural methods to treat infected wounds and get rid of bacteria.\\nMoreover when a person tries to hide this through the help of body spray and perfumes. This cheesy smell does not fade easily. The smell is not the same as the cheese but the sense of odor is the same as the cheese. The bacteria of the body are involved in this kind of sweat production which ultimately leads to this kind of cheesy smell.\\nSweat due to emotional disturbance\\nMostly the people suffer from excessive sweating due to exercise of hard work which they do through the human body efforts. But sometimes the people sweat a lot due to emotional disturbance and emotional variation.\\nThis sweat appears on the body due to the emotional disturbance. The hormones vary according to the emotions. The brains move and work according to the emotions of the human body. This can also cause itching in your old stretch marks.\\nThis type of sweat appears in much quantity. But this sweat takes more time to appear as compared to that sweat which may appear due to exercise. This sweat remains for a longer period in the armpits, under the knees, and in the scalp.\\nEven the sweat starts drying in the same places. That is why the sweat starts producing a smell like the cheese. This cheesy smell is due to the sweat glands which produces sweat during the process of sweat production.\\nThe presence of cheese ripens bacteria\\nSome bacteria are used in the food industries. These bacteria are used for the ripening of the cheese. This is a technique that you can match or compare to the cultured technique. Through this technique, the bacteria might help the food industries in ripping the cheese. The bacteria react with the milk. Eventually, the milk converted into cheese.\\nThe food industries are using these bacteria for the development of cheese in bulk quantity. These bacteria are present in the body of a person as well. Yes, the same bacteria which can ripen the cheese are present on the human body as well.\\nThese bacteria are several in numbers. The name of the bacteria which helps in the ripening of the cheese is known as musters some of the bacteria are known as Limburger. These bacteria when are present on the skin these bacteria can eat the dead cells of the body.\\nThe bacteria use the skin of the human body as their host. These bacteria live on the surface of the skin. The eating if the dead skin cells are not only the sole process that is performed by these bacteria. The bacterium is known as Brevibacteria.\\nThese bacteria live on the human body. The bacterium uses the skin as a host. The bacteria digest off the dead cells of the human body and then a cheesy smell appears in the sweat. The sweat produces in the human body by this process as well.\\nThe bacteria which lies on the surface of the skin. By eating dead cells and producing the sweat on the human body. The cheesy smell might appear in the sweat. This phenomenon is also associated with the production of cheesy smell in the sweat of a person. This smell is unpleasant.\\nSkin munching bacteria\\nThere are a lot of factors that are involved in producing the cheesy smell in the sweat of the human body. One of the munching bacteria which can produce the cheesy smell in the sweat is present on the human body.\\nThe bacteria are known as staphylococcus epidermis. This bacterium is involved in producing a cheesy smell of the sweat. Although the whole process of producing the smell is critical. The staphylococcus epidermis is a bacterium the smell in the sweat which is not only cheesy but it is like vinegar as well. This vinegar-like smell is due to isovaleric acid. The acid mixes with sweat and the smell of the sweat appear as the cheesy smell of the sweat.\\nThere is another ingredient that is involved in converting the sweet into a liquid that has a cheese-like smell. This ingredient is known as a propionic bacterium. These bacteria may cause the cheesy smell in the sweat. This can cause red bumps to appear after shaving the bikini area.\\nThe smell of the sweat can be converted into a cheesy smell of propionic acid. All of these acids have the cheesy smell but the acids vary the smell into different feelings. Some cheesy smells are different from the other smells due to different acids.\\nThese smell in the sweat of the human body in unpleasant. The smell sometimes becomes unbearable. It becomes really difficult for the person who is suffering from this kind of sweat and smell.\\nThere are sweat glands in the human body that can produce sweat in the human body. These glands are of various types. The glands have their names and functions accordingly. The sweat glands are named as apocrine and eccrine glands.\\nThese glands can produce sweat in the human body. The Bromohidrosis is a condition in which the sweat can be of cheesy smell. These glands can produce sweat in bulk quantity in the body.\\nMoreover, the cheesy smell appears in the sweat even after bathing for more than thirty minutes. The bathing which is continued for more than thirty minutes cannot be able to stop the sweating and cheesy smell.\\nThe cheesy sweat appears in the armpit and other areas of the body. These organs are those parts of the human body like beneath the knees. With these conditions, the doctor can identify that either the person is suffering from bromhidrosis. In such conditions, the sweat produces the smell of cheese.\\nThis cheesy smell is unpleasant. Mostly is developed by these glands. Glands play a vital role in the production of sweat.\\nBromhidrosis is divided into two types. One type is apocrine bromhidrosis is one of the most common types of this condition. In such cases, if the body sweat produces an odor. The odor which appears in the sweat is cheesy.\\nThe odor is the combination of two things. Some lipids are present in and on the human body. These lipid-rich apocrine which are the sweat glands. These glands mix the lipids and the bacteria on the skin. When the combination of lipids and skin bacteria takes place. The sweat carries a certain kind of odor which is cheesy and vinegary in the smell.\\nThe lips and skin bacteria not only produces the odor in the sweat directly. But the combination produces the Thioalcohols. These alcohols produce the sulfur. Sulfur can produce the cheesy in the sweat especially in the armpit area and those areas which can store the sweat beneath the surface.\\nThe second type of bromhidrosis is when the combination of keratin and eccrine glands occurs. The eccrine glands can produce sweat and keratin is present on the surface of the skin.\\nThe sweat softens the keratin which is present on the surface of the skin. When the keratin becomes soft. It becomes really easy for the bacteria to not only breakdown the surface but also penetrate inside.\\nThe breakdown process plays a vital role in the development of the odor in the sweat. The odor is stretchy in the feeling. The sweat can be produced in those areas of the skin that can store the sweat. Both of these types of bromhidrosis can cause the development of the cheesy odor in the sweat.',\n",

Another factor that has come up when talking about testosterone supplementation is how much people think that testosterone is a substitute for what they need when suffering from male pattern baldness, or other menopause-related conditions such as PMS and menopause-related conditions. As you can see, testosterone is far more than that for some men, muscle building anabolic steroid cycle. So there is a lot of truth to this whole testosterone supplement idea. It is safe and there are some health benefits to testosterone supplementation, muscle building steroids.

And that is definitely an issue we need to examine, muscle building steroids for sale in south africa. If you can\\'t find it on a product label, there is no excuse for you not to take it. Just because someone puts it on their label doesn\\'t mean that they mean what they say on their product label. And if it is a product that contains testosterone, then don\\'t take it unless you are 100% sure that you want to consume it. Or as noted previously for anabolic steroids: DIAGNOSE OF TESTOSTERONE — A TESTERONE IMPLANT There are many products on the market today that contain testosterone, commonly referred to as Testosterone-like substance (TOX), muscle building safe steroids. As a precautionary measure, it is recommended that you use one which has been approved by the U, effects side anabolic steroids stopping.S, effects side anabolic steroids stopping. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for a specific use before initiating use of any product and taking it for at least one year prior to testing positive. Testosterone-like substances have been found for sale on most sporting goods websites for years while in some cases even before FDA approval is granted. It has become a common problem to find and purchase testosterone-like drugs online where the product is given the label, \"T-L-Test\" or \"TOX TEST. The FDA has not approved the labeling for these products and has issued warnings against using any of these products in human health applications.\\nIllegal steroids or anabolic androgenic steroids are synthetic and are manufactured edition of the male sex hormone testosterone. \"They can have effects similar to those of the more traditional compounds and are often referred to as \\'roids\\' or \\'synthetic testosterone.\\'\" They work by blocking a specific protein called P450 1A2 which causes the body\\'s production of testosterone. This is when anabolic steroids become dangerous, as they can increase an athlete\\'s power output. \"Anabolic agents can suppress an athlete\\'s natural hormone production, which may lead to anabolic symptoms or signs such as low testosterone, high cholesterol, and weight gain.\" - http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/nation/article10366462.ece Examples include: Trenbolone (reforms) Cyproterone acetate (reforms) Human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) Diazapride (reforms) Human erythropoietin (EPO).

The most common type of testosterone is known as Testosterone ester and can be given to be used in a number of ways. It is commonly used in the treatment of male pattern (male pattern balding, hair loss, acne, etc.) androgenic hair growth. The most potent in this hormone is called Testosterone cypionate. It is a fast acting muscle building drug and is best utilized during the steroid cycle. Testosterone is mainly used for its effects on muscle tissue, muscle growth, and it plays a major role in testosterone-induced muscle growth. It can increase muscle mass, increase muscle strength, decrease body fat, improve blood flow, improve skin elasticity, decrease inflammation, and increase the production of growth hormone.

Perhaps we should have kept our proverbial mouths shut, because it didn’t take long for Mother Nature to test us on our claim of always being ready.\\n2022 didn’t come in like a lion, it came in like a 3-headed monster. During the first week of the year we saw sustained winds of nearly 40 miles per hour, with gusts up to 60 mph. And that was on top of snow that was measured in feet, not inches, in some of our higher elevations, not to mention the single-digit temperatures. And after that, everybody’s favorite weather event…freezing rain. All of this added up to localized outages from Stateline to Starbuck, and several points in between. Snow-covered tree limbs fell on power lines and ice-covered roads sent vehicles into power poles.\\nBut our crews responded. We were ready, and we couldn’t be prouder of the way our team rose to this challenge.

       " {'text': 'Dropping Coin: The Kansas City Chiefs Spending Spree and It’s Fantasy Impact\\nBy Tommy Harvey\\nThe Kansas City Chiefs have paid some serious dough over the last 10 days to franchise QB Patrick Mahomes and DT Chris Jones. The Super Bowl champs made Mahomes the first $500 million man and then turned around and signed Jones to a 4-year $80 million deal with $60 million of that functionally guaranteed.\\nThe 2020 NFL salary cap is set at $198.2 million, which is up from $188.2 million in 2019. Since 2013, the cap has steadily risen from $123 million, however the current climate may dictate where that rises (or falls) to in 2021. With so much uncertainty, how do teams forecast player contracts? It doesn’t seem like the Chiefs are too worried at the moment.\\nOn July 6, the Madden 20 cover boy’s record setting deal was announced. With a max value of $502,631,905, Mahomes has inked the richest deal in professional sports history. The 10 year extension will have the 24 year old linked to Kansas City until 2031.\\nHere’s a breakdown:\\nIn my opinion, Patrick Mahomes is one of a handful of players in the NFL who is worth whatever his organization wants to pay him. Chiefs fans pay to go to Arrowhead Stadium to see what incredibleness he has up his sleeve. The better he performs, and consequently, the better the team performs, the more merchandise fans buy and the more money the franchise makes.\\nJones, 26, was on the franchise tag designation for the 2020 season, but had threatened to sit out without a resolution on a new deal. With Wednesday’s extension deadline looming, the Chiefs struck a deal with the Pro Bowl DT. Worth up to $80 million, the new contract locks up Jones for four more seasons.\\nThe champs now have their core all signed through the 2021 season, allowing them to attempt to build the next NFL dynasty. In 2021, Travis Kelce and Tyrann Mathieu become unrestricted free agents. Tyreek Hill’s deal runs through 2022 before he becomes a free agent. What happens then? Who will be cap casualties when the core players have to be paid...or demand to be paid?\\nSammy Watkins - Watkins is an unrestricted free agent after the 2020 season. The WR is set to make $9 million and could be allowed to walk afterwards. The 27 year old has played a full 16 games in a season only once...his rookie season of 2014. He has also only tallied 60 receptions and over 1,000 yards in a season once...2015.\\nThe question has to be asked...and rightfully so...is the oft injured receiver worth paying $9+ million a year? With guys like Mecole Hardman and Demarcus Robinson around, Watkins’ time in Kansas City could be coming to an end.\\nTyreek Hill - Hill is going to get a massive deal when his contract expires after the 2022 season. The question is...will that deal come from the Chiefs? Could they afford his services? His numerous legal issues have been a concern, and a deal would likely be contingent on him staying out of trouble moving forward.\\nThere is no doubting his on-the-field contributions. He is one of the best WR in the NFL and his speed is second to none. The 26 year old Pro Bowler has put up multiple seasons of 75+ catches and 1,100+ yards, and is widely considered a top-5 dynasty WR. Would he still be considered that if he moved on to a different offense?\\nMecole Hardman - The 2nd year WR could be a major beneficiary if fellow pass catcher Sammy Watkins moves on after his contract expires. In a dynasty league, I would set my sights on Hardman as a trade target. If he becomes the WR2 in Kansas City after 2020, he could be a major steal.\\nIn 2019, Hardman was drafted by the Chiefs in the 2nd round. What that tells me is that they have major plans for him and expect him to be a big part of their future offense. When Tyreek Hill’s contract runs up after 2022, he could be in line to become the WR1 if Hill moves on.\\nDamien Williams - Signed as an undrafted free agent by the Miami Dolphins in 2014, Williams signed with KC in 2018 and became a dynamic part of their offense after Kareem Hunt was released. In 2019, he was a key component in the Chiefs Super Bowl comeback victory over the San Francisco 49ers.\\nThe Chiefs drafted Clyde Edwards-Helaire in the 1st round of the 2020 NFL Draft, seemingly spelling doom for Damien Williams fantasy owners. Williams’ current contract is up after this season, and could be another player forced to find employment elsewhere.\\nTravis Kelce - Kelce is a future Hall of Famer. He has had over 1,000 yards the last four consecutive seasons, and has had at least 862 yards every season since he took over as the starting TE for the Chiefs. His current deal is set to expire after ther 2021 season and he will be 31 years old.\\nWith Kelce getting older, will the Chiefs try to re-sign him to a big deal? With Tyreek Hill’s deal expiring in 2022, will they look to pay him instead?\\nSo many variables will end up contributing to who stays in Kansas City and who ultimately will leave. One thing is for sure though, the Chiefs will have at least a couple more seasons of high octane offense as they look to repeat as Super Bowl champs.\\nFollow me on Twitter @dynastyprostom',\n",

       " {'text': 'Main Article Content\\ncystic fibrosis, multi-resistant bacterial infection, lactic acidosis, mitochondria, chloramphenicol\\nChildren with cystic fibrosis are commonly colonized with multi-resistant bacteria. In such patients, infectious exacerbation may require salvage therapy with uncommonly used antimicrobials, including chloramphenicol. Chloramphenicol is rarely used nowadays because of the associated severe adverse events. We describe the case of a 15-year-old female with terminal cystic fibrosis who required intravenous (IV) chloramphenicol treatment for a Burkholderia cepacia ( B. cepacia ) exacerbation. The child subsequently developed lactic acidosis and secondary respiratory compensation adding to her baseline respiratory distress. Based on the Naranjo scale, the probability of chloramphenicol being the cause of the hyperlactatemia and associated respiratory distress was rated as probable, as the adverse effects resolved upon discontinuation of the drug. Subsequent genotyping for mitochondrial polymorphism (G3010A) confirmed a possible susceptibility to lactic acidosis from mitochondrial RNA-inhibiting agents such as chloramphenicol. Hyperlac - tatemia is a rare but life threatening adverse effect that has been previously reported with chloramphenicol exposure, but is not generally thought of. Clinicians should be aware of this potentially life threatening, but reversible adverse event. Lactate should be monitored under chloramphenicol and it should be discontinued as soon as this complication is suspected, especially in patients with low respiratory reserve.\\n2.

The Sabres lost in 1975 to the Flyers and ’99 to Dallas, while the Canucks fell in 1982 to the Islanders, ’94 to the Rangers and 2011 to the Bruins. Only the 2011 Canucks were within one win of the Cup, but they lost twice to the Bruins, game six in Boston and game seven in Vancouver, the latter sparking disgusting riots throughout British Columbia.\\nThe other team on the clock is the Maple Leafs.\\nToronto has won 13 Cups, second to Montreal’s 24, but the Leafs haven’t hoisted the 16-kilogram (35-pound) silver trophy since 1967, the last year of the “Original Six”. The Maple Leafs haven’t even reached the finals since 1967, losing in the semifinals on numerous occasions.\\nThe Leafs’ futility is a running joke in the NHL, especially in Montreal, Boston, Ottawa and Buffalo, four cities which would root for a team captained by Donald Trump over the Leafs. Toronto hasn’t won a Cup since Lester Pearson was Canada’s Prime Minister, yet the Leafs are the NHL’s most valuable franchise, have some of the highest, if not the highest, ticket prices in North American professional sports, and have a season ticket waiting list rivaled by only the Packers and Redskins.\\nToronto isn’t going to win a Cup until it gets rid of Mitch Marner and/or William Nylander for help on the blue line and a competent backup goaltender.\\nThe Leafs’ defense is putrid. It stinks. Yet the Leafs went out and threw a crapload of money at John Tavares last year. Tavares is great, but how many scorers does a team need? This isn’t 1984 when the Oilers were winning games 10-3 and 12-5 on many nights. It isn’t 1998 when 1-0 games were as common as a cold, but the days of teams scoring 400 goals a year are long gone.\\nFredrik Andersen isn’t that good to begin with, and he certainly can’t carry a team on his shoulders the way Patrick Roy, Martin Broedeur and Grant Fuht could in their heyday. The Leafs haven’t had one since Terry Sawchuk.\\nI can’t see Toronto doing a damn thing until the two things I mentioned above happened. Until then, it will be one and done in the playoffs for the next couple of years.\\nVancouver and Buffalo? Please. They’re even more hopeless than the Leafs. If either makes the playoffs before 2022, I will be truly surprised.\\nBoston’s window may have slammed shut. Tukka Rask, Patrice Bergeron, Brad Marchand and Zdeno Chara are near the end of the line.\\nAs long as Tampa Bay, Nashville, Carolina, Florida, Arizona, Vegas, Dallas and Anaheim don’t get their grubby paws on the Cup, it won’t be too bad.\\nThe NHL needs to seriously realign when Seattle comes on board. The NFL model of eight divisions of four might work. This would be my setup:\\n–Seattle, Vancouver, San Jose, Colorado\\n–Anaheim, Arizona, Los Angeles, Vegas\\n—Calgary, Edmonton, Winnipeg, Minnesota\\n–Chicago, St. Louis, Dallas, Detroit\\n–Nashville, Carolina, Tampa Bay, Florida\\n–Washington, Philadelphia, Rangers, Islanders\\n–Buffalo, Pittsburgh, Columbus, New Jersey\\n–Boston, Montreal, Ottawa, Toronto\\nDividing the three New York City teams seems like blasphemy, but the Devils haven’t been in New York as long as the other two. And the Devils make more sense in a division with three other American teams. Toronto makes sense with Boston and Montreal, since the three have been rivals since the beginning of the NHL.\\nDetroit and Chicago should be in the same division. It’s silly they aren’t. I understand the Red Wings’ fear of playing more west coast games, but why they aren’t playing their oldest rival more often is silly.\\nThe Flames and Oilers have been begging for more games vs. the Jets. The two Alberta teams would love Vancouver in their division, but the Canucks and the new team in Seattle not together doesn’t make sense. The only other way to slice it would be to put Seattle in with the Canucks, Flames and Oilers, then move a few other pieces around on the board.\\nThe four southernmost teams deserve one another. Washington needs to be in a division with northeastern teams, not ones far south of the Mason-Dixon Line.\\nIf the NHL wants four divisions of eight, here’s what I’d like to see:\\n–Vancouver, Seattle, Calgary, Edmonton, Winnipeg, Colorado, Minnesota, St. Louis\\n–San Jose, Los Angeles, Anaheim, Arizona, Vegas, Dallas, Nashville, Columbus\\n–Chicago, Detroit, Pittsburgh, Buffalo, Florida, Tampa Bay, Carolina, Washington\\n–Boston, Montreal, Ottawa, Toronto, Philadelphia, New Jersey, Islanders, Rangers\\nThat’s enough hockey for now.',\n",

       " {'text': 'Fakahatchee Grass (tripsacum dactyloides), alternately also referred to as Eastern Gamagrass, is an extremely popular Florida native ornamental grass. This grass is evergreen in sub-tropical areas and has bright green blades with a serrated edge. They grow in rounded clumps reaching 5-6 feet in height and 4-6 feet wide in Florida. There is also a Dwarf Fakahatchee Grass (Tripsacum floridanum) which can reach heights of around three feet.\\nFakahatchee Grass can complement the home landscape in a variety of situations to soften harsh areas under tall palm trees, or as background for shrubs and even in a pot. This ornamental grass can also be found growing along pond banks, swamps and other wet sites throughout Florida.\\nFakahatchee Grass Plant Characteristics\\nFakahatchee Grass does well in sun and light shade and does well in dry to partially wet soil. It can tolerate standing water if it drains relatively quickly. It has a medium salt tolerance, which makes it ideal for the Florida environment. Its preferred soil pH range is between 5.1-7.5. The planting season for stratified seed is spring and winter for non-stratified seeds. The dense and bunching growth pattern of this grass provides coverage for small wildlife.\\nGrowing And Maintenance Tips For Fakahatchee Grass\\nThis plant is available in local nurseries and can easily be propagated by seeds and division. To establish Fakahatchee Grass, plant into a well prepared and clean tilled weed-free seed bed. It grows easily when planted in full sun or light shade.\\nPlant spacing for your new plantings is important to allow enough room for growth. Space grasses as far apart so that they can become tall. Provide at least an inch of water every week, until the plant is well established.\\nIn early summer, the stems flower to produce a crop of jointed seeds. The lush growth leads to large clumps that die out in the center, so occasionally cutting back to the ground or division is necessary. And for propagation consider dividing grasses every three or four years in spring, just as they are beginning to break dormancy. You can dig the plant up and cut the clump into divisions with a knife or spade and replant the new divisions as a container grown plant. This will help the grasses root and renew.\\nFakahatchee Grass is easy to grow, maintain and propagate. You can create a landscape of rich green foliage in your back yard with this ornamental grass. Sit back and watch as the clumps of Fakahatchee Grass in your garden sways in the light breeze. It is a larval plant for checker skipper butterfly and songbird will use the segmented seeds as a food source.\\nTo try out this great beginner plant, visit our nursery at Wilcox Nursery And Landscape in Largo, FL 33774.

       " {'text': 'PUBLISHED ON August 29, 2021\\nDoes your lower back hurt? Are your movements restricted due to excruciating pain, and do you wonder how often you need to refill your pillbox? If yes, then I will demand your undivided attention till the end. Let’s talk about how to mitigate that debilitating pain without messing your system with unnumbered prescription meds and their complicated chemical compounds.\\nWhat Is Sciatica?\\nContrary to popular misconception, not every lower back pain, no matter how paralyzing it may feel, is sciatic pain. The sciatic nerve that stretches through the back of both of your legs starts from your lower back and crosses the buttock muscles. The sciatic nerve helps you with sensation to not just the legs but also the soles. The pain associated with this very specific, overused, and mismanaged nerve is precisely sciatic pain.\\nWhat Causes Sciatic Pain?\\nThe most targeted populace to suffer from sciatic pain is usually between the age of 30-50, primarily because of our modern lifestyle that includes prolonged sitting in front of a device. However, several other common causes of sciatic pain include sneezing, coughing, physical activity like lifting weights without proper techniques, or any sudden movement.\\nWhat Are The Symptoms Of Sciatica?\\nIn sciatic pain, the symptom does not stop at back pain due to our very complex and intertwined nervous system. It very well includes numbness, dull aches, tingling, and sometimes inflammation sensation. The distinctive feature of sciatic pain is that it is felt mostly on one side of your body.\\nWhy Chiropractor Over Medicine For Sciatica?\\nThough curing any medical condition has a very clear goal to end the suffering at the earliest and provide you with comfort, it is very important we follow a practical process that does not just work on the symptoms but also on the root cause of the problem. More often than not, the modern medicine you have been taking will only mask the symptoms, leaving the root cause to sprout any time in the future. A chiropractor in Brampton will make all the difference here.\\nHow Chiropractors Will Lead You To Cure?\\nSciatica is an issue that may not be cured completely, but a chiropractor will make sure you are at least at risk while performing all of your daily routines through a drug-free, non-invasive procedure. Something as sensitive and irreplaceable as your spine needs the least possible toxicity (read muscle relaxants and pain relief meds!), and keeping your inside clean while making some small yet impactful changes in your daily life holds the key to this cure.\\nA chiropractor will guide you to maintain the right posture, will educate you on ways to avoid prolonged sitting without hindering your relationship with your device, and will help you maintain a healthy weight with a positive attitude. To add to the mitigation process, they often advise you to exercise regularly, but if this includes you lifting weights improperly, then stop and focus again. A chiropractor will not hamper your craze for weight lifting but will help you with the right technique.\\nWith fewer chemicals on your system and the right places tapped, you will spring back to life, and a Brampton chiropractor will keep the wheels moving ever smoothly!',\n",

(AP) — Nearly a third of West Virginia\\'s public school students were truant during the 2013-2014 academic year and several counties had truancy rates exceeding 50 percent, Department of Education figures show.\\nThe highest truancy rate was in McDowell County, where 58 percent of students missed at least five days of classes without an excuse. Wyoming County had the second-highest rate, with 57 percent of students marked as truant.\\nJefferson County had the lowest rate, 7 percent. The rate in Kanawha County, the state\\'s largest school district, was 34 percent.\\nThe statewide truancy rate was about 31 percent.\\nMcDowell County Superintendent Nelson Spencer told The Sunday Gazette-Mail (http://bit.ly/1sPz2q6 ) that truancy cases are a byproduct of poverty and drug abuse.\\n\"It all ties together. You really can\\'t separate one from another,\" Spencer told the newspaper. \"We like to reach out to the students themselves. We deal with the students one-on-one more than we do the parents.\"\\nThe school system has hired \"graduation coaches\" to spend extra time with at-risk students in the county\\'s high schools. Reconnecting McDowell, a public-private partnership, has provided resources that have contributed to engaging students and making them want to come to school more than before, Spencer said.\\nJefferson County school officials have made a strong push to reduce truancy, said Sheri Hoff, the county\\'s director of attendance.\\n\"Our numbers were astronomically high nearly a decade ago — near 80 percent. We weren\\'t really identifying them then. Now, we have a concerted effort. A bus driver, a cafeteria manager, they all make calls to let us know,\" Hoff told the newspaper. \"We have pushed very hard for a number of years to get (students) here and to get interventions in place.\"\\nKanawha County Magistrate Traci Carper-Strickland, who oversees truancy cases in the county, said she likes to consider herself as a last resort.\\n\"I don\\'t know if people are afraid or too proud to ask for that help, but it\\'s there. They need to know it\\'s there, and they need to be able to ask for it,\" she said. \"As far as I\\'m concerned, there is no punishment for students. We\\'re trying to keep them out of court. We give them the opportunity to correct the problem without having to see a judge.\"\\nParents are responsible in truancy cases involving a student under the age of 12. They could face fines for the first offense and jail time for a second offense.\\nInformation from: The Charleston Gazette, http://www.wvgazette.com\\nCopyright © The Associated Press.

       " {'text': '20 Feb 2020 The custom of Ciknopempti\\nThe second Thursday of the Triodion, the Creatine. (period of Carnival) is called Ciknopempti ( Cikna = the smell of burning meat and Pempti = Thursday), because on this day all the houses roast meat or melt the fat from the pork and the ‘Cikna’ is widespread all over the country!\\nThe origins of the custom probably date back to the Bacchusian feasts of the ancient Greeks and the Romans, and survived with variations up to the Christian years. Plagiarism and polytheism, characteristic of that day, are reminiscent of land-based practices that, when combined with Christian tradition, mean preparation for the Great Lent.\\nAccording to the Orthodox tradition, in anticipation of Lent and observing the fasts of Wednesday and Friday, Cikno Thursday was placed between, as a day of relief with “nodding” and croaking.\\nThe ‘protocol’ also requires disguise and teasing. In the villages, people turn around from door to door, knocking on the doors of known and unknown people, demanding drink and wine, which was abundantly consumed and along the way, demanding that the housewives leave their homes and follow the hordes. The custom even includes “damage” to the exterior of the houses, where passersby throw the pots down to spill the soil in the yards, smear their faces, and the fun continues until morning.\\nOver the course of time, each place developed its own special customs.\\nIn the Peloponnese, pork is slaughtered, after which traditional delicacies such as cloves, cigarettes, pastes and gourds are prepared.\\nIn Cyclades, engaged couples exchange as confessional, edible items. The fiancee sends the kourkos, while the fiancee sends a stuffed hen to eat on Carnival Sunday and baklava.\\nAnd so it goes through the country and the centuries!',\n",

Fair enough I slept most of it all but the meal and half a inflight movie and a little sightseeing on the little screen and out the windows.

I longed for a sleep and then be ready for the next day… Gav had other plans. We went to the hotel to book in and dump our bags…. the bed looked so inviting yet we were out as quick as it took me to look around the one bedroom en-suite room.

Yet everything still the Disney way, perfection at every glance, not a blade of grass out of place. the music and happiness of everyone filled the air and a glance at the castle made my knees shake, i was here, i was in Disney i was happy!\\nWe rushed to space mountain and Gavin stopped…. The ride looked dark and the adjoining gift shop looked quiet. the ride was shut. On talking to staff it had closed 3 days prior due to a technical fult that made it unsafe. With this news Gavin was not defeated and started leading me into rides. Reluctantly yet still happy and buzzing from being in disney, being in america and being thousands of miles away from home I went….. I was enjoying every minute yet had in my thought that I knew it wasn’t right and I needed to stop, anyway we went on a couple of rides then went onto buzz light years lazer blast. This was a toy story ride where you shoot the aliens with lasers, It was also a big mistake. 1/4 of the way into the ride I saw all the lights blur and go into bold block colours with a angel like rim around them. The next think I knew I was back stage! Although back stage of disney may sound great it’s not the way that I wanted to see it. Id already made plans of how i would one day see disney back stage by being a reporter for the disney blog or being a cast member for a year…. this was not in my plans.\\nDisney back stage is just as a wow factor and disneyfied as the rest of Disney, there is cast land and costume land! I’m not joking it’s amazing. I just wish I saw more of where I was… I drifted off and woke up in our hotel room.\\nThe rest of the holiday was great. I went on rides, saw characters and i was with the love of my life. yet some things just felt wrong, but i didn’t know how. I put it down to being home sick… although i had travelled without mum before this was the furthest i’d been. I’d backpacked around france, belgium and been to amsterdam yet this seemed more scary! yet I was protected in a disney bubble.\\nIn america disney is like a little country. It has its own free police force, ambulance service, medical centres, life guards, fire department and a whole host of other normal paying services. if you had the money disney also offers hair dressers, laundrettes, spas, nail parlours, insurance, andd shopping all in its resort. These are all very pricey but if you were a millionaire and loved disney as much as i do America disney is the place to spend your millions.\\nThe only thing I didn’t like was the water parks they were too scary for me… I was quite happy floating round the perimeter on the rubber rings though.,. I did enjoy the bit where you put on a life jacket and let the current take you round the outskirts of the park like your white water swimming. That was fun! but the fast wirling speed down a ramp on a water thing rides are not me. the thought of being up that high and needed to get down and the only option being a water flume scared the pants off me… it did happen once and i went down the flume which made my mind up that never again would i submit myself to the experience !\\nI really love Disney. I had not been on many roller coasters in my life and id never visited a theme park other than margate dreamland and disney for a day however I’d fallen in love with rock and roller coaster staring aerosmith. While I was at Disney I promised myself I would do everything….but especially go on r&r! i did. And I did do a lot more ! I’m so proud as I even went on tower of terror which is a elevator that goes up and drops you from the 13th floor…. Now that’s fine but I had a fear of normal elevators so this was crazy for me to even think of going on it… Yet I did!\\nI went on all the rides had to offer.. Some were ok others I had to go round again! But I struggled through. I saw backstage of rock and roller coaster after watching the 3,2,1 light sign while in the cue and then having a seizure but I kept on going. How I dont know.\\nWe split our holiday with a week and a half at Disney and a week at the royal pacific hotel next to universal studios. I was so so tired at the end of the holiday.. I wasn’t Eating much as It was so hot and I don’t do well in English heat let alone this new american heat. The heat here was severe, the mid day sun hovered over your head and your shaddow disappeared from 11am till 3pm. The combination of not eating, lots and lots of walking, and the seizures meant I lost 3 stone in 2 weeks. I knew i was feeling weak but i didn’t realise it was so bad but when I got home it shocked people. especially mum. I was skin and bone. I found things hard when I got home… I was weak, tired, still having seizures and still not able to eat much. I couldn’t get an appointment with my dr for a week so I went back to work and continued studying. I didn’t want to loose my dream of being a nurse.\\nMy studying finished and my portfolio handed in I was working full time on the ward loving every second of patient care, i was learning something new everyday and had applied for 4 jobs with a promise of a placement in the radiology theatres, the other applications were just a process you went through, the radiology position was my dream and i couldn’t believe i was going straight into it. I continued to work hard. I was finding it difficult and I wasn’t strong enough, and I knew it yet I struggled and struggled not letting it show.\\nOne night I finished work, I knew I needed to go home…. Gavin was working a all night shift so we met and had coffee then i went home with mum. She picked me up and I got home in my bed and slept.\\nI had a bad night as far as seizures went and the next day was so bad mum had to phone In sick to my work. I was basically out of it. Throughout the day I had 15 -20 seizures though i was recovering in between and slept. by 9 o’clock when Gavin came over i was getting worse when i had had 4 seizures in a row without recovery he phoned straight through to margate hospital and then put me in the car and took me to margate A & E. Life was about to change.',\n",

       " {'text': 'If you dread thunderstorms or rain showers because they leave your yard sopping wet for days, a rain garden might be the solution for you. As gardeners, we’re always looking for ways to treat and fit things within our homes naturally. A rain garden can solve many problems homeowners have with a natural and beautiful solution.\\nRain gardens are planted in a depressed area, usually formed on a natural slope in landscaping, and contain moisture-loving, native plants. These gardens capture rain from roofs, parking lots, driveways, and streets. It takes this water that would otherwise fill and destroy culverts, pods, streams, and other natural water systems and allows it to soak slowly and naturally into the soil. Rain gardens are an affordable and accessible solution for residential storm runoff issues.\\nRain showers may not seem like they’re producing a lot of water until you do the math. For example, an inch of rain on 1,000 square feet is 623 gallons of water. That’s a lot of water! Imagine 623 gallons of milk being dumped down the drain. Instead of letting that natural resource go to waste, catch the water with a rain garden and grow something beautiful!\\nIn areas where neighborhoods and cities are inundated with parking lots, driveways, and roofs, rainwater can cause huge problems for both structures and surrounding natural waters. When rainwater rushes down gutters and into culverts, the water table gets filled with contaminants that otherwise would naturally filter out through the soil. Rain gardens take the run off and allow it to slowly soak into the ground. This process filters out contaminants the water picked up along the way and recharges the groundwater. When done correctly, it can reduce the amount of flooding during heavy storms.\\nIn addition, it’s recommended that rain gardens be filled with native plants. These plants are already accustomed to the area and need less maintenance. Plus, since the gardens are naturally watered, they ultimately save on water usage and add a beautiful area to your yard. Save time, save money, and save the environment? It sounds like a win-win-win situation!\\nThe use of native plants in rain gardens is crucial to why they are so good for the ecosystem around your home. The native plants invite essential pollinators including bees and butterflies. The chemicals and sprays used today are exterminating an alarming amount of pollinators that are vital to the environment. Rain gardens can be a sanctuary for these amazing insects. These gardens also create an excellent space for birds to find bedding for nests and food from beneficial insects.\\nIf your yard has an issue with standing water that attracts mosquito breeding, rain gardens will help combat that problem, too.\\nDepending on which plant hardiness zone you’re in, your choice of native plants is almost endless. Most designs incorporate perennial flowering plants and plants with more foliage. This mixture creates a balanced feel to the garden.\\nAlthough different plants can be used in various zones, a few are used in almost all rain gardens across the U.S.\\n- Aster is a bushy flowering plant with little purple flowers.\\n- Daylilies come in many colors and are bright and eye-catching.\\n- Irises have uniquely shaped purple and white blooms.\\n- Sedum is a large group of flowering plants that are hardy and grow quickly.\\n- Coneflowers have daisy-like flowers with large cone-shaped centers.\\n- Artemisia is also known as mugworts; these plants have beautiful bright green foliage.\\n- Sedge is a group of plants that grow like large grasses and come in various shades of green.\\nNo matter the type of flowers you choose to put in your rain garden, your home, local waterways, and native plants and insects will thank you. And you’ll do a happy dance when you see your water bill!\\n- Sun-loving succulents: How to make a charming outdoor succulent garden\\n- If you live in climate zone 8, these are the best plants to grow right now\\n- 7 colorful spring plants that will beautify your fence line and give you privacy\\n- These are the 10 best gardening shows to stream right now\\n- Transform your garden this summer with these 6 DIY pallet garden design ideas',\n",

The first bisexual rock star was Sister Rosetta Tharpe, a rock and roll pioneer.\\nMany lesbian, gay, bi, and trans rock musicians were in the closet for years or even decades before coming out. Many of these musicians are people you’ve heard of.\\nClassic rock is for all to enjoy, no matter your sexual orientation.

Enjoy!\\nAlice de Buhr – lesbian – Drummer for the band Fanny.\\nAndy Fraser – gay – Bassist and founding member of Free. He formed the band when he was 15. He co-wrote and produced the band’s biggest hit, “All Right Now” and the song came out just before his 18th birthday. He was born in London to a Caribbean father and an English mother and started playing piano at the age of 5 and trained classically for 7 years before switching to guitar. He was expelled from school at 15 and started playing in East End West Indian venues. One day, he was introduced to Alexis Korner, who basically was a mentor to him. Still aged 15, he got his first big gig playing bass for John Mayall. At 16, he formed Free. The band went on to play at the Isle of Wight Festival 1970 and were considered hard rock pioneers. The band broke up in 1973. Paul Rodgers and Simon Kirke went on to join Bad Company. Andy Fraser formed Sharks. Paul Kossoff formed Back Street Crawler, but died at the age of 25.\\nArthur Conley – gay – Soul singer best known for the 1967 hit “Sweet Soul Music” (#2 US), which was a remake of Sam Cooke’s “Yeah Man”. In 1964, he released the song “I’m a Lonely Stranger”. Otis Redding was so impressed with it that he signed him to his record label, Jotis Records. In the 70s, he moved to the UK and later the Netherlands and changed his name to Lee Roberts. Some claim that the reason he left the US was because people didn’t accept his sexuality. He passed away in 2003.\\nBilly Preston – gay – R&B and soul singer and session musician. He grew up listening to gospel music and that had an influence on his singing. As a kid, he played organ backing gospel singers Mahalia Jackson and James Cleveland. He was a Christian and that made it hard for him to come out of the closet and he didn’t come out until right before his death. He released his debut album when he was 16, 16 Year Old Soul. It was released on Sam Cooke’s SAR Records. He did session and touring keyboard work for The Beatles (and later on George Harrison), Eric Clapton, The Rolling Stones, Little Richard, and Ray Charles. He was signed to the Beatles’ Apple Records in 1969 and recorded two albums on that label: That’s The Way God Planned It and Encouraging Words. In the 70s, he got a few big hits: “Outa-Space”, “Will It Go Around In Circles”, “Space Race”, and “Nothing From Nothing”.\\nBilly Wright – gay – Jump blues singer and major influence on Little Richard, even helped him get a record deal and inspired his flamboyant image. He grew up singing gospel music at church. He also liked to do drag.\\nBoy George – gay – Lead singer of 80s new wave band Culture Club. He is one of the biggest icons of the New Romantic movement of the early 80s, a subculture known for flamboyant fashion and heavy makeup inspired by glam rock and historic fashion. Culture Club were a multicultural band with band members of Irish, Black, and Jewish descent. In 1982, the band got their first #1 hit in the UK, “Do You Really Want to Hurt Me”. Within the next few years, they got top 10 hits with “Karma Chameleon”, “Church of the Poison Mind”, and “The War Song”.\\nBrian Jones – bicurious – Guitarist, founding member of The Rolling Stones, and in my opinion the most fabulous member of the band. Allegedly, Brian Jones had a crush on Dave Davies.\\nChuck Panozzo – gay – Bassist for the band Styx. He started the band in his hometown of Chicago. He still tours to this day with Styx part time. Styx are a hard/prog rock band best known for the songs “Lady”, “Renegade”, “Come Sail Away”, and “Mr Roboto”. The band released their first album in 1972. He came out in 2001 as gay and said he has AIDS. Of this he says “What the band has taught me psychologically is that I need to go out and be with my band as they continue their legacy in the rock n’ roll world forever. How could that not help me in my recovery process? I have a band that is willing to make sure that I stay healthy.” Of his sexuality and being closeted in the 70s at the peak of Styx’s popularity he says “I was one of those closeted, clandestine type of guys. We would tour like crazy, and my initiation into the gay scene was stifled by the fact that I wasn’t out publicly. When I was on the road with Styx—I’m the bass player—sometimes I would separate from the band and I’d find a bar.” He is a big supporter of LGBT rights and AIDS awareness.\\nCris Williamson – lesbian – Folk singer and important figure in the women’s music movement. She was born in South Dakota and raised in Colorado and Wyoming. At the age of 16, she released her first album, The Artistry of Cris Williamson. Her 1975 album The Changer and the Changed (released on women’s music record label Olivia Records) was one of the best selling independently released albums of all time, selling over half a million copies.\\nDave Davies – bisexual – Member of The Kinks. He mainly played guitar and sang in the band. He started the band with his brother, Ray, and friend Pete Quaife. The Kinks were a major part of The British Invasion, touring the world with bands such as The Yardbirds and The Honeycombs. They continued to release albums into the 80s. However, they were banned from touring the States in 1965 because a complaint was filed with a musicians union in the US for apparently misbehaving on stage. Their influences range from the blues to skiffle to British music hall. My favourite songs of theirs include “You Really Got Me”, “All Day And All Of The Night”, “A Well Respected Man”, “Victoria”, “Waterloo Sunset”, and “Lola”. Dave Davies opened up about his sexuality in his autobiography, Kink. Dave Davies now tours solo.\\nDave Wakeling – bisexual – Lead vocalist of ska band The Beat. The Beat’s first two albums, I Just Can’t Stop It and Wha’ppen?, peaked at #3 on the UK album charts. My favourite song he wrote for the band is “Save it For Later”, released in 1982 on the band’s last album, Special Beat Service. He wrote the song when he was a teenager, before he formed The Beat. The band originally didn’t want to record it because it was “too rock.”\\nDavid Bowie – bisexual – Got his big break in the music business with “Space Oddity” in 1969. Since then he changed his image many times from the androgynous “The Man Who Sold The World” era to the glam rock “Ziggy Stardust” to “The Thin White Duke”. He was well known for his stage personas and loved to act as those characters. As well as his image changing, his music has changed a lot as well. There’s something for everyone in his discography. He and his wife in the 70s, Angie, were bisexual. David Bowie’s inspirations included American rock and roll, skiffle, and Bob Dylan. He was also inspired by contemporaries: Lou Reed, Iggy Pop, and Marc Bolan. He got to work with Lou Reed and did some vocals on the album Transformer. He was on Marc Bolan’s 1977 show, Marc, performing with Bolan. He came out as bisexual in the 70s. He was well known for the songs “Changes”, “Queen Bitch”, “Starman”, “Rebel Rebel”, “Heroes”, “Let’s Dance”, and “Under Pressure” (with Queen).\\nDebbie Harry – bisexual – Got famous in the 70s and 80s as the lead singer for the band Blondie. Blondie’s best known songs are “Heart of Glass”, “One Way Or Another”, “Call Me”, and “Rapture”. Before Blondie she was in a band in the 60s called The Wind In The Willows, was a go-go dancer, and was a Playboy Bunny. As well as being a musician she is an actress. She came out in a 2014 interview with the Daily Mail. She also refused to perform in the Sochi Olympics due to homophobia in Russia. Of her sexuality she says “Sure, I was in a relationship with a man for almost 20 years and I’ve had other relationships with men, but I’ve also had them with women. I find it very strange that people are less willing to accept that you’re bisexual if you’ve had long-term relationships predominantly with men.”\\nDee Palmer – transgender and intersex – Member of Jethro Tull from 1977 to 1980, but she did play a part in their albums from 1969-1976, providing orchestral arrangements. Besides working with Jethro Tull, she arranged other classic rock bands music in an orchestral style, such as Queen, The Beatles, Genesis, and Yes.\\nDug Pinnick – gay – Bassist, songwriter, and co-lead vocalist of hard rock band King’s X. He often plays a 12 string bass. The band had a new wave sound and began as Sneak Preview, releasing only one album in 1983 under that name. After that, they toured and moved to Houston, where they met Sam Taylor, who worked for ZZ Top’s production company and suggested they change their name to King’s X. They released their first album as King’s X in 1988, called Out of the Silent Planet. It has a much different sound from the last one, with a more prog metal sound. The following year, they released their second album, Gretchen Goes to Nebraska. When Dug Pinnick came out as gay in the 90s, Christian shops stopped carrying King’s X albums.\\nDusty Springfield – lesbian – English blue eyed soul singer. She started her career in the 50s singing in holiday camps. In the 60s she was one of the best known British female singers. Her first solo single was released in 1963, “I Only Want To Be With You” and it was a success. She wrote a few songs, but her biggest hits were covers and songs written by other songwriters. In 1964 she released “Wishin’ and Hopin'”. In 1968 she released “Son of a Preacher Man”, one of her biggest hits. She was a big fan of Motown and her sound was influenced by musicians from that record label. She even hosted a Ready Steady GoI special featuring Motown artists such as The Temptations, The Miracles, The Supremes, and Stevie Wonder. This is part of the early beginnings of Northern Soul. She worked with musicians like Kiki Dee and Elton John. She came out as bisexual in 1970, which took a lot of bravery. In reality though, she was lesbian and needed a cover because if it was known she was gay, her career could be over.\\nElton John – gay – Went from playing piano at pubs to being one of the best selling musicians ever. The third best selling musician in the United States, only behind Elvis and The Beatles. He played music that had anything from an R&B sound to a more progressive rock sound.

I really enjoy the album Tumbleweed Connection.\\nEric Emerson – bisexual – Actor, dancer, and musician who was part of the Andy Warhol Factory scene. He was the lead vocalist of the glam punk band The Magic Tramps. If you like The Velvet Underground and Lou Reed, you’ll like The Magic Tramps.

When his father found out he was bi, he said to him, “What he don’t understand is that my generation can swing both ways.”\\nEsquerita – gay – Born Eskew Reeder Jr in South Carolina, he was another influence of Little Richard’s.

He is known for his trademark spoken delivery, known as sprechgesang (seriously German has some pretty awesome words to describe things that don’t have an English word. I really should learn German). He wrote the band’s debut single, which launched the band into stardom, “Rock Lobster” with bandmate Ricky Wilson. This song is a very good example of Fred Schneider’s vocal style.\\nFreddie Mercury – bisexual – Frontman for Queen. Before joining Queen, he went to the same art school as Pete Townshend, Ealing Art College. He joined a band called Smile with Brian May and Roger Taylor. All of the band members wrote songs that became hits for the band, but Freddie wrote a good amount of them. He had a wide range of influences from 50s rock to progressive rock to hard rock to disco.

Her peak fame was in the 80s with the release of gold albums Me Myself I, Walk Under Ladders, and The Key.

It topped the charts in South Africa and was a top 10 hit in Australia, and reached #11 in the UK.\\nJoan Jett – doesn’t like labels, so I’ll say sapphic which is a term for women who like women (WLWs) – You can’t write about LGBT rock stars without talking about Joan Jett, who very much values privacy when it comes to her love life. She never confirmed or denied rumours that she is lesbian or bisexual. She tells people to assume away. That said, she said this to the New York Times in response to a question about a movie about her playing at an LGBT film festival when she’s not out:\\nJobriath – gay – Released his first album called Pidgeon in 1969 before he was known as Jobriath. Very similar to David Bowie and Peter Gabriel in the way that he wore very odd costumes on stage. Many consider him the first gay rock star.

He died of AIDS in 1983 and was one of the first famous musicians to die of AIDS.\\nJohn Lennon – bisexual – Does he need any introduction? One of the major songwriters of The Beatles and had a successful solo career. In 2015, Yoko Ono revealed that John Lennon was bisexual. Of his sexuality, Yoko said:\\n“John and I had a big talk about it, saying, basically, all of us must be bisexual. And we were sort of in a situation of thinking that we’re not [bisexual] because of society. So we are hiding the other side of ourselves, which is less acceptable.”\\nJohnnie Ray – gay – If you’re not familiar with music of the 50s, you must have heard this name in the opening lyrics of Dexys Midnight Runners’ “Come On Eileen”. He was more of a jazz and pop singer, but his music was influential in rock and roll, and he’s considered to have been a pioneer in the genre. Ringo Starr said that the three singers The Beatles listened to most were Chuck Berry, Little Richard, and Johnnie Ray. He grew up in Oregon and became deaf in one ear as a childhood because of an accident during a Boy Scout ritual. He wore hearing aids during performances. In the early 50s, he got into R&B music and gained a following at black nightclubs. He became known for his over the top theatrics while performing, which gave him the nickname Mr Emotion. He was in one movie in 1954, There’s No Business Like Show Business, with Ethel Merman and Marilyn Monroe. The 60s was very different from the 50s music and style wise and anything old was out, but he didn’t stop performing entirely. In 1969, he toured Europe with Judy Garland and was best man at her wedding. He struggled with drinking from the 60s until his death in 1990 of liver failure.\\nAs for his sexuality, before he was famous, he was arrested in Detroit for cruising in the toilets, soliciting an undercover officer for sex. Because he wasn’t famous at the time, the newspapers didn’t report it. He was briefly married to a woman named Marilyn Morrison, at the peak of his fame. He was arrested again there at the end of the decade for soliciting an undercover officer for sex at a bar. There were rumours throughout his career that he was gay, but he never publicly came out. Still, he had fan girls even though he was gay.\\nJohnny Mathis – gay – Pop singer-songwriter with a long career starting in the 50s and even got a few hits in the 70s. In 2017, he came out as gay in an interview with CBS News Sunday Morning. He said this to Us Magazine: “I come from San Francisco. It’s not unusual to be gay in San Francisco. I’ve had some girlfriends, some boyfriends, just like most people. But I never got married, for instance. I knew that I was gay.”\\nJudee Sill – bisexual – Country singer-songwriter from the 70s. She had relationships with both men and women.\\nJune Millington – lesbian – Member of all girl group Fanny. She’s the lead guitarist of the band.

She was part of the Women’s music movement in the 70s. Recently she’s been working on an autobiography, Land of a Thousand Bridges, and does work with the Institute for the Musical Arts, which supports women interested in playing music. The organisation organises summer camps, workshops, and has a recording studio.\\nKate Pierson – bisexual – One of the singers of the B-52s. Her vocal harmonies with Cindy Wilson were a key part of the B-52s sound. She was born and raised in New Jersey. The band were formed in Athens, Georgia in 1976. The band went to a Chinese restaurant, had some drinks and after that they had a jam session. The band’s name comes from southern slang for a beehive hairstyle. True to the name, the band have a very retro aesthetic, a throwback to the 60s, but with a more modern sound. In 2003, Kate started dating Monica Coleman. In 2015 they got married. She has described herself as a “late-in-life-lesbian”. In an interview with Al Jazeera, she said this about her stance on transgender rights: “Well, I’m bisexual, and I was always with men, and now I’m with Monica for 11 years, going on 12, and so this is an issue that I care a lot about.” “Roam” is one of the band’s biggest hits and features some great vocals from Kate Pierson and Cindy Wilson.\\nKeith Strickland – gay – Originally the drummer of the B-52s, but after Ricky Wilson’s death, he became the guitarist. He came out as gay in 1992, after the band scored major hits like “Love Shack” and “Roam”. He is the main composer of the band, writing the music. In 2012, he retired from touring.\\nKlaus Nomi – gay – Iconic singer who was known for his stage persona and vocal range. He was born in Germany in 1944 and moved to New York City in 1972 and worked as a pastry chef while taking voice lessons. He performed in a satirical version of Richard Wagner’s Das Rheingold in 1972, but his big break came in the late 70s when he performed in “New Wave Vaudeville”. While at the performance, he met Kristian Hoffman of The Mumps and they collaborated, with Hoffman writing songs for him. He later played at the famous venue, Max’s Kansas City and sang with David Bowie on Saturday Night Live. What a way to end the 70s! He also worked with artists like Jean-Michel Basquiat and Keith Haring. His self-titled debut was released in 1981. Some songs I like from that album are “Lighting Strikes”, “Nomi Song”, a cover of Lesley Gore’s “You Don’t Own Me”, and “Total Eclipse”. The following year, he released Simple Man. Some highlights from the album are “After the Fall”, “Falling in Love Again”, “ICUROK”, and “Rubberband Lazer”. Klaus Nomi passed away in 1983 due to complications from AIDS. Right before his death, he was working on an opera. These songs recorded right before his death were released on a compilation album, Za Bakdaz, in 2007.\\nLance Loud and Kristian Hoffman of Mumps – gay – Lance Loud was the frontman and Kristian Hoffman was the keyboard player. Mumps performed at Max’s Kansas City, Hurrah, and CBGB and audiences liked them, but they never got signed to a major record label and only released two singles independently, “I Like To Be Clean” and “Rock & Roll This & That”.\\nLaura Nyro – bisexual – Singer-songwriter whose music style took diverse influences from jazz to gospel to r&b to show tunes. Her best known albums are Eli and the Thirteenth Confession and New York Tendaberry. Fans of her work include Todd Rundgren, Carole King, Joni Mitchell, Bette Midler, and Elton John. She released her first album in 1967 when she was 19. Songs from that album went on to be covered by other musicians such as Blood, Sweat & Tears, The 5th Dimension, and Barbra Streisand. She identified as a feminist and said that both the feminist movement and peace movement influenced her songwriting. She died of ovarian cancer in 1997 at the age of 49.\\nLes McKeown – bisexual – Lead singer of Scottish boy band The Bay City Rollers. Sang on the hits “Shang-a-Lang”, “Bye Bye Baby”, and “Saturday Night”.\\nLesley Gore – lesbian – Singer known for the songs “It’s My Party” and “You Don’t Own Me”. “It’s My Party” was a #1 for her while she was still in secondary school. She performed on the TAMI Show, a concert film from 1964. She was discovered by Quincy Jones. As well as being a singer, she wrote songs and acted. Her music was relatable to young people. In university she realised she was lesbian, but didn’t come out until after the peak of her career.\\nLittle Richard – identified as gay at one point, but some say he was bisexual – Rock and roll pioneer in so many ways. Not just in sound, but image. He was rocking androgyny way before the psychedelic and glam rock scenes. He’d wear flashy clothes and makeup. He was even a drag queen, performing under the name Princess LaVonne. Now, his relationship with his sexual orientation is a sad one. As you might know, he is religious and has trouble reconciling the two. He has called his sexual orientation unnatural. The original lyrics of his song, “Tutti Frutti”, referenced being with a man – “Tutti Frutti, good booty / If it don’t fit, don’t force it / You can grease it, make it easy.”\\nLong John Baldry – gay – A blues singer. He was known as “Long John” because he was 6’7″. He sang with Blues Incorporated, Cyril Davies R&B All Stars, and Steampacket. He released his first solo album in 1964, which had covers of “I Got My Mojo Workin”, “Hoochie Coochie Man”, and “Dimples”. He publicly came out as gay in the 70s.\\nLou Reed – bisexual – Singer for The Velvet Underground. He wrote most of their songs. He also had a successful solo career with well known songs such as “Satellite of Love” and “Walk on the Wild Side”. He wrote and sang a song called “Kill Your Sons” based on his father making him go to shock therapy sessions as a young adult. He moved to New York City in 1964 and then met John Cale and he got in touch with Sterling Morrison to start The Velvet Underground. The band were not commercially successful at the time, but they were still influential and people easily recognise The Velvet Underground And Nico album cover that Andy Warhol did. Andy Warhol were very important and mentored the band and they were part of the Exploding Plastic Inevitable. Lou Reed left the Velvet Underground in 1970 and had a solo career. He was known for having a unique sounding voice. Some Velvet Underground songs I recommend are “Sunday Morning”, “Heroin”, “I’m Set Free”, “Sweet Jane”, and “Rock & Roll”.\\nMarc Almond – gay – Singer-songwriter and half of pop duo Soft Cell. As a teenager, he got into rock music by listening to John Peel’s radio show. He was really into glam rock in its heyday. Before the fame, he went to art school and acted in some performance theatre pieces and short films. Soft Cell’s biggest hit was a cover of Gloria Jones’ “Tainted Love”, a popular song in the Northern Soul scene. He later had a solo career. Of his sexuality, he said he didn’t like being pigeonholed as a “gay musician” because it’s a way of marginalising someone’s work and making it seem less important and not appealing to the mainstream because it implies that it’s not important to those who aren’t gay. He’s right. Music doesn’t have a sexuality. It’s art and art is for all to enjoy.\\nMarc Bolan – bisexual – Marc Bolan was best known for his work under the T. Rex/Tyrannosaurus Rex moniker. His manager, Simon Napier-Bell said he was bisexual, but never was open about it. In an interview with Record Mirror, he said in response to a question asking if he was heterosexual, “No, bisexual, but I believe I’m more heterosexual ‘cos I definitely like boobs. I always wished I was 100 per cent gay, it’s much easier.” To sum up his career, he started off in a trio with Helen Shapiro, playing guitar. He was kicked out of school when he was 15 and became a model. He recorded his first single, the Cliff Richard-style “All At Once” in 1964, at the age of 17. The following year, he released another single called “The Wizard”. He was in one more band, John’s Children, before going on his own with Tyrannosaurus Rex/T. Rex. Tyrannosaurus Rex more folk sounding, with a psychedelia twist, and it’s a good bit different from his better-known glam rock stuff, but still amazing. During the folk era, he wrote a book of poems called The Warlock of Love. A couple of his early albums have really long titles like Prophets, Seers, and Sages: The Angels of the Ages or My People Were Fair and Had Stars in Their Hair, But Now They’re Content to Wear Stars on Their Brows. The year of change for Marc was 1970, when he released his first glam rock single, “Ride a White Swan”. From there, he changed his style to a glittery androgynous one, this was the beginning of his meteoric rise with hit after hit. The years 1971-1973 were his peak with hit singles like “Hot Love”, “Get it On”, “Jeepster”, “Telegram Sam”, “Metal Guru”, and “Children of the Revolution” either topping the charts or just barely missing it, peaking at #2. His popularity declined in the mid 70s, but he made a comeback in 1977, with a TV show called Marc. Punk bands like The Jam performed on the show. On the last episode of the show, he and David Bowie performed together. Two weeks before what would have been his 30th birthday, Marc Bolan passed away in a car crash.\\nMick Jagger – allegedly??? bicurious – I can’t say for sure if Mick Jagger is bisexual, which is why I avoided including him on this list for a long time. Allegedly, David Bowie’s wife Angie caught Mick Jagger and David Bowie in bed together. The two were androgynous rock stars who might have been open to experimenting with the same sex. Both Jagger and Bowie denied these rumours.\\nMorrissey – may be bisexual, but he doesn’t like labels – Singer of Manchester indie band The Smiths. He and Johnny Marr wrote the songs for the band. In the 70s, Morrissey would visit gay bars and clubs. In his autobiography he said that his first relationship was with a man. Songs like “This Charming Man”, “Handsome Devil”, “What Difference Does It Make”, and “Hand in Glove” have references to homosexuality.\\nNeil Tennant – gay – Singer and one half of The Pet Shop Boys, the most successful British pop duo. He met his bandmate, Chris Lowe, in London at an electronics shop and they got along because of their interest in electronic music. He was raised a Catholic and wrote the hit song “It’s A Sin” to describe his strict upbringing. He came out as gay in the 90s. The Pet Shop Boys are best known for the songs: “West End Girls”, “Rent”, “Heart”, and “Domino Dancing”.\\nNickey Barclay – bisexual – Keyboard player for the all-girl rock band Fanny. She came out a few years after she left the band.\\nNona Hendryx – bisexual – Distant cousin of Jimi Hendrix and singer of the group, LaBelle, whose biggest hits were “I Sold My Heart to the Junkman”, “Down the Aisle”, “You’ll Never Walk Alone”, and “Lady Marmalade”. They also have a cool cover medley of Thunderclap Newman’s “Something in the Air” and Gil Scott-Heron’s “The Revolution Will Not Be Televised”. LaBelle appeared on Laura Nyro’s 1971 album, Gonna Take a Miracle. Hendryx released her self-titled debut in 1977 with highlights like “Winning” and “Everybody Wants to Be Somebody”. She has worked with Tina Weymouth, Nancy Wilson, Peter Gabriel, Prince, and Keith Richards and sang on “Sun City” with Artists United Against Apartheid. In 2001, she spoke to The Advocate about her bisexuality.\\nNorma Tanega – unknown (not sure if lesbian or bisexual) – Folk singer from California. In her 20s she moved to Greenwich Village to pursue her dreams. She was in the folk scene there and was politically active, protesting the Vietnam War. For a time, she lived in England and dated Dusty Springfield, who she wrote some songs for. She released her first single in 1966, “Walking My Cat Named Dog” and that same year she released an album of the same name. Some good songs on that album are “You’re Dead”, “Jubilation”, and “A Street That Rhymes at 6am”.\\nPete Burns – can be described as bisexual and androgynous, but he did not like labels – Singer of Hi-NRG and synthpop band Dead or Alive. They were best known for the 1985 hit “You Spin Me Round (Like a Record)”. Pete Burns was from Liverpool. He worked at a record shop and was in a short-lived goth band called Nightmares in Wax, which only recorded a few songs and later on, after a lineup change, became Dead or Alive. He was known for his androgynous appearance and big hair. before their biggest hit “You Spin Me Round”, they had a minor hit, a cover of KC and The Sunshine Band’s “That’s The Way (I Like It)”. After those two songs, the band didn’t have any hits that matched that success.\\nPete Shelley – bisexual – Lead singer of Buzzcocks. He was born Peter McNeish in Lancashire and chose the stage last name Shelley as a tribute to his favourite poet, Percy Bysshe Shelley (husband of Mary Shelley). While at university, he formed Buzzcocks with some friends and they made their debut in 1976 opening for The Sex Pistols in Manchester. What made the pint-sized 5’4″ Pete Shelley stand out as a punk rocker was that he had a more clean, wholesome image, not a loud, rebellious image. He liked writing songs in a gender neutral way so everyone could relate to them, you might notice this in his band’s biggest hit “Ever Fallen In Love With Someone You Shouldn’t’ve”. Besides punk rock, he had an interest in electronic music and in his pre-Buzzcocks years he recorded an experimental Krautrock like album called Sky Yen. He resumed making electronic music in the 80s with albums like Homosapien and XL-1. “Homosapien” was his most overtly gay song, winning a ban from BBC radio for lyrics like “homo superior in my interior”. He identified as bisexual for his whole life. He died in 2018.\\nPete Townshend – bisexual – Guitarist and primary songwriter for The Who. He and Roger Daltrey continue to tour to this day. He was behind genius albums such as Tommy, Quadrophenia, and Who’s Next. He taught himself guitar. He dropped out of art school in 1964 because he was making more money than his own professors by playing gigs. He joined The Detours with John Entwistle and Roger Daltrey. The Detours became The Who and Keith Moon later joined the band. Pete Townshend suggested that they call themselves The Hair. Pete Meaden discovered them and changed their name briefly to The High Numbers. They went back to being The Who, being managed by Kit Lambert and Chris Stamp. Here’s their first single “I Can’t Explain”.\\nPeter Straker – gay – Played the part of Hud in the musical, Hair. Also was well known for working with Freddie Mercury, who produced one of Straker’s albums, This One’s On Me. He shared lead vocals with Jaki Whitren on the song “Some Other Time,” on the Alan Parsons Project album I Robot.\\nPhil May – bisexual – Pretty Things frontman. The Pretty Things are a band with a cult following, best known for the sad WWI concept album S.F. Sorrow, released in the tragedy-filled year of 1968. Famous fans of the band include David Bowie (who considered Phil May a god and wrote “Oh You Pretty Things” and covered two of their songs), David Gilmour, Mick Jagger, and The Who. He was born Philip Arthur Dennis Kattner and adopted the surname May from his aunt and uncle who raised him.\\nWhat made May stand out in the sea of British rockers of the 60s was his super long hair. In fact, he was said to have the longest hair of any British rocker in that era. His hair kept growing and by the 70s, he had chest length locks. It is unknown when he came out as bisexual, but he loved to switch around pronouns when covering songs and he said that he felt really confident about his androgynous looks.\\nPhranc – lesbian – Punk and folk singer-songwriter from Los Angeles who has a trademark androgynous look and influenced Queercore. Self-proclaimed “All-American Jewish Lesbian Folksinger”. She got her start in bands Nervous Gender and Catholic Discipline. She released her first solo album in 1985 called Folksinger. It’s worth listening to and there’s a cover of Bob Dylan’s “The Lonesome Death of Hattie Carroll”. Her second album released in 1989, I Enjoy Being a Girl has a better produced sound to it and she produced it with Violent Femmes producer Victor DeLorenzo.\\nRay Davies – bisexual – Leader, lead vocalist, and main songwriter of The Kinks. As I said earlier in the paragraph about Dave, the band have written quite a few songs about LGBT issues. He’s the more guarded and reserved of the two brothers, so it’s hard to get a straight answer about what he identifies as, but in this early 70s interview with Candy Darling, Tinkerbelle, and Glenn O’Brien he pretty much says it: he likes both men and women. “Why don’t you ask me what sort of men I like?” he asks. When Tinkerbelle asked him if he likes men, he said mhmm. He also said in a 1994 interview when asked about his sexuality, “I don’t know what I am. I’ve got female traits in me, male and female. I prefer people who are not ashamed to exhibit both. That doesn’t mean to say I have any bias one way or the other.”\\nRicky Wilson – gay – Original guitarist of the B-52s. He was a member of the band until his death in 1985. Two years before his death he found out he had AIDS and he kept his illness a secret from the rest of the band. He was one of the main songwriters of the band and would often collaborate with Fred Schneider and Keith Strickland. His guitar sound added to the quirkiness of the band. He was the first member of the band to come out as gay. Every member of the B-52s was gay or bisexual, except for Ricky Wilson’s sister, Cindy.\\nRob Halford – gay – Lead singer for hard rock band Judas Priest. He wrote or cowrote a lot of the band’s hits. The band’s influences include Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin, and Deep Purple. They released their first album, Rocka Rolla, in 1974. The band reached major success in 1979 and were famous throughout the 80s. You might know the song “Breaking The Law” because of Beavis and Butthead. Of coming out of the closet he says “It’s a wonderful moment when you walk out of the closet. Now I’ve done that and I’ve freed myself.”\\nThe Singing Nun – lesbian – A Belgian one-hit-wonder known for “Dominique”, released in 1963. Indeed it’s true she was a nun, but she left her convent when she was 1966. Later, she said she was forced out. That year, she reunited with her friend, Annie Pécher, who she knew from summer camp. Annie really liked her, but she didn’t feel the same way about her, at first. They moved in together and 14 years later, they had a romantic relationship. She owed the Belgian government a lot of money in back taxes from the royalties she received in the 60s from her hit and she didn’t have the money to pay them back because the money went to her religious congregation. She recorded a disco version of “Dominique”, but it didn’t go anywhere. She and her girlfriend started a centre to help children with autism and it had to shut down, leaving them devastated. She and Annie took their lives in 1985, overdosing on alcohol and barbiturates, and were buried together.\\nSiouxsie Sioux – bisexual – Lead singer of Siouxsie and the Banshees. She was born Susan Ballion in London. Her father was Belgian. As a child she was very lonely and dealt with a lot of trauma. One of her biggest inspirations was seeing David Bowie perform on Top of the Pops. As a teenager, she got better and went to gay clubs with her friends. She became a big fan of the Sex Pistols and wanted to make music of her own. What made her stand out in the scene is her gothic style. Siouxsie and the Banshees made their debut in 1978 and throughout the 80s they had a lot of success with many hit singles. She said in an interview, “I’ve never particularly said I’m hetero or I’m a lesbian. I know there are people who are definitely one way, but not really me. I suppose if I am attracted to men then they usually have more feminine qualities.”\\nSister Rosetta Tharpe – bisexual – While her career started in the late 30s, she was incredibly influential and considered the original soul sister and Godmother of Rock and Roll. Her beginnings were in gospel music and she quickly crossed over into R&B and rock and roll, being one of the first gospel musicians to do so. Songs from the late 1930s like “Rock Me”, “That’s All” and “This Train” demonstrate this and were commercial successes. Not only was she an influential singer, but also an influential guitarist who participated in guitar battles at the Apollo in Harlem. Unfortunately, she was the target of sexist and backhanded compliments like being told she “played like a man”. In actuality, she played guitar better than most of her male contemporaries. Her song “Strange Things Happening Every Day”, released in 1944, was the first gospel song to make the Harlem Hit Parade (later known as Race Records and R&B) and some consider it the first rock song. Some rumours claimed she dated gospel singer Marie Knight. She saw her perform at a Mahalia Jackson concert and invited her to tour with her. Sister Rosetta Tharpe remained active in the 60s, performing alongside musicians like Muddy Waters. She passed away in 1973 as a result of a stroke. Little Richard, Johnny Cash, Aretha Franklin, Isaac Hayes, Tina Turner, and Karen Carpenter called her a major influence.\\nShona Laing – bisexual – This Kiwi singer-songwriter got famous at the age of 17 with the song “1905”, released in 1972. The song reached #4 in her home country. Two follow up singles she released that year were successful: “Show Your Love” (#4 in the New Zealand charts) and “Masquerade” (#11 in the New Zealand charts). She had a comeback in the 80s with the songs “(Glad I’m) Not a Kennedy” and “Soviet Snow”. The most famous band she collaborated with were Manfred Mann’s Earth Band. She contributed vocals to some songs on the album Somewhere in Afrika. She came out as bisexual at a concert in 1996.\\nSylvester – gay – Disco musician best known for the song ‘You Make Me Feel Mighty Real”. He was known as “Queen of Disco”. He started off singing gospel music in church. He was also influenced by blues and jazz singers like Billie Holiday and Josephine Baker. He started The Disquotays as a teenager in the 60s with some friends he met at gay clubs. He was known for his androgynous dress sense. He moved to San Francisco in the 70s. Some other songs he made were “Dance (Disco Heat)”, “Do Ya Wanna Funk”, “Down Down Down”, and “Over and Over”.\\nTom Robinson – bisexual, but identifies as gay – Singer-songwriter and LGBT rights activist. He was the leader of the Tom Robinson Band. He was born in Cambridge, England and realised he was gay when he fell in love with a classmate. He started his band in 1976 and they released their debut single “2-4-6-8 Motorway” (which vaguely mentions a gay lorry driver) in 1977; it peaked at #5 in the UK charts. In 1978, they released a song called “Glad To Be Gay”, which was originally written for the 1976 London Pride parade and banned by the BBC. On sexuality, he said that he didn’t understand bisexuality at first, but then came to understand it better.\\nWendy Carlos – transgender – Best known for composing the scores for A Clockwork Orange and The Shining. She plays keyboard and synthesiser. She is also one of the first famous people to come out as trans, coming out in 1979 in an interview with Playboy Magazine. She also released albums that combined electronic and classical music like Switched-On Bach and The Well Tempered Synthesizer, from 1968 and 1969, respectively.\\nNot musicians, but were important to their careers:\\nAndy Warhol – gay – Manager and producer of The Velvet Underground. He was mostly known for his art and the Factory scene around it. The Factory scene had many drag queens, trans women, and LGBT celebrities and popular icons. He was one of the most famous openly gay people before the gay liberation movement took off.\\nBob Crewe – gay – Songwriter and record producer best known for his work co-writing songs with Bob Gaudio for Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons.\\nBrian Epstein – gay – Manager of The Beatles. Born to a Jewish family in Liverpool. Found out about The Beatles when they recorded “My Bonnie” with Tony Sheridan. He was in charge of the record department of the NEMS music store. The Beatles all frequented the shop. He was influential in creating the image of the band. Besides managing The Beatles, he managed Gerry & The Pacemakers and Billy J. Kramer and the Dakotas.\\nDesmond Child – gay – Songwriter who wrote hits like “I Was Made For Loving You”, “I Hate Myself For Loving You”, “Livin’ on a Prayer”, and “Dude Looks Like a Lady”.\\nJoe Meek – gay – Producer, sound engineer, and songwriter who worked with quite a few early-mid 60s artists from the UK like The Tornados, Screaming Lord Sutch, Heinz, Billy Fury, Tom Jones, The Honeycombs, and Tommy Steele. If you like the cosmic sounds of Hawkwind and Pink Floyd, you might want to thank Joe Meek since he was a pioneer in the space rock genre, writing the successful song “Telstar” in 1962. The song went to #1 before the British Invasion began, being the first American #1 by a British band. Not only that, but he even released a space-themed concept album in 1960 called I Hear a New World.\\nJohn Reid – gay – Former manager for Elton John and Queen.

He also managed 60s singer Georgie Fame who reached #1 with “Yeh Yeh”. He was known for giving the musicians unique stage names that were supposed to correspond with traits they had.\\nMichael Aldred – gay – Co-presenter of Ready Steady Go! Got his start in music by writing articles for a magazine called Jazz News. He auditioned for teen advisor for a pop music series, Ready Steady Go! in 1963 and was one of the two selected to present. The other was Cathy McGowan. The producer of the show wanted to make it more appealing to youth by having presenters from the same generation. He was only 18 and a half when he started presenting Ready Steady Go! and was the youngest TV presenter in Britain. He later had flings with Andrew Loog Oldham and Dave Davies. He tried releasing music of his own, but it didn’t go anywhere so he went into producing music and went back to his roots in music reviewing, writing for Goldmine and Audio. He died in April 1995.\\nRichard O’Brien – transgender (possibly non-binary) – Actor and TV presenter best known for writing the cult classic Rocky Horror Picture Show.

Jeroboam was standing by the altar to make offerings.\\n2 And the man cried against the altar by the word of the Lord and said, “O altar, altar, thus says the Lord: ‘Behold, a son shall be born to the house of David, Josiah by name, and he shall sacrifice on you the priests of the high places who make offerings on you, and human bones shall be burned on you.’”\\n3 And he gave a sign the same day, saying, “This is the sign that the Lord has spoken: ‘Behold, the altar shall be torn down, and the ashes that are on it shall be poured out.’”\\n4 And when the king heard the saying of the man of God, which he cried against the altar at Bethel, Jeroboam stretched out his hand from the altar, saying, “Seize him.” And his hand, which he stretched out against him, dried up, so that he could not draw it back to himself.\\n5 The altar also was torn down, and the ashes poured out from the altar, according to the sign that the man of God had given by the word of the Lord.\\n6 And the king said to the man of God, “Entreat now the favor of the Lord your God, and pray for me, that my hand may be restored to me.” And the man of God entreated the Lord, and the king’s hand was restored to him and became as it was before.\\n7 And the king said to the man of God, “Come home with me, and refresh yourself, and I will give you a reward.”\\n8 And the man of God said to the king, “If you give me half your house, I will not go in with you. And I will not eat bread or drink water in this place,\\n9 for so was it commanded me by the word of the Lord, saying, ‘You shall neither eat bread nor drink water nor return by the way that you came.’”\\n10 So he went another way and did not return by the way that he came to Bethel.\\nThe Prophet’s Disobedience11 Now an old prophet lived in Bethel. And his sons came and told him all that the man of God had done that day in Bethel. They also told to their father the words that he had spoken to the king.\\n12 And their father said to them, “Which way did he go?” And his sons showed him the way that the man of God who came from Judah had gone.\\n13 And he said to his sons, “Saddle the donkey for me.” So they saddled the donkey for him and he mounted it.\\n14 And he went after the man of God and found him sitting under an oak. And he said to him, “Are you the man of God who came from Judah?” And he said, “I am.”\\n15 Then he said to him, “Come home with me and eat bread.”\\n16 And he said, “I may not return with you, or go in with you, neither will I eat bread nor drink water with you in this place,\\n17 for it was said to me by the word of the Lord, ‘You shall neither eat bread nor drink water there, nor return by the way that you came.’”\\n18 And he said to him, “I also am a prophet as you are, and an angel spoke to me by the word of the Lord, saying, ‘Bring him back with you into your house that he may eat bread and drink water.’” But he lied to him.\\n19 So he went back with him and ate bread in his house and drank water.\\n20 And as they sat at the table, the word of the Lord came to the prophet who had brought him back.\\n21 And he cried to the man of God who came from Judah, “Thus says the Lord, ‘Because you have disobeyed the word of the Lord and have not kept the command that the Lord your God commanded you,\\n22 but have come back and have eaten bread and drunk water in the place of which he said to you, Eat no bread and drink no water, your body shall not come to the tomb of your fathers.’”\\n23 And after he had eaten bread and drunk, he saddled the donkey for the prophet whom he had brought back.\\n24 And as he went away a lion met him on the road and killed him. And his body was thrown in the road, and the donkey stood beside it; the lion also stood beside the body.\\n25 And behold, men passed by and saw the body thrown in the road and the lion standing by the body. And they came and told it in the city where the old prophet lived.\\n26 And when the prophet who had brought him back from the way heard of it, he said, “It is the man of God who disobeyed the word of the Lord; therefore the Lord has given him to the lion, which has torn him and killed him, according to the word that the Lord spoke to him.”\\n27 And he said to his sons, “Saddle the donkey for me.” And they saddled it.\\n28 And he went and found his body thrown in the road, and the donkey and the lion standing beside the body. The lion had not eaten the body or torn the donkey.\\n29 And the prophet took up the body of the man of God and laid it on the donkey and brought it back to the city to mourn and to bury him.\\n30 And he laid the body in his own grave. And they mourned over him, saying, “Alas, my brother!”\\n31 And after he had buried him, he said to his sons, “When I die, bury me in the grave in which the man of God is buried; lay my bones beside his bones.\\n32 For the saying that he called out by the word of the Lord against the altar in Bethel and against all the houses of the high places that are in the cities of Samaria shall surely come to pass.”\\n33 After this thing Jeroboam did not turn from his evil way, but made priests for the high places again from among all the people. Any who would, he ordained to be priests of the high places.\\n34 And this thing became sin to the house of Jeroboam, so as to cut it off and to destroy it from the face of the earth.\\n1 KINGS 14\\n« 1 Kings 13 | 1 Kings 14 | 1 Kings 15 »\\nProphecy Against Jeroboam 14:1 At that time Abijah the son of Jeroboam fell sick.\\n2 And Jeroboam said to his wife, “Arise, and disguise yourself, that it not be known that you are the wife of Jeroboam, and go to Shiloh. Behold, Ahijah the prophet is there, who said of me that I should be king over this people.\\n3 Take with you ten loaves, some cakes, and a jar of honey, and go to him. He will tell you what shall happen to the child.”\\n4 Jeroboam’s wife did so. She arose and went to Shiloh and came to the house of Ahijah. Now Ahijah could not see, for his eyes were dim because of his age.\\n5 And the Lord said to Ahijah, “Behold, the wife of Jeroboam is coming to inquire of you concerning her son, for he is sick. Thus and thus shall you say to her.”\\nWhen she came, she pretended to be another woman.\\n6 But when Ahijah heard the sound of her feet, as she came in at the door, he said, “Come in, wife of Jeroboam. Why do you pretend to be another? For I am charged with unbearable news for you.\\n7 Go, tell Jeroboam, ‘Thus says the Lord, the God of Israel: Because I exalted you from among the people and made you leader over my people Israel\\n8 and tore the kingdom away from the house of David and gave it to you, and yet you have not been like my servant David, who kept my commandments and followed me with all his heart, doing only that which was right in my eyes,\\n9 but you have done evil above all who were before you and have gone and made for yourself other gods and metal images, provoking me to anger, and have cast me behind your back,\\n10 therefore behold, I will bring harm upon the house of Jeroboam and will cut off from Jeroboam every male, both bond and free in Israel, and will burn up the house of Jeroboam, as a man burns up dung until it is all gone.\\n11 Anyone belonging to Jeroboam who dies in the city the dogs shall eat, and anyone who dies in the open country the birds of the heavens shall eat, for the Lord has spoken it.’\\n12 Arise therefore, go to your house. When your feet enter the city, the child shall die.\\n13 And all Israel shall mourn for him and bury him, for he only of Jeroboam shall come to the grave, because in him there is found something pleasing to the Lord, the God of Israel, in the house of Jeroboam.\\n14 Moreover, the Lord will raise up for himself a king over Israel who shall cut off the house of Jeroboam today. And henceforth,\\n15 the Lord will strike Israel as a reed is shaken in the water, and root up Israel out of this good land that he gave to their fathers and scatter them beyond the Euphrates, because they have made their Asherim, provoking the Lord to anger.\\n16 And he will give Israel up because of the sins of Jeroboam, which he sinned and made Israel to sin.”\\n17 Then Jeroboam’s wife arose and departed and came to Tirzah. And as she came to the threshold of the house, the child died.\\n18 And all Israel buried him and mourned for him, according to the word of the Lord, which he spoke by his servant Ahijah the prophet.\\nThe Death of Jeroboam19 Now the rest of the acts of Jeroboam, how he warred and how he reigned, behold, they are written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Israel.\\n20 And the time that Jeroboam reigned was twenty-two years. And he slept with his fathers, and Nadab his son reigned in his place.\\nRehoboam Reigns in Judah21 Now Rehoboam the son of Solomon reigned in Judah. Rehoboam was forty-one years old when he began to reign, and he reigned seventeen years in Jerusalem, the city that the Lord had chosen out of all the tribes of Israel, to put his name there. His mother’s name was Naamah the Ammonite.\\n22 And Judah did what was evil in the sight of the Lord, and they provoked him to jealousy with their sins that they committed, more than all that their fathers had done.\\n23 For they also built for themselves high places and pillars and Asherim on every high hill and under every green tree,\\n24 and there were also male cult prostitutes in the land. They did according to all the abominations of the nations that the Lord drove out before the people of Israel.\\n25 In the fifth year of King Rehoboam, Shishak king of Egypt came up against Jerusalem.\\n26 He took away the treasures of the house of the Lord and the treasures of the king’s house. He took away everything. He also took away all the shields of gold that Solomon had made,\\n27 and King Rehoboam made in their place shields of bronze, and committed them to the hands of the officers of the guard, who kept the door of the king’s house.\\n28 And as often as the king went into the house of the Lord, the guard carried them and brought them back to the guardroom.\\n29 Now the rest of the acts of Rehoboam and all that he did, are they not written in the Book of the Chronicles of the Kings of Judah?\\n30 And there was war between Rehoboam and Jeroboam continually.\\n31 And Rehoboam slept with his fathers and was buried with his fathers in the city of David. His mother’s name was Naamah the Ammonite. And Abijam his son reigned in his place.\\n« Proverbs 29 | Proverbs 30 | Proverbs 31 »\\nThe Words of Agur 30:1 The words of Agur son of Jakeh.

       " {'text': 'What is PAGA?\\nThe Private Attorneys General Act (PAGA) allows aggrieved employees to bring claims on behalf of themselves, other employees, and the State of California.1 Over the last 15 years, more than 35,000 PAGA notices have been sent to employers.2\\nPAGA fines can be significant. Two years ago, Walmart received a $102 million verdict in federal court after defending against a PAGA claim regarding wage statements that did not include overtime calculations.3 In order to avoid the potential for a significant judgment, many small and medium-sized employers settle out of court.\\nPAGA claims are often initiated when a terminated employee reaches out to an attorney. The attorney may ask to see the employee’s pay stubs and might find a mistake in the name or address of the employer. The error is considered a violation of the state’s labor code, and the attorney can proceed with PAGA claims. The attorney will be permitted to seek relief not just for the employee who initially reached out, but also for other employees regardless of whether they would like to participate in PAGA litigation. The attorney may use the discovery process to increase the cost of the litigation, putting pressure on the company to reach a settlement.\\nSeventy-five percent of any settlement or judgment in a PAGA case is distributed to the Labor and Workforce Development Agency (LWDA), while the other 25 percent is provided to the aggrieved employees.4 The attorneys who represent the aggrieved employees typically request one-third of the amount recovered. Thus, a PAGA settlement for three hundred thousand dollars will typically result in the attorneys receiving one hundred thousand dollars, the LWDA receiving one hundred fifty thousand dollars, and the employees receiving just fifty thousand dollars. Under this scenario, the attorneys representing the aggrieved employees recover twice as much as their clients. Some businesses have pushed for PAGA to be eliminated or scaled back in California.5\\nWho Is Considered an “Aggrieved Employee”?\\nOnly an aggrieved employee has standing to sue an employer under PAGA.6 An aggrieved employee is “any person who was employed by the alleged violator and against whom one or more of the alleged violations was committed.7”\\nEmployees sometimes bring individual wage and hour claims in addition to PAGA claims. In the past, some employers settled the individual claims, hoping the employee would lose standing to proceed with PAGA claims. In the case of Kim v. Reins International California, Inc., the California Supreme Court held that settling individual claims while excluding PAGA claims from the settlement did not prevent the employee from later bringing PAGA claims for the same labor code violations that had been released on an individual basis.8\\nThe impact of Kim v. Reins may be somewhat reduced given that many settlement agreements do not contain a carve-out of PAGA claims in the release. Employers should consider including in settlement agreements a covenant that the former employee will not participate in or bring a class action or PAGA claim.\\nWhat Claims Can be Brought under PAGA?\\nUnder PAGA, employees can bring claims for California Labor Code violations to recover civil penalties. These penalties are separate from statutory damages that employees may recover in their individual capacity.9\\nThere are three main categories of PAGA claims:\\n- First, California Labor Code Section 2699.5 provides a list of labor code sections for which employees can bring PAGA claims. These sections include retaliation or discrimination against employees,10 failure to timely pay wages on discharge,11 failure to provide proper meal and rest breaks,12 failure to provide itemized wage statements,13 and various other labor code violations. In total, section 2699.5 identifies over 100 Labor Code violations to which PAGA applies.14\\n- Second, PAGA claims can be brought for violations of the California Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1973.15 Common examples include failure to provide a safe and healthful workplace,16 failure to provide safety devices and adopt safe practices,17 and failure to implement an effective injury prevention program.18 It is important to note that PAGA claims may also be brought in cases where employers retaliate against employees who make oral or written complaints regarding workplace safety and health.19 Additionally, PAGA claims may be brought if employers laid off or discharged an employee who refused to work in a workplace containing an occupational safety or health violation.20\\n- Finally, PAGA claims can be brought by an aggrieved employee for violations not listed in section 2699.5 or in Cal OSHA.21 This category covers a broad range of labor code violations not already mentioned, such as failure to provide paid sick days,22 willful misclassification of an employee as an independent contractor,23 and violations of labor code rules for certain special occupations (e.g., mining, lumber, door-to-door sales, and theater),24 among other violations.\\nCertain claims cannot be brought under PAGA. First, PAGA claims cannot be brought for “any violation of a posting, notice, agency reporting, or filing requirement of this code, except where the filing or reporting requirement involves mandatory payroll or workplace injury reporting.”25\\nAdditionally, PAGA “[does] not apply to the recovery of administrative and civil penalties in connection with . . . workers’ compensation law”26\\nHas the Employee Met the Notice Requirements?\\nFor civil actions alleging a violation of a labor code section listed in section 2699.5, the aggrieved employee or representative must first “give written notice by online filing with the Labor and Workforce Development Agency (LWDA) and by certified mail to the employer of the specific provisions of this code alleged to have been violated, including the facts and theories to support the alleged violation.”27 The employee must also pay a $75 filing fee.28 Likewise, an employer must pay a filing fee of $75 for any response to that notice.29\\nFor civil actions alleging Occupational Health and Safety violations, the aggrieved employee must give notice by “online filing with the Division of Occupational Safety and Health and by certified mail to the employer, with a copy to the Labor and Workforce Development Agency” of the specific provisions of the California Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1973 alleged to have been violated, including the facts and theories to support the alleged violation.30\\nLastly, for civil actions alleging a violation not listed in section 2699.5 or Cal/OSHA, the aggrieved employee or representative “shall give written notice by online filing with the Labor and Workforce Development Agency and by certified mail to the employer of the specific provisions of this code alleged to have been violated, including the facts and theories to support the alleged violation.”31 The employee must pay a $75 filing fee, and the employer must pay a $75 filing fee for any response to the notice.32\\nFor additional information on filing, see: https://www.dir.ca.gov/Private-Attorneys-General-Act/Private-Attorneys-General-Act.html\\nIf employees fail to meet the notice requirements, the court may preclude the employee from pursuing PAGA claims. In Khan v. Dunn-Edwards Corp., a former employee provided the employer’s counsel and the LWDA with notice that stated: “This correspondence shall constitute written notice under Labor Code §2699.3 of my claims against my former employer.”33 The notice did not mention any other current or former employee besides the one who provided the notice.34\\nAs a result, the court held that the employee failed to comply with the administrative requirements of PAGA.35 Because the employee failed to give fair notice of the individuals involved in the PAGA claim, the court affirmed a finding of summary judgment on the PAGA claim in favor of the employer.36\\nIn Alcantar v. Hobart Service, the court found that a written notice containing purely legal conclusions fails to meet PAGA’s notice requirements because it did not contain sufficient facts or theories.37\\nHas the Employee Exhausted Administrative Remedies?\\nBy statute, there are certain administrative requirements that must be met before an employee is allowed to bring a PAGA claim. For example, the LWDA or Division of Occupational Safety and Health must be given a chance to decide whether to investigate the matter first.\\n- For 2699.5 listed violations:\\nAfter the employee has properly given notice, the LWDA will notify the employer and aggrieved employee or representative by certified mail if it does not intend to investigate the alleged violation “within 60 calendar days of the postmark date of the notice.”38 Upon being notified by the LWDA within 60 days or if the LWDA does not provide notice within 65 days, the aggrieved employee may proceed and pursue the PAGA claim.39\\nIf the LWDA decides to investigate the alleged violation, it will notify the employer and the aggrieved employee or representative of its decision within 65 calendar days of the postmarked notice.40 Then, within 120 days of that decision, the LWDA may investigate the alleged violation and issue any appropriate citation.41 If the LWDA decides not to issue a citation, it will notify the employer and aggrieved employee within five business days by certified mail.42 Upon receiving notice that no citation will issue, the aggrieved employee may pursue a PAGA claim.43 Additionally, if the LWDA fails to give notice within the 65 calendar days or fails to give notice within the 120 days after deciding to investigate, then the aggrieved employee may likewise pursue a PAGA claim.44\\n- For Cal/OSHA:\\nAfter the employee properly gives notice for Cal/OSHA violations, the Division of Occupational Safety and Health will inspect or investigate the alleged violation based on the procedures specified in Cal. Labor Code Section 6300, et. seq.45\\nIf the division decides to issue a citation, the employee cannot bring a PAGA action.46\\nIf the division fails to issue a citation (by the end of the time specified in section 6317), and the aggrieved employee disputes that decision, the employee may challenge the decision in superior court.47\\n- For violations not listed in 2699.5 or Cal/OSHA:\\nApart from providing notice to the LWDA and the employer, there is no agency investigation that needs to take place. However, violations not listed in 2699.5 or Cal/OSHA are subject to certain cure provisions, which will be addressed later in this article.\\nStatute of Limitations\\nThe statute of limitations for PAGA claims is one year.48 Accordingly, an employee must at least file notice with the LWDA within one year after a violation occurred. For example, in Esparza v. Safeway, Inc., the plaintiffs’ PAGA claim rested on violations that occurred before June 17, 2007, so the California Court of Appeal found that the plaintiff’s PAGA claims could not be brought as of June 17, 2008.49 The plaintiffs had not asserted a PAGA claim nor filed notice with the LWDA until July 2008.50 Therefore, the court found that the PAGA claims were time-barred and could no longer be brought.51\\nTwo Main Responses to Violations\\n- Cure the violations:\\nPAGA allows employers to cure certain violations. Curing is defined as: 1) The employer abates each violation alleged by any aggrieved employee; 2) The employer is in compliance with the underlying statutes as specified in the employee’s notice, and 3) Any aggrieved employee is made whole.52 There are special cure requirements for certain violations related to itemized wage statements.53\\nViolations listed in section 2699.5 cannot be cured. Only violations not listed in section 2699.5 may be cured. Cal/OSHA violations can also be cured, but only if the Division of Occupational Safety and Health fails to investigate after being given notice.54\\n- Time to cure:\\nThe employer has 33 calendar days to cure the alleged violations, starting from the time of the postmarked notice sent by the aggrieved employee or representative.55 If the alleged violation is cured, the employer must provide written notice within that time period by certified mail to the aggrieved employee or representative and by online filing with the agency, describing the remedial actions taken.56 Once the violations have been cured within the 33 days, the aggrieved employee is not allowed to pursue a PAGA lawsuit for them.57 However, the employee may pursue PAGA claims if the violations are not cured within the 33 days.58\\nEmployers may only cure the violation or violations contained in the employee’s notice up to three times in a 12-month period, regardless of the location of the workplace.59 For violations related to the requirement that itemized wage statements list the dates of the employee’s pay period and the name and address of the legal entity, the employer may only cure the violation or violations contained in the notice once in a 12-month period, regardless of the location of the workplace.60\\nHowever, the aggrieved employee is allowed to dispute that an alleged violation has been cured with the relevant agency and then with the superior court if there is still disagreement.61\\n- Mitigate the penalties:\\nEven if violations are not subject to the cure provisions of PAGA, employers may still be able to mitigate the penalties assessed at trial by promptly correcting the alleged violations. Courts have discretion to reduce the civil penalty amount if it will prevent “an award that is unjust, arbitrary and oppressive, or confiscatory.”62\\nIn Fleming v. Covidien Inc., the court found a PAGA penalty to be unjust where “‘Defendants were not aware that the wage statements violated the law and took prompt steps to correct all violations once notified.’”63\\nCorrecting any violations promptly upon being notified is a good strategy to demonstrate at trial that lower penalties should be assessed for a PAGA claim, regardless of whether those violations can be cured by statute or not.\\nPreventing Future PAGA Claims\\nEmployers should work closely with their human resources department and legal counsel to ensure that proper processes are in place to prevent potential PAGA claims. They should also keep records of their efforts to comply with the law, such as documenting any updated policies due to legal changes, keeping records of training sessions, and preserving emails demonstrating compliance efforts.\\nThe following are some examples of preventative measures:\\n- Ensure that employees receive compliant meal and rest periods. Periodically review time records for employees and follow-up with those who are not timely taking their meal periods.\\n- Provide meal period premiums and rest period premiums when employees were not able to take compliant meal and rest breaks.\\n- Properly pay all overtime earned by employees.\\n- Ensure that employees are properly classified.\\n- Make sure that your employment policies comply with current labor laws.\\n- Consider offering severance packages to employees who were terminated or who resigned after making a complaint.\\n- If a departing employee claims they did not receive meal or rest periods, then promptly provide them with meal and rest period premiums for each shift affected.\\n- Review payroll records to ensure they show the hours worked daily by each employee, the wages paid to each employee, and the number of piece-rate units earned by and paid to employees.64 Employers must keep such records on file for at least three years.65\\n- If the employer uses a rounding policy, make sure that it complies with the law. Rounding policies for timekeeping are allowed in California but are subject to restrictions.66 In Donohue v. AMN Services, LLC, the California Supreme Court held that rounding time punches is not allowed for required meal periods.67 Employees must receive their full 30-minute meal period for every five hours worked.68\\n- Ensure that proper itemized wage statements are being provided to employees when wages are paid.69\\n- Review your workplace health and safety standards to ensure they comply with Cal/OSHA.\\nThere are additional measures that can be taken to reduce the potential for a PAGA claim to be filed.

       " {'text': 'So let’s say you’ve got some particles in 2-dimensional space.\\nThere they are. Now let’s say you want any two particles which are very close to each other to interact. You need to know which pairs are close enough. You could take all possible pairs of particles, calculate their distances, and compare those to the minimum distance\\nd. That’s fine if you have 10 particles, but if you have 5,000 that’s going to add up to over 12,000,000 pairs. That’s too many pairs.\\nThat complexity can be alleviated if for each particle\\nP we can efficiently find a subset of all particles which includes all those within\\nP and which includes as few as possible which aren’t within\\nd. Then we can calculate the distances from\\nP to the few particles in this subset and determine which ones are actually within distance\\nEnter: spatial hashing. I’ll show how\\nboost::unordered_multimap can be used to do this.\\nunordered_multimap is a key-value storage where multiple values are allowed to have the same key. Under the hood of this object is a hash table. This means that the type used for keys must have an equality operator and a hash function yielding an unsigned integer which is “very likely” to be unique.\\nSince each key in the multimap is ultimately reduced to a single integer, and what we’re trying to do is look up particles based on their positions, creating a hash function amounts to defining a mapping from continuous 2D space into discrete 1D space. A fine way to do this is to break down the continuous space by a grid and then combine the discrete grid coordinates into a single value with a generic hash function.\\nThere’s your grid. The resolution of this grid i.e. the size of the cells is not arbitrary. More on that later.\\nIt doesn’t take very much code to implement the concepts so far:\\ninline vec_2i cell ( const vec_2f & p, float cellsize )\\nreturn vec_2i( boost::math::iround<float>( p.x / cellsize ),\\nboost::math::iround<float>( p.y / cellsize ) );\\ninline size_t hash_value ( const vec_2i & v )\\nsize_t h = 0xdeadbeef;\\nboost::hash_combine( h, v.x );\\nboost::hash_combine( h, v.y );\\ntypedef boost::unordered_multimap< vec_2i, particle_t > positionhash_t;\\n- The multimap value type could instead be a pointer or it could be an array index; it’s a data structure in this case for the sake of clarity. What’s best depends on what you’re up to.\\ncellsizeis the width and height of the grid cells in continuous space. The reason for keeping the real position to grid position conversion in a separate function rather than using the real position itself as the multimap key will become apparent.\\nLet’s focus on the particle\\nP at the center of the blue circle. The circle has radius\\nd (the distance within which we want to know about other particles). If the grid cells are at least\\nd on a side then all particles within the circle will be found in the nine shaded cells (the cell containing\\nP and the eight surrounding cells). Now it becomes clear why we want to use grid coordinates as keys rather than real coordinates: the keys for neighboring cells can be determined easily by adding/subtracting 1 to/from the x and y components. So,\\ncellsize must be at least\\nd for this to be correct, but it need not be larger than\\ncellsize = d, this is what I’m getting at.\\nIn this case the subset of particles we find includes two which are within\\nd and one which is not; so we’ve got a 66% hit rate here. In general, if the particles are uniformly distributed, the hit rate of this spatial hashing process will be the circle’s area divided by the area of nine cells; with\\ncellsize = d that’s roughly 35%.\\nOK then, let’s move on to determining the neighboring pairs of particles over the entire set of particles. If you insert all particles into the multimap and then examine each particle as we just did you’ll end up calculating all distances twice, and you’ll end up with two copies of each pairing. To refine this such that we don’t run redundant calculations, don’t produce redundant pairings, and don’t use any additional data structures, we can simply intermix the processes of inserting particles in the multimap and searching for neighboring particles.\\nTo find each pair only once:\\n- Start with empty multimap\\n- For each particle\\n- Determine which cell will contain\\n- Retrieve all particles in\\nP‘s cell and the eight neighboring cells\\n- Calculate distance from\\nPto each of these and compare to\\n- Determine which cell will contain\\nThe code would look a little something like this:\\nvec_2i offsets[ 9 ];\\nfor( int dx = -1; dx <= 1; ++dx )\\nfor( int dy = -1; dy <= 1; ++dy )\\noffsets[ (dx+1) + 3 * (dy+1) ] = vec_2i( dx, dy );\\nBOOST_FOREACH( const particle_t & P, particles )\\nfor( size_t oi = 0; oi < 9; ++oi )\\nstd::pair< positionhash_t::const_iterator, positionhash_t::const_iterator >\\nr = positionhash.equal_range( cell(P.pos, d) + offsets[oi] );\\nfor( positionhash_t::const_iterator n = r.first; n != r.second; ++n )\\n// if distance from P to n->second is less than d:\\n// note P and n->second as a neighboring pair\\npositionhash.insert( positionhash_t::value_type( cell(P.pos, d), P ) );\\nAnd there you have it. I applied this technique in a toy particle simulation, and I was able to go from simulating around 300 particles to simulating 7,000 or more. Because the asymptotic complexities are different, the difference in efficiency between this spatial hashing approach and the naive quadratic approach grows larger as the number of particles increases.\\nI have not tried applying this to 3 dimensions, and I have no plans to. It would not be difficult to adapt, but cost would increase:\\n- Real positions would have three components as would the grid positions. Hashing would be 150% as complex.\\n- Instead of 8 neighboring cells, there would be 26. Querying for potential neighboring particles would be 300% as complex.\\n- For uniformly distributed particles, hit rate would drop more than half. Testing potential neighboring particles would be at least 225% as complex.',\n",

       " {'text': '5.9k Share this\\nHouse Democrats slammed oil and gas industry executives during a hearing on Wednesday, accusing them of profiteering amid Russia’s invasion of Ukraine and its impact on the global energy market.\\nThe consensus among committee Democrats and Republicans, as well as the executives who testified, is that the U.S. needs to boost domestic production in the short term in order to provide Americans relief at the pump. Where they fiercely disagree is on the barriers keeping that from happening.\\nRep. Diana DeGette (D-Colo.), chair of the House Energy and Commerce Oversight and Investigations subcommittee, displayed a chart showing that while the price of crude oil has dropped in recent weeks, gasoline prices in the U.S. remain near historic highs.\\n“Why?” she asked. “If the price of gas is driven by the global market, why is the price of oil coming down but the price at the pump is still at record highs?”\\n“Something just doesn’t add up,” she added.\\nIndustry executives from Exxon Mobil, BP, Chevron, Shell USA, Devon Energy Corp and Pioneer Resources said the global market controls prices, not individual companies, but struggled to explain the widening gap.\\n“Changes in the price of crude oil do not always result in immediate changes at the pump,” said Mike Wirth, CEO of Chevron. He added that “it frequently takes more time for competition among retail stations to bring prices back down.”\\n“It is a very complex set of factors that impact the price of gasoline,” including supply risk across all fossil fuel products, said David Lawler, president of BP America.\\nRepublicans on the committee ran to the industry’s defense. Reps. Morgan Griffith (Va.) and Cathy McMorris Rodgers (Wash.) argued that the Biden administration’s “anti-American energy agenda” and “war” on fossil fuels are to blame for inflated prices.\\n“It is impossible to generate confidence or invest in production today when future production is clearly being blocked by this administration,” Griffith said.\\nGriffith asked each of the executives if their company was “taking advantage of the crisis in Ukraine to keep prices artificially high in order to increase your own profits?” All of them said they were not.\\n“We have no tolerance for price-gouging,” Wirth, of Chevron, said in his opening remarks.\\nBut as DeGette and other Democrats on the panel pointed out, and as the executives acknowledged, the industry is raking in record profits. The six companies present Wednesday brought in a combined $75 billion in profits last year. And when the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas surveyed 139 industry executives last month, the majority — 59% — cited investor pressure as the main reason producers have not ramped up production.\\nRep. Frank Pallone (D-N.J.), chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said the industry is “ripping off the American people.”\\n“At a time of record profits, big oil is refusing to increase production to provide the American people some much-needed relief at the gas pump. Instead, they are buying back their stock at an estimated $40 billion this year. Big oil is lining their pockets with one hand and taking millions in taxpayer subsidies with the other.”\\nStock buybacks are when a company uses its profits to buy up its own stock, often leading to a surge in the stock price. Pallone asked each of the executives if they would commit to reducing stock buybacks and dividends for shareholders, which would enable them to increase production instead amid ongoing turmoil in the energy market. None of them said they would.\\n“I can’t commit to a reduction in buybacks,” Lawler said.\\nMonday’s hearing and U.S. lawmakers’ push for more fossil fuel development come against the backdrop of a new United Nations report that warns global carbon emissions need to peak by 2025, then go down 43% by 2030, in order to prevent catastrophic planetary warming.\\nLast week, Biden ordered the largest-ever release of oil from the nation’s strategic reserves — an average of 1 million barrels per day for six months — to combat high prices and act as a “wartime bridge” until domestic production can ramp up later this year. He also called on Congress to pass “use it or lose it” legislation requiring oil and gas companies to pay fees on idle wells and unused federal leases.\\nHighlighting the tightrope that Democrats are walking on energy ahead of the midterms later this year, when gas prices are likely to be high on voters’ minds, Pallone called on industry executives to “take some action to reduce the pain at the gas pump.”\\n“Produce more oil,” he said on Wednesday. “Produce more with the wells you have.”\\nSource: Huff Post',\n",

       " {'text': 'Now, today is the last of the 30 day challenge, looking at a whole variety of themes that can make a difference to the quality of your life. Today’s theme is about being right. Now, being right and being determined to be right can actually end up costing you more than you think. I want you to consider how often it is that you are involved in a discussion or an argument where you know you are right; where you have an absolute understanding of the facts and the situation, but the other person equally has a feeling that they are right too.\\nWhat do you do when you have lots to do but don\\'t feel like doing it? How often do you get frustrated when things don\\'t work as you would like or quickly enough? Do you give up Or dig deep?\\nHi, it’s Gina Gardiner here, and today is the 28th day of the 30 day challenge. I am an international best-selling author, I am an empowerment and relationship coach, and I do strategic transformational leadership training and coaching. At the heart of everything I do is empowerment, and today I want to talk to you about the whole issues about dealing with difficult people. I suspect that every single one of us deals with people we find a challenge. And difficult people can come from family, friends, colleagues; they’re around.\\nRobert Frost said \"Two roads diverged in a wood and I - I took the one less travelled by, and that has made all the difference.\" Have you ever asked yourself, \"What road am I travelling on - where will it lead?\"\\nHi there, my name is Gina Gardiner, and today I’d like to talk to you about setting positive intentions. Success often feels like it is something difficult to achieve and sustain, and there are actually lots of ways you can help yourself. One of those ways is to be very clear about what are the positive intentions in what you want to do? What is your ‘why’?\\nGiving people a second chance - what do you think? When and how often should you give someone a second chance?\\nFriendship - What does it mean to you? Friendships are very precious. There is an old saying \"You can\\'t choose your family but you can choose your friends.\"\\nThey say laughter is the best medicine - when was the last time you laughed until you cried? Humour can lighten up not only your day but make the most challenging situations feel more manageable. Laughter relieves stress and brings light and a sense of possibility to the situation.\\nBoundaries - are you able to create appropriate boundaries for yourself, with others - personally and professionally? Why is it so many people find it so difficult to create and maintain effective boundaries?',\n",

       " {'text': 'New Findings: What is the central question of this study? Does exercise training impact resting and postexercise cardiac troponin T (cTnT) concentration? What is the main finding and its importance? This randomized controlled intervention study demonstrated that 12 weeks of either high-intensity interval training or moderate-intensity continuous training largely abolished the exercise-induced elevation in cTnT when exercise was performed at the same absolute intensity. There was no impact of training on resting cTnT or postexercise appearance of cTnT when exercise was performed at the same relative intensity. These findings provide new information that might help clinicians with decision-making in relationship to basal and postexercise values of cTnT in individuals with different training status. Abstract: We evaluated the influence of 12 weeks of high-intensity interval training [HIIT; repeated 4 min cycling at 90% of maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) interspersed with 3 min rest, 200–300 kJ per session, 3 or 4 days each week] and work-equivalent moderate-intensity continuous training (MICT; continuous cycling at 60% (VO2max) on resting cardiac troponin T (cTnT) and the appearance of exercise-induced cTnT. Forty-eight sedentary obese young women were randomly assigned to HIIT, MICT or a control group. The (VO2max) and body composition were measured before and after training. At baseline, cTnT was assessed using a high-sensitivity assay at rest and immediately, 2 and 4 h after 45 min cycling at 60% (VO2max). After a 12 week training period, cTnT was assessed before and after 45 min cycling at the same relative and absolute intensities as before training. Training led to higher (VO2max) and lower fat mass in both HIIT and MICT groups (all P < 0.05). Before training, cTnT was significantly elevated in all three groups (by 35–118%, all P < 0.05) with acute exercise. After training, both resting and postexercise cTnT concentrations (same relative intensity) were similar to pretraining values. In contrast, postexercise cTnT (same absolute intensity, which represented a smaller exercise stimulus) was not elevated from rest in both HIIT and MICT groups. In conclusion, 12 weeks of either HIIT or MICT largely abolished the postexercise elevation of cTnT concentration when exercise was performed at the same absolute intensity. There was, however, no impact of training on resting cTnT or postexercise appearance of cTnT for exercise performed at the same relative intensity.\\nScopus Subject Areas\\n- Nutrition and Dietetics\\n- Physiology (medical)\\n- cardiac biomarker\\n- high-intensity interval training\\n- moderate-intensity continuous training',\n",

       " {'text': 'January 1, 2020 is the second “official” anniversary of the Midwest Alliance for Mindfulness (MAM), Kansas City’s premier secular mindfulness and meditation center. Though we breathed ourselves into life a number of years ago, we are gratefully marking two years as a business entity (see our year 1 post here). It’s so incredible to me when I look back at all we’ve experienced together. We’ve grown to a team of 13 trained mindfulness teachers and a community of over 100 members. Over the last two years we’ve taught over 400 people though our 600+ offerings. We’ve fully inhabited our own space and are just finding our groove.\\nIn order to inspire a revolution from the inside out and contribute to changing the world for the better, we’ve had to be willing to take some risks. We believe mindfulness is not just a mental exercise, but a way of engaging in our lives and with our communities in a manner that’s in alignment with our deepest values. In 2019 we created offerings mindfully exploring consumerism, social activism, implicit bias, trauma, addictions, identity issues, diversity, equity and inclusion, radical compassion, and forgiveness. These are tender subjects confronting the causes of some of humanity’s most painful personal and social suffering. Offering these programs challenges the feel good message that is often used to “sell” mindfulness, yet our community has responded with an openness and willingness that touches our hearts. Here is a summary of some of the innovative efforts we initiated during our second year:\\n- Designed and filled a Mindfulness Teacher Training Certificate Program – the first of its kind in our area.\\n- Spearheaded the Mindful Kansas City initiative to nurture a kinder gentler community.\\n- Created and/or road tested many new classes and services such as the iRest Yoga Nidra, Inner Revolutionaries, Mindful Attitude Adjustment, Acceptance & Commitment Training (ACT) for all manner of things, Recovery Friendly Ashtanga Yoga, & Qigong.\\n- Debuted several affinity group mindfulness practice opportunities such as the Community of Color, LGBTQIA+ and First Responders practice communities.\\n- Made mindfulness training available in Spanish.\\n- Offered charitable donations, pro-bono services and strategic partnerships in collaboration with a number of philanthropic and civic-minded organizations.\\n- Launched a corporate campaign.\\nThere has definitely been a learning curve to this unique endeavor. We are so thankful that our members and participants have been patient, gracious and flexible as we work thought this experimental stage, finding out what is of interest to folks and what days, times, and seasons of year work best. At times we’ve had to cancel classes due to under-enrollment and at other times we’ve had to purchase additional equipment to meet high demand. Our own mindfulness practice has been invaluable during these times, helping us to find equanimity amidst the unpredictability.\\nOur greatest asset by far is this amazing community of people we’ve cultivated from all walks of life, practicing together toward greater compassion, peace and wellbeing. My heart swells every time I hear about what a kind and welcoming group of human beings gather in our space. Sharing the calm, soulful energy of the practice room during our Thursday evening Mindfulness Community Practice Meetings is something special to experience. I love to watch folks linger in the atrium to talk or make plans – I imagine that new connections are forming and some of the loneliness in the world is decreasing.\\nCome celebrate with us during our 2nd MAMiversay event Friday January 31, 2020 from 5:30 pm – 7:30 pm – please RSVP here so we know how much cake we need 🎂\\nWe have worked hard to keep our fees low so we can reach people from the spectrum of socioeconomic situations. Those who are able to pay more make it possible for us to serve others who have less. Most of our teachers have full time jobs that pay their bills, some have children, and some are primary earners for their families. One of our teachers is legally blind and must hire transportation to and from the center. All have invested much time, effort and money in their own training and continuing education. We have had to make some difficult choices and set some boundaries with this delicate symbiotic balance in mind. Fortunately, we have begun to be able to provide some remuneration for our teachers’ services and give back to the community through donations and pro bono services while keeping our costs for our memberships and classes reasonable. We are especially grateful to our members who provide a regular stream of revenue that we can count on for our operations.\\nSometimes people ask why we would do this strange, crazy and beautiful thing. For most of us it’s a calling, maybe even a compulsion, sharing these practices that have been so healing and dear to us with others. Perhaps the best way to answer the question is with this poem – one of my very favorites:\\nThere’s a thread you follow. It goes among\\nthings that change. But it doesn’t change.\\nPeople wonder about what you are pursuing.\\nYou have to explain about the thread.\\nBut it is hard for others to see.\\nWhile you hold it you can’t get lost.\\nTragedies happen; people get hurt\\nor die; and you suffer and get old.\\nNothing you do can stop time’s unfolding.\\nYou don’t ever let go of the thread.\\n– William Stafford, The Way It Is',\n",

       " {'text': 'Thinking about becoming a franchisee? Excited about the opportunities out there but overwhelmed with what you need to know? Here’s the next part in our series of informational posts about how franchising works.\\nIn this blog post, Mari Fellrath, Vice President of Business Intelligence, shares how Great Clips uses technology to help franchisees run and grow their walk-in hair care salons.\\nGreat Clips is the high-tech leader in our industry. Why are we so focused on technology in a traditionally high-touch, low-tech industry? It’s how we differentiate Great Clips from the competition in the eyes of the customers with tech tools that save them time (I’ll talk more about our customer-facing technology in another post).\\nAnd, it’s how we help our franchisees manage and grow their businesses through a continual evolution of technological tools and resources that help them evaluate, monitor and report what’s going on in their organization.\\nThe key tools they use to do that are Spectrum, Styleware (our proprietary point-of-sale (POS) system) and Styleware Vantage.\\nSpectrum is a web-based business intelligence tool that allows franchisees and general managers to view data on their organization’s performance, across all their salons. Right now we’re able to provide data and reports, and we’re developing it into an even richer resource with dashboards and data views that provide performance comparisons and benchmarks, trends and actionable information.\\nOur POS system, developed by our long-term vendor partner, Innovative Computer Software (ICS), is more focused on the day-to-day management of each salon. All of our salons are on the POS system – which is customized and proprietary to Great Clips – which allows us to work with ICS to develop functionality and reporting that is specific to our needs. The POS does track customer profile and transactional data, and includes a powerful scheduling tool, inventory management system, numerous reports, and other functionality.\\nStyleware Vantage is another ICS product. It is an iPad app that displays salon data in real time. A franchisee or general manager can pull up the app and see all of their salon locations on a map, along with key operational data that is updated in real-time. This tool is useful because it provides a real-time look into what is happening in the salon; for example, when the salon opened that day, who is working, how many customers are in the salon, the average haircut time, what the product sales are for the day, whether the salon is trending for a record week—and more!\\nThis technology is also useful to the home office team who can use the business intelligence to analyze gaps in performance and develop tools and services to help the salon teams deliver better customer service. This is especially true when we see a place where we can simplify a process that will improve efficiency and customer service.\\nWhenever we develop new tools or make enhancements, we gather a lot of user feedback from franchisees and those who are actually using these tools. We often work with them on task forces and spend a lot of time taking their input. It’s a real collaborative effort.\\nOur goal is to make sure we are using technology in ways that complement our business—not just technology for the sake of technology. We use and embrace technology when it supports brand delivery and growth, and improves the experience for our franchisees, their salon teams and their customers.\\nNext in this series: Mari will explain how Great Clips uses technology to help customers save time.',\n",

       " {'text': \"I mentally organize my cooperative games by how much investment they require. Left 4 Dead can be played on autopilot, a casual hangout with friends through the apocalypse. Destiny raids, on the other hand, can require extreme coordination. I love both styles of co-op but I don't know quite what to do with Trident’s Wake (opens in new tab), which feels stuck in a limbo between the two extremes. It occasionally shows you bits of depth and difficulty that go underused, at least so far in Early Access.\\nDeveloper Bacus Studios isn’t shy about Trident’s biggest inspiration: Helldivers. Both are twin stick shooters with a focus on four player co-op, procedural level generation, ammo scarcity, and alien murder. But whereas Helldivers’ battlefields are sprawling planet surfaces, Trident’s battles are fought in the dark, claustrophobic hallways of a desolate spaceship.\\nTrident’s Wake is light on story at the moment, but Bacus gave me the gist: After a cataclysmic event wipes out most life on Earth, the survivors retreat to the last human colony ship, the Trident, to survive. When they arrive, they find it overrun by hostile aliens. The humans deploy AI “sentinels” to take back the ship—aka me and you.\\nThe current Early Access build has three zones: the industrial complex, tech labs, and crew quarters. The level select map shows room for at least six or seven additional areas. The areas look nice, but there’s a noticeable lack of variety in the industrial and lab zones. Besides some minor interior differences, they feel like the same interchangeable dark hallways with computer consoles and big machinery. The crew quarters’ colorful foliage and well-lit rooms are a welcome relief to the dreariness. Unfortunately, the level layouts don’t meaningfully change with a new zone. Every mission is a procedural smattering of square rooms connected by hallways with seemingly random enemy placement. It works, but it gets boring fast.\\nMission variety is also an issue. As you’re loaded into a mission you’re automatically assigned four random tasks to complete before extraction. Even though the tasks range from shutting down a security system to downloading data from a terminal, they’re all mostly accomplished by approaching a terminal and pressing E. There’s no story, briefing, or explanation of any kind before loading into a mission. You’re just there, and you have to press E on stuff.\\nOne bit of genuine suspense comes when you activate the elevator finale at the end of a mission and must survive a huge wave of baddies before the door opens. Trident’s Wake clearly wants every moment of a mission to crackle with that sense of danger and survival, but that just doesn't happen. The simple mission design is too easily manipulated to force those moments of tension—most tasks are completed as soon as you interact with the right console, so you can just sprint through the level avoiding enemies. Trident's Wake needs more involved objectives to give you a reason to stick around and fight.(opens in new tab)\\nRoll the dice\\nBut when you're fighting, Trident's Wake is a fun time. Weapons cover a diverse range of loadouts. I spent most of my time with the trusty assault rifle and filled my secondary slot with something more situational like the beam rifle, minigun, or flamethrower for big crowds. The sentinels feel agile and control well with mouse and keyboard. Sprinting is a reliable way to crowd control a crammed arena of explosive enemies trying to rush you. The dash ability is handy for dodging incoming fire. Weapons generally feel punchy and balanced, but a few gun sounds are a bit generic and don't have the impact they feel like they should.\\nTrident’s Wake brings a fun twist to building a loadout thanks to its in-depth customization. Completing missions nets weapon parts and a resource called Metheria, which are used to upgrade or “recalibrate” weapons. Upgrading a weapon to a higher tier enormously improves its performance across the board, while recalibration is a much less expensive option that rerolls the weapon’s stats (damage, fire rate, clip size, etc) to hopefully create a better version. Upgrading a weapon’s tier requires rare weapons parts earned from completing missions. I never wanted to grind for them, since every mission feels more or less the same.\\nIt’s kind of addicting to continuously reroll my assault rifle stats. It pings the same part of my monkey brain that gets a rush from opening loot boxes. There are no real money stakes to recalibration, thankfully, but a bad roll of stats and wasted currency faithfully emulates the empty feeling of pulling a slot machine lever and getting squat. One more try and I'll surely hit the jackpot.\\nBacus hopes that recalibration will make every player’s weapon feel unique, but ultimately the differences here are minor. It’s hard to imagine a friend would ever notice that my flamethrower is doing slightly more damage while theirs has to reload slightly less often. It’s a cool concept, but the potential gains aren't worth it, from my experience. You’re better off banking currency until you can upgrade a weapon’s tier for a guaranteed improvement.(opens in new tab)\\nThere is some strategy to deciding which sentinel to play as, but they again suffer from Trident’s problem of not going deep enough. Some sentinels have higher shields or can dash more between cooldowns, and each has a signature skill. The skills are mostly little backup attacks or buffs like Overclock, which increases the damage of your whole team for a time. The Shield Nova has the most interesting give/take of sacrificing the rest of your shield to unleash a burst of damage around you. The unlockable Tzar sentinel seems to have the objectively best ability at the moment, unleashing a rocket barrage for huge damage with a modest cooldown. It’d be nice to see more interactivity between the abilities so team composition feels like an important decision rather than a matter of preference.\\nSimilar to Helldivers, Trident’s difficulty comes from a scarcity of health and ammo. Helldivers has a clever mechanic that forces players to take a moment of vulnerability to call in a resource airdrop, which actually forces you to punch in the correct command in the heat of the moment. In Trident, healing and stocking up are simplified so that all players have health or ammo pickups they can drop for the team at any time. This severely undercuts the reason for ammo scarcity in the first place. Having the ability to drop health kits on a short cooldown feels arbitrary and kills the tension of harder fights.\\nA lot of my complaints could be remedied in Early Access—Trident's Wake hasn't been out for long and is still missing many of its planned features. Health and ammo are the only secondary gear right now while ability upgrades and additional sentinels are listed as coming soon. Trident's Wake needs to give me more reasons to care about my loadout, and its missions need to give me a reason to fight, rather than just running past enemies for an easy, boring win. Bacus clearly has much larger aspirations for Trident’s Wake, but what’s there now is hard to recommend.\",\n",

       " {'text': \"Unwrapping Bridgerton Looks: 6 Ways to Do Beauty Like Royalty\\nFancy yourself a Regency royal? Check out these Bridgerton looks for tips on how to incorporate their trends into your routine.\\nThe standards of the Regency beauty were perfectly spelled out in the racy, period TV series Bridgerton. Characterized by the glaring shift from elaborate, over-the-top style to softer, more natural features, the era is a period of beauty in transition fitting for the age of refinement. In the show, this progression is depicted through the stark contrast between the styles of the young and mature royals. These Bridgerton looks make us wonder: how exactly do they pull it off? Here are six ways you can do beauty like royalty.\\nMassive Dos Are Massive ‘Dos\\nSure, sky-high hairdos and wigs were on their way out, but that didn’t stop Queen Charlotte, played by Golda Rosheuvel, from blessing us with her outrageous Bridgerton looks. The Queen does what she wants, and in the photo is one of her most elaborate headpieces to date.\\nIf you want to do hair like Regency royalty in the 21st century, one way to do so is by wearing it up into near-sculptural buns, ponytails, and curls. In the show, she wears a wig. However, if you’re using your own hair, make sure to use strengthening products to make it resilient to the\\nPale, Delicate Skin Was In\\nEmphasis on “was.” Season 2 Bridgerton looks are showing more diversity among the cast. But you didn’t need to know that you can rock these looks whatever your skin color. Instead, focus on luminous, dewy skin. Dry cracked hands? Simply intolerable. You can achieve this healthy glowing skin, first and foremost, by staying out of the sun and wearing sunscreen. Ultraviolet rays can cause moisture to evaporate from your epidermis, dulling your dewy glow.\\nOn your body, apply Vaseline Gluta-Hya Serum Burst Dewy Radiance all over to even out your skin tone. Don't forget your hands, elbows, and neck — the most common locations to develop skin discoloration.\\nRichly Colored Locks\\nWhether it’s a deep caramel, a radiant blonde, or a fiery red, hair color definitely makes an impact in the Bridgerton world. To look like a royal, make sure your hair color is always in tip-top shape. If you’re , follow the instructions precisely. Take care of your colored locks by moisturizing them daily with a conditioner for colored hair.\\nTo prevent dryness and damage, use a deep conditioning mask once a week. Finally, when your roots start to peek out at the end of the month, spray them with TRESemmé Root Touch-up Spray, which comes in three variants, Black, Dark Brown, and Light Brown.\\nMini Bangs (But Tread Lightly)\\nThe Bridgerton sisters may have starkly different personalities, but they do share a love for baby bangs. Daphne’s baby bangs and how they evolved throughout the first season were symbolic of her coming of age. So, maybe, the case is the same for her feisty little sister Eloise? Only time will tell. Meanwhile, if you’re going to try bangs, go with less drastic to ease you into the style.\\nBring Your RBF\\nGiven that world of Bridgerton is full of scheming and intrigue, best to bring your best RBF to ward off the busybodies. The perfect accessory to match bejeweled gowns and crows, the RBF is something you should own and celebrate. Ignore the stigma — you don’t have to smile if you don’t want to.\\nAccording to a study by the University of California, women with RBF are better at communicating and expressing emotions because they’ve had to work extra hard at it their entire lives. So, ahead, smirk like the Queen, it’ll get your everywhere.\\nEmpire Waist All the Way\\nEmpire-cut dresses... what’s not to love? While mostly deemed unflattering in modern fashion, empire-cut, also known as empire-waist dresses are one of the most prominent Bridgerton looks. With their origins in Greek art and fashion, empire dresses are lighter and more comfortable than their corseted counterparts and were worn in warmer climates. The raised waistline denoted a high status in the era; plus, the lighter the fabric, the wealthier the wearer.\\nFeel even cooler when you use Dove 0% Aluminum Deodorant Roll-On, which protects you from sweat and odor with a refreshing cucumber and green tea scent.\\nDrawn to Bridgerton looks? Start with the baby steps above to incorporate some Regency beauty trends into your routine.\",\n",

       " {'text': '| Loans: Introduction to Loans... |\\nby Jonathan Lammers\\nWith so many financing choices available today, it\\'s easier than ever to find a home loan that meets both your budget and future plans. But before you sign on the dotted line, it pays to be familiar with some of the most common types of loans. You should also get advice from your real estate agent and speak with several lenders about your options.\\n| Summary Points |\\n|1. || Learn more about your financing options by getting advice from your agent and speaking with several lenders. |\\n|2. || Use your budget and how long you plan to stay in the home as helpful guides. |\\n|3. || Consider a government loan program if you need help qualifying for a loan. |\\nFixed-rate mortgages carry the same interest rate for the life of the loan. These types of loans have traditionally been the most popular choice for homeowners because their steady payments are easy to budget for, and can help protect against inflation. Fixed-rate mortgages are most common in 30-year and 15-year terms, but may also be available for 20-year and 40-year mortgages.\\nAdjustable-rate mortgages (or ARMs) are the most widely accepted alternative to fixed-rate mortgages. The primary difference is that the interest rate and monthly payment can change over the life of the loan. This is because the interest rate for an ARM is tied to an index (such as Treasury Securities) that may rise or fall over time. To protect homebuyers from dramatic rate increases, most ARM loans have \"caps\" that limit the rate from rising above a certain amount between adjustments (e.g. no more than 2 percent a year), as well as a \"ceiling\" on increases over the life of the loan (e.g. no more than 6 percent).\\nHybrid loans get their name because they combine features of both fixed-rate and adjustable-rate mortgages. For example, a typical hybrid loan may start with a fixed-rate loan for several years, and later convert to an adjustable-rate mortgage. (Some hybrid loans do not have interest rate caps for the first adjustment period, so be sure to check with the lender). Another type of hybrid loan may start with a low introductory fixed interest rate, and then change to another (usually higher) fixed interest rate for the remainder of the loan term.\\nUsing Time Wisely\\nThe length of time you plan to live in a house should be an important factor in your choice of financing. If you plan to stay for 10 years or longer, a traditional fixed-rate mortgage may be your best bet. But if you plan on owning a home for less than 5 years, then the low introductory rate of an adjustable-rate mortgage or hybrid loan might make the most financial sense. In general, ARMs have the lowest introductory interest rates, followed by hybrid loans, and then traditional fixed-rate mortgages.\\n| Loan Comparison || Pros || Cons || Time Factor |\\n| Fixed-Rate Loans || Steady payments, easy budgeting. May protect against inflation || Can be costly to refinance if interest rates drop. || Attractive if you plan to stay in the house for many years |\\n| Adjustable-Rate Loans || May be easier to qualify for. Payments can drop with interest rates || Payments vary over time and may rise substantially with interest rates. || Consider if you plan to stay in the house for only a few years. |\\n| Hybrid Loans || Often have low introductory rates; flexibility || May not have adjustment cap. Payments can rise over time. || Can work well if you only plan to stay in house for a short time. |\\nF.H.A. and V.A. Loans\\nIf you find it difficult to qualify for a conventional loan, U.S. government loan programs from the Federal Housing Authority (F.H.A.) or the Department of Veterans Affairs (V.A.) may be helpful. Designed to promote home ownership by offering lower qualifying ratios and reduced down payments, F.H.A. and V.A. loans are not issued by the government, but instead are made by private lenders who are protected by government insurance in case the borrower defaults. Unlike conventional loans, both F.H.A. and V.A. loans have maximum allowable amounts and may require additional paperwork and inspections before the loan can be approved.',\n",

       " {'text': 'By SKC Ogbonnia\\nUnlike my father, my mother Esther Oligwe Ogbonnia hardly cares who wins or who loses in presidential politics so far there is peace. Not in 2015!\\nFull of excitement following Muhammadu Buhari’s victory, I placed a call to my mother in Nigeria, but she was not her usual cheerful self.\\nSKC (Me): “Mama, why are you sounding strange?”\\nMother: “Hmmm…I am okay but not very okay. There is trouble. The problem seems to be your friend—the Hausa man. They say the man has become the president again by force and plans to take away our Bible. They also say he is the same person who caused us harm during the war, and is going to replace all our people in government work with Hausa.”\\nSKC: “Who is saying all those things about Buhari? When did you become a politician?”\\nMother: “Well, I am not a politician. And I may never have crossed River Niger or know how to count 1.2.3, but I can smell counterfeit from a distance. My son, the fear of that man is rearing up everywhere—in the church, our meetings, and the marketplace. Even our ‘who is who’ in the North have already packed back to Enugu . I pray this aura of doom will not be felt where you are in America ...”\\nSKC: “Mama, please do not mind them. I am very happy to have supported the man. As I told you before, he is better than Jonathan by far. He will end corruption and provide jobs for our youths. Kidnapping and armed robbery will go away. Those saying bad things about Buhari are some of the same people who stole the money meant to complete Ugbo road. They are afraid he will put them in prison. That is why”\\nMother: “So the Buhari man is truly a good person? But did you hear that he locked up Jim Nwobodo and one good man from Onitsha area for no just cause? Do you know they also say that he killed one young boy from Udi Agbaja for nothing? Biko, how did you know the man?”\\nSKC: No, I did not know Buhari before. However, when he was head of state, there was no corruption. Watch…things will change within few months. NEPA will provide light day and night… You will say, I told you so.”\\nMother: “Well, I have heard you, my son. So, we should not worry? I am feeling better now, but I don’t know about our people. They see the man as danger…”\\nClearly, the general perception of Muhammadu Buhari in the East before the election was that of a jihadist, dictator, and a bigot—all roped in one, thanks to a montage of propaganda orchestrated by the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP). The then ruling party did everything humanly possible to cling on to power. And you can’t blame them. Having squandered our common wealth while at the helm, PDP had nothing on the ground for the Igbo masses and thus needed to sustain mass following by deceit.\\nFor example, one infantile lie drummed since 2011 to prevent the restless Igbo youths from revolt had been that “Things will get better once President Goodluck Jonathan zones presidency to the Igbos after his tenure.” It was not surprising, therefore, that Buhari’s victory was readily seen as a coup d’état in the East, particularly among the jobless youths, who thence seem to have nowhere else to perch than clench their angst towards one form of Biafra or another.\\nThe gist, if it is not already manifest, is that these new Biafrans, most of who are under the aegis of PDP Youth Wing, are the byproduct of the party’s gloomy narratives of Buhari. In fact, any careful review of the recent activities of Nnamdi Kanu, the leader of the Indigenous People of Biafra (IPOB), leaves no one in doubt that his rebellion was heightened by the defeat of Jonathan and PDP. And it does not take a genius to discern why prominent opposition leaders from the East have continued to tiptoe around the Biafran agitation even when it has widened.\\nFor sure, the rallying cry for the current Biafran movement is the inexplicable marginalization of the Igbos. But we must not ignore one bitter truth: The last 16 years of democratic rule did not take place under Muhammadu Buhari or the All Progressive Congress (APC)—but squarely under PDP where every ethnic group, including the Igbos and their Southern neighbors were well represented.\\nYet both President Buhari and APC have not helped matters. Upon assuming office, Buhari’s body language, including lopsided political appointments, began to appear as if the old Eastern Region was an illegal alien. To add salt to an open injury, the president shocked the democratic world by stoking a statement generally interpreted as a plot to marginalize the zones that gave him fewer votes. This gaffe was definitely beyond the pale and had deserved every damage control.\\nSadly, instead of telling the president the simple truth, many APC leaders went as far lampooning the Igbos for expressing their right to choose. The ruling party conveniently brushed aside the fact that virtually all Nigerian presidential elections in history were influenced by ethnic sentiments, yet there is no record where a section of the country was denied its share of the national cake on the basis of voting pattern. The whole APC approach on political appointments triggered a nationwide outrage, with many groups charging the new government of ethnic chauvinism. According to a faction of the Movement for the Actualization of Sovereign State of Biafra (MASSOB), the development was a clear testament “that Buhari is not seeing Ndigbo as part of Nigeria .”\\nThe presidency reluctantly addressed the dilemma, quipping that, “At the end of the exercise, no part of the country will be left feeling left out.” Unfortunately, recent events suggest otherwise. The much-awaited ministerial allocations have come and gone but failed to reflect the balance needed to allay the fear of Igbo marginalization.\\nAlthough it is true that Igbos, particularly Chibuike Amaechi, Kachikwu Ibe, and Godwin Emefiele, occupy powerful positions in the central government, the gesture is wallowed in mistrust. The crème of Igbo intelligentsia as well as leaders of the Biafran agitation perceive the motive as a postwar federal agenda to drive a wedge between the Igbos of the South East and their brothers and sisters of the South-South. Moreover, many are dismayed with the attempt by the Federal Government to isolate the history of Biafran movement solely to the Southeast. After all, not only does the Igbo territory extend beyond the Southeast, the die-hard leaders of the Biafran war included the natives of the South-South zone, such as Chukwuma Nzeogwu, Phillip Effiong, and Joe Achusia, to name a few.\\nThis medley of unforced errors on the part of APC government did nothing but play into the prevailing PDP narratives—those very fears narrated by my mother when I had called from America after Buhari’s victory. Today, the opposition is gaily saying “I told you so.” For the restless Eastern youths, it was the perfect excuse to finally embrace the call for secession from Nigeria —with Nnamdi Kanu as the totemic leader. Kanu has since been arrested and denied bail by the federal authorities. And different pleas for his release have also been rebuffed, leading to mass protests and loss of property as well as innocent lives.\\nBut the quagmire must not continue. Rather than brute force, there is the need for solution through diplomacy.\\nFirst, President Buhari should go above the fray and order without further delay the release of Nnamdi Kanu. There is no doubt that Kanu’s rhetoric is hugely offensive, and deserves every condemnation, but keeping him behind bars for expressing his fundamental rights of self-determination does more harm than good. The matter is gradually gaining worldwide sympathy, and Nigeria ’s economy must not be exposed to a new wave of ethnic havoc on top of Boko Haram.\\nSecond, the APC government ought to find ways to dialogue with the pro-Biafra groups and reassure them of a genuine desire to carry the Igbos along, with specific attention to youth employment. Such dialogue can help the agitators to realize that the real enemies include their own brothers, faceless politicians, who carted away development funds in the East.\\nThird, but most ironic, if the war against corruption is a good omen, Buhari must be careful to avoid being mired into another form of Igbo marginalization. Even though the anticorruption war has already visited high profile culprits in every other zone of the federation, notorious politicians in the Southeast are still acting as if Goodluck Jonathan still holds sway. It is time to double up and expose the political merchants who abetted ageless money-spinners, such as Enugu-Onitsha/Enugu-PH Expressways, 2nd River Niger Bridge, Dredging of River Niger, Akanu Ibiam International Airport, Sam Mbakwe International Cargo Airport, Constitutional Amendment exercise, the criminal demolition of Eastern Nigeria Secretariat at Enugu and, of course, various abandoned Constituency projects littered across the area. The president may as well head further south to unmask the incubus choking other vital projects with huge employment opportunities, particularly Calabar and PH ports, PH International Airport, and the East-West Highway . Seeing is believing. Nothing can assuage the feelings of these youths more than prosecuting the crooked politicians who exploited the poor masses for selfish gains.\\nThe view immediately above mirrors a topical goal of the current Biafran movement which, in its own words, strives to hold accountable “all looters, embezzlers, kidnappers, sponsors of terrorism, child traffickers, corrupt judges, crooked university lecturers, murderous Nigerian security forces and all thieving individuals masquerading as public officials who steal public funds thereby preventing developmental projects from impacting positively on the lives of the ordinary people.” This very idea of the pro-Biafra group is hardly unpopular. In fact, one may think their statement was adapted word-for-word from the campaign book of President Muhammadu Buhari. Said differently, these youths and Buhari share common dreams for a corrupt free society, after all. And they need each other. Sustaining our hard-fought change demands broad participation across the breadth and depth of Nigeria .',\n",

       " {'text': 'One look at the color of the Cayman Islands and you see why two million tourists make the journey every year. A land of aquatic lore; where yacht charters sail through sweet breezes for days spent swimming alongside sting rays, diving to sunken ships, and dropping anchor to access world class beaches that boast miles upon miles of sugar white sands. From the raucous fun of Georgetown in the Grand Cayman to the seductive slips of Little Cayman and the otherworldly visions down on the Brac – here’s your yacht charter guide to the Cayman Islands…\\nReasons to Charter a Yacht in the Cayman Islands\\nSeven Mile Beach\\nEvocative sands are one of the major sweeping draws of taking a yacht charter to the Cayman Islands. Following the main road out of Georgetown on Grand Cayman, this silky ribbon of paradise is constantly hailed as being one of the best beaches in the world. Beautifully maintained, brimming with vendors selling cold beer around the clock and fringed by coconut palms – you are cordially invited to chill.\\nYacht charters heading into the Cayman Islands will be blown away by the endless array of diving sites. Along with snorkeling around Eden’s Rock and the Devils Grotto, you should be sure to head to the Bloody Bay Wall on Little Cayman where the sheer drops into the abyss will have your heart racing. Beneath the waters all around the Caymans you will find sunken soviet battle ships, plunging coral walls and extraordinary visions of life.\\nA yacht charter to the Cayman Islands will showcase more than just white sands. Skull caves, rocky bluffs, and the wonder of the Crystal Caves are sure to take your breath away. The crystal cave especially is a riveting sight – with underground lakes and shimmering stalagmites that seem to be plucked from some fantasy land.\\nSwimming with stingrays, turtle centers, and islands of iguanas – the Cayman Islands delivers more than her fair share of wildlife wonders. Nature lovers will be in their element watching sharks glide through the predator reef at the conservation center, and on Cayman Brac you can even catch sight and sound of rare birds including the call of the Cayman Brac parrot.\\nWhere to Visit in the Cayman Islands\\nAll yacht charters to the Cayman Islands will kick start their Caribbean love affair on Grand Cayman. Home of glitzy shopping in colorful Georgetown, famed spot of the iconic Seven Mile Beach, and land of the north sides soaked Rum Point. Grand Cayman is pure vacation delight. You can abandon your yacht for days of snorkeling, dining at world class eateries like Blue by Eric Ripet, and hitting up the vibes of Georgetown.\\nSting Ray City\\nA highlight on any yacht charter to the Cayman Islands – take the three-hour trip from the Grand Cayman to experience the thrill of Stingray City. This shallow sandbar is as translucent as sea glass and filled with drifting angelic stingrays who glide around your feet without a care in the world. This is a unique chance to pet these gentle creatures, pose for photos, and generally get hands on with nature.\\nLovely Little Cayman is a picture of paradise. Home of some of the best diving sites on these shores, make sure that you traverse down Bloody Bay Wall. Those who prefer their water activities on the surface can take a kayak out towards Owen Island where, odds are, there won’t be another soul in sight. If you just want to take it easy, there is no finer way to spend the day than padding softly between hammock and rum bar – watching ancient iguanas crossing the road.\\nThe rocky bluffs of Cayman Brac invite intrepid travelers to take a walk on the wild side. Another divers delight – Cayman Brac is home to the underwater sculptures from Foot. Based on the Lost City of Atlantis you can dive down into the reef where a magical sunken world has been lovingly created. Buccaneer tales can also be unraveled over at Skull Cave where strange rock formations, secret chambers and graves provide a fascinating insight into the past.\\nWhen to Charter a Yacht in the Cayman Islands\\nSteady warm weather marks the Cayman Islands out as being an idyllic yacht charter getaway for those seeking Caribbean bliss. Between the months of March and June can be one of the best times to set sail for these islands as the crowds are fewer and the vibe languidly laid back. May through until November is the rainy season, although as they don’t last all day they do little to dampen spirits. Thanks to the location of the Cayman Islands in the Caribbean they are better protected from the fury of hurricanes.',\n",

       " {'text': 'AGCO/Fendt is pursuing its strategy to integrate highlights from the large tractor sector into smaller models, and is now pleased to unveil the compact powerhouses Fendt 200 Vario and 200 V/F/P Vario with pre-fitted guidance systems. Orchards, hop fields or vineyards can now also benefit from the commercial and ecological advantages offered by a guidance system. The 3.3 cc tractor with a 3-cylinder AGCO power engine is now emissions Stage IIIB (Tier 4 Interim), and includes a number of tried and tested advanced in-house features from AGCO/Fendt.\\nChoose from two guidance systems\\nOn the Fendt 200 Vario, the customer has a choice between two systems: a wayline-guided ultrasonic system, or position-guided system via GPS. With the wayline-guided system, the tractor maintains the exact specified distance to the crops when working with implement combinations. This takes the strain off the driver, who can now concentrate fully on the implement.\\nFor farms who grow vegetables, for example, the GPS guidance system is ideal. With the help of the high-precision satellite technology, the tractor can be steered with an accuracy of +/- 2 cm, even in adverse weather conditions. Benefits include optimal machine utilization and no overlapping.\\nThe guidance system is pre-fitted via an open interface provided by Fendt in the cab, which integrates the steering valve, cabling, steering angle sensors and safety system. It is based on the ISOBUS TIM functionality (Tractor Implement Management) promoted by the Agricultural Industry Electronics Foundation (AEF).\\nReichhardt GmbH is currently Fendt’s preferred system partner, and can offer the ultrasonic guidance system as well as the GPS system. Both guidance systems can be easily retrofitted. As soon as the AEF ISOBUS conformity test for TIM is available, all guidance systems which meet this criteria can be connected.\\nEmission Stage IIIB meets the emission standard and protects the environment\\nFitted with a 3.3 cc 3-cylinder AGCO power engine (AP 33 AWI), the emissions Stage IIIB Fendt 200 Vario and 200 V/F/P Vario meet the emissions standard thanks to AGRex (external exhaust gas recovery) and DOC (diesel oxidation catalyst) without the need for additional maintenance. Other innovations for the compact tractors from 70-110 hp include the reversible fan. The air flow direction switches when the fan blades are turned. This results in permanently clean fan grills, so increasing the performance and efficiency of the tractor and creating a huge time saving, as well as taking over the time-consuming driver’s job of manually cleaning the fan grill. One new feature is the front PTO 540 E, which reaches 540 rpm at a reduced engine speed and therefore saves on fuel. An air braking system with an electronically-controlled air dryer is available for the trailer system, ensuring less maintenance work and even better reliability.\\nFloor heater for winter\\nDriving comfort in the cab has been perfected by improvements to the seat cushion and extended back rest. The optional floor heater is ideal for use in winter. Fendt is integrating the electrical heater elements directly into the cab floor design, cleanly and without creating a trip hazard. Controlled by temperature sensors, the footwell is heated quickly and efficiently. The driver’s feet are always kept warm. A safety switch prevents overheating.\\nThe VarioActive steering feature is also adopted from the AGCO/Fendt large tractor range. This means fewer steering wheel turns to lock the wheels. At a low speed of less than 8 km/h, maximum wheel lock is achieved by just one turn of the steering wheel. The effect of the automatic steering system is reduced from 8 km/h to 18 km. With VarioActive, the farmer benefits from the quicker steering wheel reaction when performing tight turns or during front loading.\\nInnovations for the Fendt 200 Vario\\nModern implements require increasing flexibility and power from the tractor hydraulics. The new hydraulic concept will give the Fendt 200 Vario an outstanding pump capacity of 104 l/min thanks to the use of a load sensing pump (LS control pump). This allows drivers to operate the front loader quickly at low engine speed. A high level of operator comfort is provided by the electrical valves for front loading.\\nA power-beyond connection (pressure and control line, return) is also available as an option to increase the efficiency of implements, e.g. forage wagons. The front linkage in the Fendt 200 Vario has also been revamped. A new cast metal lower link frame with diagonally folding lower links creates additional clearance to the front loader. Further to this, the cast metal front plate and stroke cylinder have been reworked for more undercut. The new LED work lights both front and back and on the A-pillar ensure better vision. This means enhanced driving safety, as does the new automatic differential lock release, which is now activated regardless of the steering angle, and the 4WD mode shut-off.\\nFrom November 2017, the new Fendt 200 Vario and Fendt 200 V/F/P/ Vario will be available for the first time with the new technology.',\n",

       " {'text': 'An application programming interface(API) consists of a set of standards and programming instructions for accessing a Web tool or Web-based software application. The Application Program interface is a set of protocols, routines and tools required for building software applications. An API specifies the way in which the software components should interact. Additionally, APIs are used when the graphical user interface(GUI) components are to be programmed. A good API provides all the building blocks and makes it easier to develop a program. A programmer puts all the building blocks together.\\nDifferent types of APIs are available for operating systems, applications or websites. For example, ‘Windows’ has many API sets that are being used by the system hardware and applications i.e. when users copy and paste text from one application to another, it is the API that makes it work. Most of the operating environments, such as MS-Windows also provides APIs which allows the programmers to write applications that are consistent with the operating environment. Today, the websites also specify the APIs. For example, with the help of Amazon or eBay APIs, developers can create specialized web stores by using the existing retail infrastructure. Third-party software developers can also use Web APIs so as to create software solutions for the end-users.\\nAn API is not a user interface but a software-to-software interface. With APIs, applications are allowed to communicate with each other without any user intervention. When you buy movie tickets online and enter your credit card information, Web site makes use of an API to send your credit card information to a remote application that verifies whether your information is correct or not. Once the payment gets confirmed, the remote application sends back a response to the Web site notifying that it is \\'OK\\' to issue the tickets.\\nIntroduction to Selenium WebDriver:\\nWebDriver is one of the most powerful and popular tools of the Selenium toolkit. WebDriver is an extended version to Selenium RC with surplus advantages and it overcomes many of its limitations. Unlike Selenium IDE, WebDriver provides support to many latest browsers and platforms. In the case of WebDriver, the selenium server isn’t required to be started prior to the test scripts execution, unlike Selenium RC. Selenium 2.0 is an aggregation of Selenium RC with WebDriver API. Selenium was developed so as to support dynamic web pages and Ajax calls. It also supports various drivers to perform web-based mobile app testing.\\nSelenium WebDriver Framework for API Testing\\nIT enterprises globally are implementing various automation solutions in order to provide effective and efficient software testing services. New and innovative approaches have been developed for test automation utilizing the Selenium framework, thereby helping the enterprises to improve their service quality and thereby reducing the costs. Keeping this in mind, the Selenium framework has been developed as it helps the testing teams to automate the validations of URL based APIs.\\nSelenium Based Automation Regression Suite:\\nSelenium framework is a data-driven solution that consists of i) Java-based Driver scripts ii) Frameworks methods created as per method types of APIs.\\nBenefits of Selenium Framework\\n1. Selenium framework takes considerably less time to prepare test data or to validate each scenario in comparison to manual testing.\\n2. For the preparation of the data and to validate 350 scenarios, it takes approximately 7 man-days per resource. However, with the implementation of the selenium framework, the time gets reduced to 1.5 hours (approximately).\\n3. It is easy to develop the Selenium framework and the test cases can be maintained effortlessly.\\n4. It is possible to integrate the Selenium framework with Continuous Integration(CI) build deployment process.\\npublic static String PostRequest(String PostRequestURL,String Parameters) throws\\nSystem.setProperty(\"http.proxyHost\", \"Proxy server IP\"); // Enter your proxy name here\\nSystem.setProperty(\"http.proxyPort\", \"Proxy server port\");\\nHttpPost POSTrequest = new HttpPost(PostRequestURL);\\nStringEntity param =new StringEntity(Parameters);\\nHttpResponse response = httpClient.execute(POSTrequest);\\nBufferedReader rd = new BufferedReader(newInputStreamReader(response.getEntity().getContent()));\\nAssert.assertTrue(statuscode==200, \"Failed : HTTP error code :\"+statuscode);\\nSystem.out.println(\"output is =\" +responseData);\\nSelenium framework simplifies API validation by building the test cases.

Considering the size of the local market and the pressing need that Brazil has in increasing the innovation rhythm, technology usage and development, the country can already be seen as a big global player by companies from this sector. In this moment, the more accurate motto for companies that want to act or are acting in Brazil is “Innovate or Die.”\\nAfter a cycle of more than 10 years of continuous growth, that put the country in evidence on the global landscape as part of the select group of so-called BRICs (Brasil, Russia, India and China) and that stressed even more its leadership in Latin America, Brazil is now entering, in the past two years, a moment of political tension that has reflected directly in the economy. The moment now is of reviewing and restructuring.

And the solutions to problems from different countries can only be found locally.\\nInvesting in the right time and in the right moment\\nDespite the low participation of Brazil in the semiconductors industry, the country has a great potential to use the Internet of Things and to develop in this sector. It is a field in which no one has the advantage yet: we are, theoretically, in the same level as United States and China. Besides that, a chip to a sensor for IoT is cheaper and easier to develop than one made for smartphones. Therefore, it is less costly to invest in IoT.\\nIn the technology world, the innovation chain has inverted itself recently, with the large domain of big multinational companies giving space to startups and new entrepreneurs. This movement creates a pulverization of opportunities. It is no longer something concentrated, in the domain of few big players like it used to be. There is space for companies from outside the country and also for the appearance of new local players that can learn and develop their own systems and foment the industry.\\nThe technology giants, that lost a wave of opportunities that emerged with the mobile business (smartphones, tablets and M2M), now are moving rapidly so they don’t miss out on the opportunities that the IoT segment will bring. There are several examples in this direction and IBM is one of them, since its announcement, in December of 2015, to return to the consumer electronics market, ten years after selling its computer division to the Chinese Lenovo. The problem is that there are a lot of companies, big and small, repeating the same strategies in the search of its own space in the technology market. This needs to change. The motto “Innovate or Die” also needs to be applied in the planning.\\nIoT as a transforming agent of an economy\\nAs well as in great transformations of the past, the revolution caused by IoT will change the entire landscape of the career scenario. It is estimated that in time, it will be possible to see 20 to 30 million jobs migrate, and some functions might disappear, thanks to robotics, intelligent machines and artificial intelligence (AI), that will infiltrate in new corporate areas and automate the positions that are repetitive and transitional.\\nBut what it seems like bad news is in fact a readaptation, from work stations focused on operational to opportunities in areas that demands data analysis, ability to solve problems, think creatively, innovate and work within a team. Nothing too distant from the profile that today is comprehended as a good professional. It is an evolutionary movement, driven by technology.\\nIf the job openings in operational work stations tend to drop, the opportunities to professionals that seek qualification and even reinvention will grow a lot. It is a market that, according to IDC, will grow about US$1, 7 trillion until 2020. This amount needs, and will be, shared among the professionals that manage to keep up with the demands of the market.\\nAbout José Antônio Scodiero\\nWith over 30 years of experience in areas like information technology, personal computing, semiconductors, entrepreneurship and startups, José Antônio Scodiero has already acted as a high level executive in several big and successful international corporations like: IBM; Apple Computer; OkiData, where he was president of the Brazilian subsidiary, and more recently; AMD, leader in the semiconductors segment, where he held the position of Vice-President for the Latin America region. José Antônio Scodiero is graduated in Electronics Engineering with specialization in hardware and microelectronics and has an MBA in Corporate Administrations by Fundação Armando Álvares Penteado (FAAP).\\nAs an entrepreneur, he founded lots of startup companies since the 90’s, having created his first company when he was only 24 years old. In 2009 he founded Fast Company Brazil, with the objective of catapulting multinational organizations, from sectors like digital technology, semiconductors and software that are seeking to install subsidiaries in the Brazilian and Latin American markets. In 2010 he obtained the certification of Corporate Governance from the Brazilian Institute of Corporate Governance (IBGC) and started acting as a consulting advisor in companies in 2011. In 2012, he became president of the task force of semiconductors of AMCHAM – American Chamber for Brazil and USA. Still in 2012, Scodiero was also elected Director of SBMICRO – Brazilian Society of Microelectronics, where he remains until the end of 2016.\\nThis article first appeared on Insight Success.',\n",

       " {'text': 'Nearly half of the barbecue charcoal bought in Europe contains wood from tropical and subtropical forests, with little of it certified sustainable, raising fears that some of it is illegally logged.\\nThe finding comes from an analysis1 of thousands of charcoal samples, using a pioneering microscopy technique. Scientists also found that many bags of charcoal incorrectly labelled the type of wood inside or failed to mention it at all, lending weight to concerns about their true origin.\\n“This is just an overview but it’s absolutely enough to cause alarm, because we found so much tropical timber,” said Volker Haag, a wood anatomist at the Thünen Institute of Wood Research in Hamburg, Germany, who led the work.\\nThe researchers harnessed developments in microscopy that are transforming attempts to probe the opaque, multimillion-dollar international charcoal business. Campaigners think that up to two million tonnes of illegally harvested tropical wood might enter Europe as charcoal each year.\\nThe European Union imported some 750,000 tonnes of charcoal in 2019. Source countries include Nigeria (20%) and Paraguay (7%), which are known for widespread illegal deforestation. But once any wood charcoal enters Europe, it can be sold legally, because it is not covered by the European Timber Regulation (EUTR), legislation that prohibits firms from placing on the EU market timber that has been logged illegally.\\nCharcoal is tricky to analyse because the original wood has lost many of its signature features, such as colour and smell, and it crumbles easily. But Haag has developed a 3D-reflected-light microscopy technique that digitally reconstructs sections of charcoal from irregular lumps to create images from which the parent wood can be identified — often to genus level. This is enough to disprove many claims about a wood’s origin.\\nHaag’s team analysed 4,500 samples from 150 charcoal bags bought in 11 countries in 2019 and 2020. Some 46% included wood from subtropical and tropical forests, which have the highest deforestation rates in the world. In Spain, Italy, Poland and Belgium, this figure was more than 60% (see ‘Charred origins’). Of these, only one-quarter of bags bore the logos of sustainable-certification organizations such as the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC).\\nIn addition, only one-quarter of the bags specified the species or origin of the wood — and only half of these declarations were correct. The work was published in IAWA Journal, a publication of the International Association of Wood Anatomists.\\n“If you find a product with the wrong species inside, it’s a very strong indicator for illegality,” says co-author Johannes Zahnen, a forest-policy specialist with the Berlin-based wildlife charity WWF Germany. “Combining it with the knowledge that most tropical charcoal is coming from Nigeria and Paraguay, there’s a high likelihood of illegality.”\\nZahnen calls for the EUTR to be extended to charcoal, and for authorities to compel suppliers to label their bags.\\nPhil Guillery, director of supply-chain integrity at the FSC, which is headquartered in Bonn, Germany, says the study shows that when sustainability certification is used, it is largely accurate. Since 2017, the FSC has been using another microscopy technique to verify origin claims on charcoal bags in an effort to stop wood ‘laundering’. “The ability to test charcoal has had a huge impact,” says Guillery.',\n",

Roxanna Brown describes the San Kamphaeng kiln complex as the second most extensive in Lan Na (Brown 1988, 82). Sayan Prishanchit proposes that the San Kamphaeng kilns operated from the first half of the thirteenth century to the late sixteenth century, and he offers a preliminary chronology based on the following evidence (Sayan 1999, 170):\\n1) Inground kiln structures and ware types were similar to those of the MON phase of activity (Most Original Node, thirteenth-fourteeth century) at Sawankhalok. (Sayan mentions a date of eleventh-twelfth century for this phase, but Don Hein now dates it tentatively to the thirteenth-fourteenth century Hein 2001.)\\n2) Wat Chiang Saen in Sam Kamphaeng district was constructed circa 1451-88. Archaeological excavation at the site recovered green-glazed wares from the stratum below that of the temple construction.\\n3) According to the Chiang Mai Chronicle, in 1365 (at the end of the Yuan period) the Chinese court\\'s request for tribute from Chiang Mai included \"1,000 ceramic plates of Jaesak,\" including 500 decorated pieces, 200 green-glazed pieces, and 300 white wares. (Sayan admits this association with San Kamphaeng wares is not definitive.)\\nSayan also mentions that small quantities of San Kamphaeng wares have been excavated from sites in the cities of Suphanburi and Ayutthaya (Sayan 1999, 171). These finds may be relevant to the discovery of San Kamphaeng dishes on two shipwrecks dating to the late fourteenth or early fifteenth century, together with large unglazed gray jars from the Ban Bang Pun kilns near Suphanburi (Brown 2004). The dishes are green glazed on the interior and unglazed on the exterior.

       " {'text': 'A visual history of web APIs\\nThis is a very basic intro to APIs that was part of an upcoming article about API strategies.\\nThere was a time when simply having a website would entitle a company to call itself “digital”. Almost all content on a website was for humans. Then the search engines emerged and websites started to be optimised for them to be able to reach their target audience.\\nNevertheless roughly 4–10% of the information in the world is accessible through public search engines and the rest are hidden in deep web (not to be mistaken with dark web or darknet). So far a web page was a mixture of content and the UI that made it easy for humans to digest. The page (in HTML format) was usually “rendered” on the server side. Most user interactions were processed on the server side which required a full page reload — the server usually ran some business logic and put the resulting data (also called Model in many frameworks) in a “template” (usually called View) to render a new HTML page.\\nWith the advent of Ajax and Dynamic HTML, the web page that was already loaded into the browser started to talk to the server and update itself. Despite its complexity, this way of handling UI moved the needles of conversion and user experience in the right direction. Therefore the developers pushed the idea to the point where the main part of the UI only needed to be loaded once and could update itself just by passing and receiving data to the server while handling business logic in the browser. Single page apps (SPA) were born!\\nThis was very similar to the experience the users were getting from the installed mobile apps. The only difference was that the HTTP protocol was used to also serve the UI in the web world.\\nWith the advent of REST, even backend services started to talk to each other in a machine friendly format (usually JSON) over the web protocol (HTTP). This is where things started to get interesting. Apps could leverage the power of various services (mostly running on the cloud by this time) using now-called Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). There is no limitations to how many servers an app can talk to.\\nIn many ways APIs are the younger brother of the RPC on steroids. The real power of APIs is their simplicity for the machines and programs to talk to each other regardless of their architecture, location or even programming language.\\nSidenote: we are using “server” and “service” here interchangeably for the sake of simplicity. The company offering is the “service” while the actual code running on a machine to expose that service is the “server”. In practice the part of the code that is run on the browser is called “frontend” while the rest is called “backend”. The backend can run on a server in the cloud or on premise. Even then, it can run on a dedicated machine (virtual, containerized or physical) or it can run on a one-off basis (serverless). But these technical details are not super important for an intro to the API strategy.\\nToday billions of people use APIs on a daily basis to get through their life. Anything from a simple search to banking transactions (eg. SWIFT) to playing music (eg. Spotify) and from controlling IoT devices (eg. Philips Hue) to even controlling the very essence of the cloud (eg. AWS) uses APIs. There are even services that connect these APIs together to create more tangible applications (eg. IFFT). APIs themselves are mostly offered as SaaS but even PaaS offerings like Azure have an API.\\nPublic vs Private vs Internal APIs\\nJust like services behind them APIs have a vast diversity:\\n- public APIs: these are usually the ones that come to mind when speaking of APIs. The Twitter, Facebook and YouTube APIs are some of the famous ones. Trivia: Facebook’s recent Cambridge Analytica scandal is a good example of power of APIs abused. The public APIs are usually the main area of building an API strategy. Nevertheless, there are other groups of APIs that are equally important.\\n- private APIs: are usually shared between a company and its partners or customers. For example Spotify might have exposed an API to Volvo cars that have built in support for its services. These APIs can make or break strategic partnership between companies and if done correctly can generate a great source of revenue.\\n- internal APIs: are used by your own front-end (web, mobile) to talk to your backend. With the advent of microservices it is increasingly common for backends to talk to each other using a internal APIs which is also called server-to-server (S2S) or inter-server. The internal APIs usually don’t have an extensive documentation and since the code is available internally, usually that serves the purpose. Nevertheless they are an important facilitator for separation of concerns and are a great tool to tame the complexity of the server implementation. An example is Tesla Model S API that’s used by its own mobile apps to control the vehicle.\\nProtected vs Open APIs\\nDepending on the access level, APIs fall in two categories:\\n- protected APIs: the ones that need some sort of authorization to work (usually using OAuth 2)\\n- open APIs: the ones that are open to the web, just like regular web pages and anyone can make calls to them. The open APIs usually have some sort of rate limiting to prevent DDoS attacks and keeping the infrastructure costs under control.\\nTo facilitate working with the API many top services come with a software development kit (SDK) that is usually a thin wrapper on top of the language-neutral API endpoints (also called API surface) providing a language-specific library for doing the ceremonies of talking to the API. Using an SDK facilitates API calls to asynchronous function/method calls native to a particular language.\\nUnlike user interfaces or web pages, APIs can’t claim to be “intuitive”. In fact most APIs are merely endpoints that return results and status codes. Threfore many APIs come with an accompanying developer portal which is a content site that provides documentation (tutorial, examples, endpoint references), links to SDKs, token generation, licensing, pricing, etc.\\nThe developer portals more or less serve as “the UI of the API” without being an actual use case for the API.\\nThis article was originally part of a deeper article about API strategy.

       " {'text': 'Even if you understand how essential taxes are and their role in keeping the country functional, it’s no fun paying them. Unfortunately, there is no way to avoid them either, not entirely at least. But there are ways that you can reduce your tax obligation. These tax breaks come in two varieties: deductions and tax credits.\\nIn order to pay just enough taxes and not a dollar more, you need to understand all the tax breaks you are eligible for. Some of the most common ones, like the RRSP, are relatively well known, but there are some tax breaks you might be ignoring.\\nIn Canada, you pay for your healthcare through taxes. The free healthcare that anyone can benefit from is funded by the people, and when you have your public health insurance, most of your medical expenses are virtually free.\\nThe keyword here is most, and the medical expenses that fall out of its domain might get you a decent tax break. You might not be able to claim a relatively smaller amount since there is a minimum threshold. Only expenses that are either above $2,397 or 3% of your net income (whichever is lesser) can be claimed.\\nThis means that if you have spent a significant sum on eligible medical expenses (nursing home, cancer treatments, certain transplants, etc.), you might be able to get a decent tax-break. Many of these expenses can be claimed even if they have happened outside of Canada.\\nAnother sizeable tax-break\\nApart from the unlikely tax-break you might be able to claim if you had significant medical expenses in the tax year, there is one break you can take advantage of every year, and that’s your RRSP contributions.\\nYou get to fund your retirement with the pre-tax dollars, which can lower your tax bill substantially. And if you can grow that amount in a good stock like Canadian Apartment Properties REIT (TSX:CAR.UN), you will be able to off-set the future taxes on that amount by a significant margin.\\nCAPREIT is one of the oldest aristocrats in the industry, and ironically, it’s a REIT that its investors do not prefer for its dividends. That’s understandable if you consider its modest 2.74% yield and bare minimum dividend growth (even though a very stable payout ratio backs it).\\nThe chief attraction of this relatively undervalued REIT is its growth potential. Before the market crash of 2020, the REIT was growing at a decent pace. The growth has become stagnant since the crash, but the chances that this REIT might pick up where it left are strong enough. Its revenues and profits have been growing year over year, and 2020 was no exception.\\nIf it keeps growing at its 10-year CAGR of 15.1% rate, it can convert your $10,000 investment into $40,000 in one decade.\\nGiven your personal and particular circumstances, you might be eligible for some tax credits that not everyone is eligible for. Make sure you do your homework before doing your taxes and identify every area where you can save money on your taxes.',\n",

If your local lumber yard does not stock thicker woods, ask them if there is a specialty house in your area.\\nThe second item worth mentioning, is that I recommend using a hardwood for you doors. A good choice would be poplar wood. It is the least expensive hardwood, easy to work with and finishes nicely, especially if you plan to prime and paint. Soft woods like pine tend to warp or wain and check easily and aren\\'t the best for framing long narrow stiles etc.\\nAs far as the tools and techniques for sizing custom stock, a table saw and planner are the best. The term \"resawing\" refers to cutting the thickness of narrower stock, say less than 4\" with a table saw. One would set up using a feather board and a 80 tooth or hollow ground planner blade. This often gives a decent sandable cut, but not a real furniture grade finish. A planner is your best bet for a decent initial smooth finish that can be sanded to a good finish. The combination of using both is often required for custom sizing. Usually one side of your stock will have a good factory finish ready to sand, so do your DIY cutting all on one side of the stock that will not be as visible in the finished product.',\n",

Not pose any risk to food chain,\" he adds.\\nThe FAO says that the current strain of AH1N1 is a combination of human genes, pigs and poultry, for the moment, there is more lethal than the virus of seasonal influenza, although it could worsen if combined with H5N1, the avian influenza.\\n\"Chile has not motivated by the H5N1 flu. If the outbreak had occurred in Southeast Asia, where the virus circulates in abundance among the poultry population, the introduction of influenza A viruses have caused greater concern, affects Lubroth .\\n\"We need to increase surveillance of the situation in animals and strengthen veterinary services in poor countries with economies in transition, thus providing them with adequate diagnostic capability and field teams competent and adequately resourced to respond to emergencies, \"he adds.',\n",

       " {'text': 'Reduce Stress and Anxiety With Essential Oils:\\nGet Your At Home Spa On!\\nAnxiety and stress can inflict horrible symptoms on people of any age and if you’re not sure which common ailments are stress and anxiety related, just look at symptoms of stress and you’ll understand very easily. These days, even kids need new methods of stress management and anxiety reducers that even 10 years ago, simply didn’t exist.\\nAnxiety and stress come in all sorts of different forms including social anxiety, panic attacks, or simply an inability to cope with the pressure of a hectic schedule and a hectic day. Anxiety raises your heart rate, causes you mental fatigue, and this not only creates stress, it can cause danger to your physical and emotional health and overall sense of well being.\\nSometimes this results in a decision to see a therapist, use pills or other chemicals to help the feelings of repeated anxiety and stress. However, some of these drugs have unknown side effects, and some can even cause future health problems. This is why it’s good to keep in mind the fact that essential oils are all-natural solutions and relaxing ways for you to reduce stress and anxiety, calm your nerves, get a better night’s sleep, and stay at the top of your performance levels.\\nHow Essential Oils Help\\nWhen you feel like you have difficulty with concentration, and your efficiency levels are down, this might simply be a sign that it’s time to try the all-natural solutions which essential oils offer. Also look out for moments when you tend to feel down more than usual. It could be a simple case of sluggishness or it might be a wake-up call to implement some healthy changes.\\nDysfunctional relationships are also a major cause of anxiety and stress. If your relationship is in distress, worrying and focusing on your fears can make you feel more stressed and cause you to feel more anxious, as a result. These are other signs that some all-natural solutions need to be implemented in your life.\\nEssential oils can help soothe and relax your mind from this type of stress and anxiety and this soothing pleasure means less time you spend worrying. Worrying about distressed relationships never tends to enhance physical or mental/emotional health, so using aromatherapy can help keep your body strong and relieve your physical stress, too.\\nSo whenever you find yourself overwhelmed from the anxiety and stress of work, school, home life, etc., trying essential oils offers you a new change to lift your spirits and help you to conquer pessimism over those bothersome situations. Regaining control of your emotions is what you need the most and it’s also good for you to remember that this can be done without the need of prescription pills, chemicals, alcohol and other commonly used stress reducers.\\nEssential oils accomplish your goal of a more relaxed state of mind without giving you any negative side effects. If you haven’t tried essential oils before, now might be a good time to try few drops here and there so that you can get the refreshing feeling of relief from stress and anxiety now.\\nTop Essential Oil Combination To Reduce Stress And Anxiety\\nThe following essential oils are great for reducing stress and anxiety in your life. These three essential oils are particularly noted for their importance for good meditation and anxiety reduction. You can use them individually for their separate benefits, but it’s been recommended to use them together because of their combined potence as an all-natural solution to debilitating anxiety and daily stress.\\nBergamot Essential Oil\\nBergamot is a refreshing and uplifting essential oil. It is extracted from the peel of the fruit, and its citrus aroma helps lift you spiritually and rids you from negative thoughts. It helps your emotional balance, your sense of well being, and keeps you focused. It’s also known to be an anti-depressant and works effectively as an all-natural sedative.\\nCedarwood Essential Oil\\nCedarwood is a soothing essential oil that helps you reduce stress from your body and mind. This oil is extracted from the Virginian Cedar tree, so its fragrance is woody and refreshing to the mind. It has strong relaxing benefits and can also alleviate problems with insomnia.\\nFrench Lavender Essential Oil\\nFrench Lavender is one of the most popular flowery scents that exists and it really rejuvenates your mind quickly! This scent is French-born and has long been considered a therapeutic fragrance. It’s powerful to reduce stress from your mind, and it can even alleviate the aches and pains from your muscles, as well.\\nUses of Essential Oil Combination: Your At Home Spa!\\nHere are some great ideas to get you started with your stress and anxiety reduction pack. These are just a few of the numerous ideas of successful methods of application and surely, once you start using these essential oils and feeling the benefits, you’ll discover many more!\\n- Dilute a couple of drops of your potent essential oils into a carrier oil, then get (or give yourself) a long, relaxing massage\\n- Make a steam inhalation by placing a few drops of your essential oils into a bowl of hot water, covering your head with a towel, then simply inhaling the delicious vapour\\n- Apply 1 to 2 drops of your essential oils on a cup of epsom salts*, then dissolve that into your bathwater for a special anti-stress bath\\n- Place your potent combo into a diffuser to inhale the peace while you exhale stress and anxiety; try an effective and specific diffuser like: Aura Cacia Diffuser – Aromatherapy Vaporizer with Oil, 1.64\\n*A great place for your epsom salts: myOTCstore.com – Online health and beauty shop.\\n**Be sure to test your essential oils for allergic reactions.\\n***Less is more, it only takes 1-2 drops because these essential oils are very powerful.\\nWhich of these methods of use do you plan to try? Tell us about it in the comments!\\nDo you know someone this could help? Please remember to share it with them, thanks!',\n",

       " {'text': '(SAN FRANCISCO) -- The U.S. Coast Guard suspended a search for a sailboat off the California coast Tuesday and conceded there is a chance the distress call that triggered a massive hunt was a hoax.\\nThe Coast Guard received a distress signal about 5:30 p.m. Sunday reporting a sailboat was sinking and a family of four was abandoning ship.\\nAn intense search by air and sea, deploying resources from the Coast Guard and the California National Guard, was called off Tuesday.\\n\"We\\'ve saturated the area with multiple assets over a roughly 42 hours period, searched approximately 20,000 square miles and we have come up with no signs of distress, no debris in the water and that has led us to suspend this case,” Coast Guard Chief Petty Officer Mike Lutz told ABC News.\\n\"There\\'s always that chance [it\\'s a hoax], but as far as we\\'re concerned, anytime we get a call for distress, we treat it as peoples\\' lives are in danger and we\\'ll treat it like that until we have reason to believe otherwise,\" Lutz said.\\nNobody has been reported missing and no boats are missing from marinas, he said.\\nThe names of those reportedly on board and their destination were unknown, however the missing were said to include a man and a woman, their 4-year-old son, and his cousin, Coast Guard Lt. Heather Lampert said.\\nOfficials were told the boat\\'s electronics system was failing as it took on water, making it impossible for rescuers to determine the precise location where it went down.\\nRescuers initially believed the boat was sinking 65 miles from Pillar Point, just south of San Francisco, Lampert said. After reviewing radio tapes and making new calculations, Lampert said the search effort was shifted slightly south to 65 miles off the coast of Monterey Bay.\\nCopyright 2013 ABC News Radio',\n",

       " {'text': 'Latest Team Rankings\\nFree Text Alerts\\n|ShopMobileRadio RSSRivals.com Yahoo! Sports|\\n|College Teams||High Schools|\\nAugust 29, 2011Lost in the shuffle of all the talk surrounding Nebraska\\'s new offense on Saturday will be some of the changes you\\'ll see with the Blackshirt defense.\\nFor the first time in four years Carl Pelini will work exclusively as NU\\'s defensive coordinator, which has allowed head coach Bo Pelini to spend more with the offense than ever before.\\nA lot has had to happen for Bo Pelini to get to this point as a head coach. No. 1, he had to feel comfortable with handing over all the daily coordinator duties over to his brother.\\nNo. 2, back in 2008 John Papuchis was a first-year position coach and Carl Pelini had just one year of coordinator experience underneath his belt at the time. I think Papuchis had to grow into his role as a defensive line coach, while Carl Pelini had to get comfortable in running the defense before the time was right to make this move.\\n\"It\\'s different. A lot of it\\'s different from how we\\'ve handled camp and spring and a lot of it is the same,\" Carl Pelini said of his new role. \"We still work as a team - Bo and I, but he\\'s very involved with the offense. Much more involved.\"\\nIn the past when Shawn Watson ran the offense Bo Pelini had very little involvement if any during the daily meetings and game planning.\\nNow Bo Pelini splits his time between the offense and defense and is heavily involved with Tim Beck and the offensive staff, as well as the defensive staff meetings.\\n\"He\\'s in their meetings like he\\'s in our meetings too,\" Carl Pelini said. \"I still have to answer to (Bo), but so does Tim (Beck). I always laugh and keep saying to Tim that (the offense) is finally getting what we got for three years. It\\'s good to see. It\\'s a little bit of justice.\"\\nFrom a players perspective Carl Pelini used to work with the defensive tackles during individual drills each day over the last three years.\\nWith his new role he has the ability to float around to all the different position groups on the defense, while Papuchis works with all four defensive linemen in practice.\\n\"I think Carl (Pelni) is happy with (his new role),\" senior Jared Crick said. \"He\\'s no longer hanging out just with us on the defensive line. He\\'s overseeing the entire defense. I\\'m sure that\\'s what he wanted to do because he\\'s a defensive coordinator. I\\'m sure he\\'s been waiting to do this for a long time.\"\\nAnd ultimately if Carl Pelini is going to take that next step and become a head coach a move like this had to be made. I think this will be huge for his development and go a long way in the future since he\\'ll be installing and calling most of the defense this season.\\nI think most people thought with the move to the Big Ten there would be no more \"what channel will the game be on TV\" questions, since technically every game will be now be televised no matter what.\\nFor whatever reason there\\'s been a lot of confusion for Nebraska\\'s first two games as to what channel they\\'ll be carried on.\\nBoth the Chattanooga game and the Fresno State games will be carried on the Big Ten Network. The confusing part is there\\'s a possibility the game could be aired on one of the BTN\\'s two overflow game channels depending on what market you live in.\\nThe Big Ten Network website offers this guide to show you what channel the games will be on in your perspective market each week. Cox Cable in Omaha will officially move the BTN to channels 80 and 1080 HD starting Sept. 1.\\n\"Cox subscribers can watch the Husker\\'s season opener on the Big Ten Network at 2:30pm on Saturday, Sept. 3rd,\" stated Cox spokeswoman, Gail Graeve, \"Effective Sept. 1st, Cox will carry the Big Ten Network on Cox channel 80 and in HD on Cox channel 1080.\"\\nTime Warner Cable in Lincoln will air Saturday\\'s game on channels 24 and 1333 in HD.\\nMy best guess for the starting five on the offensive line is Jermarcus Hardrick at left tackle, Andrew Rodriguez at left guard, Mike Caputo at center, Jake Cotton at right guard and Tyler Moore at right tackle.\\nHowever, I expect Marcel Jones, Jeremiah Sirles, Brent Qvale and Spencer Long to all play a factor and see time as well.\\nI think the starting five I mentioned are the guys who have been healthy throughout camp and demonstrated the most consistent play over that period.\\nIt was good to see sophomore Jason Ankrah win the starting defensive end job opposite of junior Cameron Meredith.\\nAnkrah is a guy that came to NU with a lot of hype, but it\\'s taken him a couple of years to get comfortable in the defense.\\nJunior Josh Williams is the back-up behind both Ankrah and Meredith, but both juniors Eric Martin and Joseph Carter should see plenty of time. You get the sense that Martin could operate as more of a pass rushing specialist on third downs.\\nI can\\'t remember a time where five true freshmen could potentially have as big of a role this season in the offense.\\nMoore looks to be a starter at right tackle, Jamal Turner figures to play a big factor at receiver and in the return game, while freshmen running back Aaron Green, Braylon Heard and Ameer Abdullah are also expected to play big roles as well.\\nThe scary thing is there are still several other players in this class who are poised to be early contributors, but based on need you may not see them on the field right away.\\nI snuck out to Seacrest Stadium on Friday night to watch Lincoln Southwest vs. Lincoln Southeast. Local Lincoln football enthusiasts say Friday\\'s crowd of 8,501 is the largest crowd to see a game in Lincoln since the early 90\\'s when a couple of semifinal match-ups featured Lincoln Southeast.\\nIt\\'s great to see Lincoln high school football is making a comeback. It\\'s taken 10 years to get it back to this point ever since the openings of Lincoln Southwest and Lincoln North Star.\\nAfter watching the game, I will say the jury is still out on Kansas State commit Tavarius Bender, as he struggled going only 6-of-15 with three interceptions. This week\\'s 4:30 pm game against Omaha Westside at Seacrest will be an opportunity for him to redeem himself.\\nTwo names to watch in the future in Lincoln are Southeast defensive back/quarterback Najee Jackson and Southwest linebacker Josh Banderas. Both players had huge games and are definitely names to watch for the class of 2013 as potential Nebraska targets.\\n15:03. If you are wondering that was exactly how long it took for Pelini to get asked his first question about Tennessee Chattanooga.\\nIn fact none of NU\\'s players were asked any specific questions about the Mocs.\\nI\\'m not saying UTC is going to come in and challenge the Huskers, but hopefully after last year\\'s South Dakota State scare Pelini will have this team focused and ready to go. The good thing is this is the season opener, where last year\\'s SDSU game came after the Washington game when everybody in college football was anointing Nebraska as the second coming of the 85\\' Bears.\\nLet\\'s get this thing going. Saturday can\\'t get here fast enough.\\nSean Callahan can be reached at firstname.lastname@example.org and he can be heard each day at 6:50 am and 4:50 pm on Big Red Radio 1110 KFAB in Omaha during the football season. He can also be seen on KETV Channel 7 TV in Omaha during the fall and each week he appears on NET\\'s Big Red Wrap Tuesday\\'s at 7 pm.',\n",

       " {'text': \"In business intelligence, we all know and espouse the fact that data integration is the most time-consuming part of the build process. This is undeniably true. However, if one were to look at the long-term (me: not a full-time analyst, but observant of the implementations I've been in for a full lifecycle over the past few years), I believe most long-term costs clearly fall into the data access layer. This is where the reports, dashboards, alerts, etc. are built.\\nThis is true for a variety of reasons, not the least of which is a short-cutting of the data modeling process, which, when done well, minimizes the gap between design and usage. This aspect of BI is receiving only modest recognition. The focus instead is on a new breed of disruptive data access tools that are architecturally doing side-runs around the legacy tools in how they use memory and advanced visualization. Specifically, these tools are Tableau, QlikTech, and Spotfire. These tools attack a very important component of the long-term cost of BI - the cost of IT having to continue to do everything post-production.\\nThere are a few areas where these tools are getting recognition:\\n- They perform faster - this allows a user, in the 30 minutes of time he has to do an analysis, to get to a deeper level of root cause analysis\\n- They are seen as more intuitive - this empowers the end user so they can do more, versus getting IT involved, which stalls a thought stream and introduces delay which can obliterate the relevancy\\n- They visualize data differently - I won't expound on it here and I don't think it's necessarily due to the tool architecture, but many claim it's better\\nSo why do I bring it up in opposition to outsourced business intelligence? Because to truly set up business intelligence to work in a self-service capacity, you would overweigh the idea of working closely with users in the build process, which is a lever that gets deemphasized in outsourced BI. You would see business intelligence as less a technical exercise and more as an empowerment exercise. You would keep the build closer to home, where the support would be. And you would not gear up an offshore group to handle a laborious process of maintaining the data layer over the years in the way users desire. You would invest in users - culture, education, information use - instead of outsourced groups. And this is just what many are doing now.\\nPosted August 14, 2011 10:52 AM\\nPermalink | 2 Comments |\",\n",

I don't think he has great accuracy, I don't think he has a great arm, and I don't think he has great vision either. I would say he will be a good quaterback, but never be great. Heres the thing we don't need great, we need good we need a guy that doesn't throw a lot of of interceptions, which he doesn't, but we also need accuracy and right now he doesn't have it, right now he is not a good QB. Trent Green was a good QB behind phenomenal line he had great accuracy and an average arm. Cassel doesn't have the luxury of a good line, and has bad accuracy he overthrows balls or underthrows so when a receiver catches the ball he has to slow down to catch it because of his slow release. I don't think he is worth what we are paying him, because I think he is a 3rd pick at best and we are paying him like a 1st rounder which he isn't. I think we need to work on our O-line and possible pick up a QB with that second round pick we got for Tony, im not saying we should get rid of Cassel but he does need competition which Brody is not going to give him not because Brodie isn't good but Brodie gets hurt too easy so he will pretty much always be a career back up.\",\n",

       " {'text': 'When I entered the Best Buy Theater, I walked past the box office and immediately braced myself as a lanky guy with long shorts, a baggy T-shirt, and a basketball hat trudged toward me with two security guards following attentively. He thrust a leg outward as if stepping over a small fence and smacked an adjacent wall with his fist. I was, for a second, preparing to be starstruck. But no. It wasn’t Tyler, the Creator.\\nAs I stood jotting notes in the lobby, teenagers and 20-year-olds swirled around me waiting for an opener to go on. I searched unsuccessfully for an interviewee as a tiny guy with long shorts, a baggy T-shirt, and a basketball hat tapped me on the shoulder and leaned close as though he had important information.\\n“Just so you know: I’m a little bitch, all right?” He hurried off, and I caught him murmuring to little clusters of people who were, like me, now in the know: He too was not Tyler, the Creator.\\nOn the way out of the theater after the show, a 20-something wearing long shorts, a baggy T-shirt, and a basketball hat walked right up to the coat check and barked something at the attendant. She retrieved for him a skateboard in a plastic bag. This was also not Tyler, the Creator.\\nI was surrounded by hundreds of boys in long shorts, baggy T-shirts, and basketball hats — the unofficial uniform of Tyler, the Creator, and his rap collective Odd Future — all of whom were in attendance to see Tyler and OF’s Earl Sweatshirt perform together. However, after some negligible openers, then Asher Roth, then Raekwon, Peter Rosenberg — the Hot 97 DJ whose birthday was ostensibly being celebrated at this concert — stepped out on stage to solemnly inform the audience that he was going to announce a small change in the lineup. We were not going to see Tyler, the Creator and Earl. Not exactly.\\nAll of Odd Future would be performing instead.\\nThough there are ostensibly a dozen or two members and associates comprising the rap group Odd Future, the two young men at the center of the swirl are unequivocally Tyler and Earl. The blistering ascent of the group and their confusing, intentionally obtuse celebrity rang through the hall on Thursday, the two rappers clearly reveling in each other’s company, finally, and all the funny dissonances of their story ringing through the performance. Earl, now 18 and back from a reform school in Samoa, surveyed the crowd (and as he repeatedly hinted, the prospect of future crowds) hungrily, and Tyler raged — lovingly, in a sense — about Rosenberg’s advanced age and impotence.\\nThe opening rappers and filler DJs are not worth much discussion here: As anyone who’s attended a hip-hop show will affirm, each performed unremarkably and asked, as if on cue, “Does anyone smoke weed up in here?” Yes, the audience would patiently say, we do.\\nAs mentioned, the assonant Asher Roth was the first performer of note, though it was funny for the initiated that he was on the bill at all — he seems not to have moved past Earl’s two-year-old scorching assessment at the beginning of his exceptional debut “Earl“: “I’m a hot and bothered astronaut/crashing while jacking off to/buffering vids of Asher Roth eating applesauce,” referring to an embarrassing clip of Roth drunk on the Internet. It’s a line that can and did visibly drop a jaw.\\nRaekwon followed, and though he always delivers admirably, there was none of the clamor and chorus of Wu-Tang, and too few martial-arts movie samples. Maybe unfairly, I expected the lyrical novelty and camaraderie of the Wu-Tang Clan to precede perhaps their most influenced progeny yet, but Raekwon — again, admirably, and with verve — presented a roster of hits. As dozens of 16-year-olds tried to properly configure the Wu-Tang “W” with their hands, he performed cocktail in hand throughout.\\nWhen Rosenberg reemerged to introduce Odd Future, his tone recalled the awkward, insistent interview he performed with Tyler and Earl in March, on his radio show. His obvious love for the group was constantly overwhelmed, as it was in the interview, by the member’s futzing with microphones, denial of most of Rosenberg’s claims (and sometimes questions), and, of course, incessant insults. But the inelegant rapport between the DJ and the rappers leans heavily on what makes Odd Future’s project truly great: They live to be thorns in the sides of music businesspeople. Or as Jay-Z might say: the music business, people. Their model for art is simply self-design (the design we all know how to perform from Facebook, Twitter, or any number of other social media outlets); anything else is extra, a product of Tyler’s deft manipulation of the hype machine. He’s so good that, as The New Yorker noted, he practically called Steve Rifkind, who’d later offer him a record deal, a pederast via Twitter.\\nIn the Hot 97 interview, Rosenberg goaded Earl about his absence during Odd Future’s ascent: “Were you pissed? Were you annoyed?” But the rapper, and as evidenced last night, the real auteur of the group, knew where Rosenberg was going, and he used the opportunity to be authentic and absolutely prescient.\\n“Yeah, initially,” said Earl, looking around the studio, “but I also go to fuckin’ see that … all this shit isn’t fun all the time.”\\nTyler’s first words on stage recalled the first roar at a hardcore show, and he didn’t bother to pace himself. It was nothing short of beautiful to watch him and Earl interact; even Tyler’s early warning of the unnamable things he would do to New York’s anus landed a smile on Earl’s face. This was so obviously what the two of them have been waiting for — Earl seems to understand Tyler’s lampooning of contemporary rap on a deeper level than the rest of the group, and he bounded around the stage behind Tyler, laughing at his jabs at the audience, at his bandmates, and especially at Earl.\\nThe show exulted the group’s friendship and togetherness from the beginning. Earl and Odd Future hugged and dapped throughout, and the set started off warmly, with a sweet nod to Earl’s return from the opening song, “Couch”:\\nWas always smart-mouthed and quick-witted\\nBut something was always missing, like six digits.\\nIt may or may not have been the nature of a theater in Midtown, but I found none of the terror and mayhem from either their records or public persona on view. They sailed from “Rella” to “Sam Is Dead,” both from their second release as a collective, The OF Tape, Vol. 2, and seemed to delight in each beat coming on, as though remembering, “I love this one!” Tyler stood front and center on stage, certainly in command, though he and the others — even the typically quieter, sheepish Earl — would trade posts to go stomping around the stage like any good rap crew, though more in the style of punk frontmen, or skankers, than rappers.\\nWhen they reached “Earl,” the song that hooked millions of listeners virally in 2010, Earl falteringly took the lead. He held the microphone to the audience for many of the first verses, and even though smiling hugely throughout, was emphatically not Tyler, the Creator when handling the public. Earl does one thing grippingly, live or on record, and that is: rap.\\nWhere Tyler worked the audience, Earl had a blast in the background, observing everything to appropriately determine his next move (Odd Future has no stage decorum whatsoever, and no synchronized formations; the chaos is gripping because of it) and delighting in fits of fist-pumping. And in the middle of “Earl,” I bore witness to a heartwarming, well-earned stage dive. The rhymes from “Stapleton,” also from Earl’s debut, though not performed, resonated even in a mainstream theater:\\nYour rhyme’s rentals — give ‘em back to they owners\\nAt the end of the bar, I spit with the permanence\\nLearn: I’m a curb-stomping person\\nLike third-strike-verdict-dropping, jaw-dropping verses.\\nEven with the cacophony of a theater PA system in effect, Earl’s total dominance of language shone through each song. In the verse from “Stapleton,” he quietly enunciates the lack of rhyme in the first couplet, and during the set, he only briefly lost that incredibly sensitive linguistic surprise, recovered as soon as he understood where the microphone volume had leveled out. Though he performs with a more demure panache Tyler and the rest of Odd Future, it is clear that his style is going to, as he says, proceed “with the permanence.” It’s a delight to see in person: he really is as good as the records.\\nI followed the entire group — Frank Ocean had joined them onstage (though silently) after his performance at Terminal 5 earlier in the night, with only Mike G and Syd The Kid apparently absent — to Williamsburg’s 285 Kent, where they went to see fellow Californians Trash Talk, the hardcore band and Odd Future’s signees. There, out in Brooklyn, was the mood of the records that has captured public attention — a wash of young adults, denimed to the teeth and crammed like bouncing piano hammers under a fog of evaporated sweat.\\nHere, at 1 AM, the influence of hardcore punk and especially horrorcore precedents like Gravediggaz finally oozed out. I walked in with Tyler and Frank Ocean, though they seemed a little nettled, and rightfully so: The crowd began moshing to the set-up music before anyone started performing at all. Tyler and Domo Genesis, however, milked it like veterans as soon as they got on stage. In a sense, the Trash Talk show — replete with audience members diving from five-foot-high speakers, Tyler swinging from pipes on the 20-foot-high ceiling, and dancers accidentally obliterating beer cans and cigarettes — offered the heart of Odd Future’s ethic. Hardcore has long held a resilient place in the trajectory of difficult music. It’s at once dazzling (even though dynamic range is not foregrounded) and sort of stunningly inaccessible: If you can’t spend time in a pit of what appear to be shaved gorillas, try another concert. For instance, the audience spent minutes before the show tossing one of those enormous industrial plastic trash cans — a great visual pun — amongst themselves in the pit.\\nAt 285 Kent, the comments given to me by every interviewee at Best Buy finally shone through: Fans love Odd Future because they are uncompromising; the beats and flair are just a bonus. Trash Talk seared through their set in much the same way, and when they performed a song from The OF Tape, Vol. 2 with members of Odd Future, it blew everyone in the audience to thrashing, laughing shreds.\\nOdd Future will continue to fascinate because they make no compromises for pleasure. Live, they are all pleasure, a group of young people who inspire because they seem simply to do precisely what they want to do, something of a rarity in the lives of young people, much less in the music business. It’s a brutal but ultimately exuberant glossophilia, and the Trash Talk show confirmed it for me: They prefer the clamor of everything at once, even the ugly.',\n",

In a strong bull market, all you really have to do is buy to make money. Traders hunt for stocks that have the best momentum plays.

       " {'text': 'Sonoma Qualifying Report\\nObviously, the crash involving Will Power and Nelson Philippe that occurred early in Saturday’s practice cast a cloud over the rest of the proceedings of the day. Fortunately, neither driver sustained life-threatening injuries although both are likely out of action for the remainder of the season. Will Power’s absence from this afternoon’s race also takes out one of the top contenders for the victory.\\nQualifying went pretty well according to script. The top three cars on the grid are all red cars, with Franchitti taking the pole position and the single point that goes with it to bring him within nineteen points of his teammate Scott Dixon. He nipped Briscoe’s top speed at the last second to move Briscoe over to the second spot, but still on the front row. Helio Castroneves had a surprisingly strong showing, after a couple of lackluster performances had led myself and others to question his focus this late in the season. I should remember that he won this race last year and that Penske usually has a strong showing at Infineon.\\nAnother pleasant surprise was the strong showing of the Andretti-Green Racing stable. Marco Andretti, who won this race in 2006, will start fourth and Hideki Mutoh will go off in fifth place. While they didn’t make the Firestone Fast Six, Danica Patrick and Tony Kanaan both had solid showings in the second round of qualifying with Mutoh edging out his teammate Kanaan in the last few seconds, to take his spot in the Fast Six. Kanaan will start seventh while Danica begins in eleventh place. In a one-race effort, Franck Montagny will start in eighth position.\\nGraham Rahal was impressive in even making the Fast Six since his Newman/Haas/Lanigan team was one of the few teams that didn’t go to Infineon to test. Oriol Servia didn’t fare as well as I had predicted. Plagued with a fuel pump problem, he never made it out of the first round of qualifying and will begin in the seventeenth starting spot.\\nOne of my few predictions that actually did come true was that Scott Dixon wouldn’t fare to well at this race. Of course, the race hasn’t been run yet, but he was never a threat to make it out of the second round and will start in the tenth starting spot. To be fair, I never envisioned his qualifying run to be that bad. I just thought after the scorching pace that he set two weeks ago at Mid-Ohio, that he might come back to earth just a little bit. His crew could find the problem before this afternoon, but I don’t see him winning today.\\nI will still maintain that Ryan Briscoe will be at the top of the podium by the end of the day, with Dario Franchitti running a close second. My prediction for third will be a wild card. I still think that Helio is ready for this roller-coaster season to be finished. I think he might suffer another momentary lapse in concentration, as he did at Mid-Ohio, and finish further back in the field. I have no clue who the wild card will be. It could be Marco, Rahal or someone from the back of the pack. By back in the pack, I don’t mean Milka Duno or Ed Carpenter. I’m not ready to go THAT far out on a limb.\\nI have heard nothing to indicate that the injuries to Nelson Philippe or Will Power are career threatening. Their immediate health is the most important thing, but racecar drivers think about only one thing…when they can get back in a car. Not to minimize Philippe’s career, but this could be a big blow to Power’s career. Here’s hoping that any chance he had with Team Penske in the future isn’t dimmed by what happened yesterday. Enjoy the race.',\n",

Coordination with federal and state agencies is a necessary and integral part of your program.\\nPerhaps the most important part of establishing a much improved economy in Ravalli County is the redevelopment of forest and related industries. In consequence of my career in natural resource management as a Forest Hydrologist (retired) for the U.S. Bureau of Land Management I can address forest management from a perspective provided by over 25 years of field experience supported by 2 graduate college degrees (Soil Science and forest hydrology) and in-service training in soil science, hydrology, and geology. My work experience includes timber sale evaluation for hydraulic impacts, soil survey, riparian management, stream channel reconstruction, and participation in the Montana’s timber sale evaluation program from its beginning.\\nThat National Forest land management in Ravalli County needs to be more pro-active is an understatement. Enhanced management coordinated with local interests via cooperation with the Ravalli county Commission would provide many benefits to the local population.\\nPresent day forest management programs are able to implement timber harvest without impacting water quality. Employing site-specific silvicultural, riparian (for both logging and grazing), road location, drainage, and construction techniques, my experience has been that adverse impacts can be almost totally avoided, and where necessary, mitigated.\\nForest fire hazard reduction, and associated air pollution via removal of dead and dying trees is an issue that should receive a very high ( if not the highest) priority. In any case accelerated fire hazard reduction and the usual timber harvesting will provide many good paying jobs. Reduction in air pollution from removal of fire-prone materials will create a better atmospheric condition in the county.\\nI urge you to move foreword as rapidly as possible with your coordination program.',\n",

       " {'text': 'Google Finally Hosting News On Its Site: Will Newspapers Get Pissed Off At AP Now?\\nfrom the ah,-the-shifting-marketplace dept\\nEarlier this month, we noted that it had been a year since Google had done a deal with the Associated press and there appeared to be nothing to show for it. That led to speculation that the deal really had nothing to do with with some new \"news\" product, and it was really about paying off the AP so it didn\\'t sue Google for linking to AP stories (the way some other news organizations had done). That seemed strange because it was quite difficult to see what the Associated Press or anyone else had to argue about if Google News was providing their news partners more traffic. However, the snickering over a lack of any real project seems to have kicked Google into action, and they\\'ve just announced that they\\'re going to start hosting news content on their own site from the AP and a few other news organizations the company has done deals with. Amusingly, I was unable to find the AP version of this story hosted on Google itself, but did find the Canadian Press version. There don\\'t appear to be any advertisements on the Google hosted version, but there are links to \"related news\" -- which makes a lot of sense. Of course, if I were a publisher partner of the Associated Press, I\\'d actually be really upset by this deal -- but directed at the Associated Press, rather than at Google. This deal is likely to lower traffic to other sites that republish AP reports. So all those partners get no benefit from the deal and actually lose out on traffic. If there are newspapers who want to get upset about Google News, they should get upset at the AP for basically giving a bunch of their traffic directly to Google.',\n",

He and two others gave the introduction to Kelis\\' play about the about the \"eternals\" of Voyager. He rehearsed Kelis\\' new play about the rescue of B\\'Elanna Torres. He accused Kelis of being lazy and told him to let the truth of his story tell the tale, not tricks. (VOY: \"Muse\")\\nThe second chorus was a member of Kelis\\' species and worked with Kelis who was a playwright. He along with two others gave the introduction of Kelis\\' play about B\\'Elanna Torres her adventures on Voyager. He objected to the way Kelis\\' play was to end, telling him that it did not make sense. (VOY: \"Muse\")\\nThe third chorus was an actor who was a member of Kelis\\' troupe of actors that performed a play about the adventures of Voyager with B\\'Elanna Torres as the main character. He would inform Kelis that their patron, the warlord, had been insulted by his enemies to the north and that war could break out. (VOY: \"Muse\")\\nThese two guards served the warlord and guarded him during the plays in the theater. During the final play, they held Lanya who tried to stop the play and to expose the truth about B\\'Elanna Torres. (VOY: \"Muse\")\\nThe warlord had been insulted by Kelis\\' patron, who had offered a dowry that the warlord deemed too small. Kelis attempted to put on a play for the Warlord that would promote peace between the two clans. The warlord became interested in the stories of the USS Voyager that Kelis told him. Kelis was hearing the stories from Torres, and hoped they would make the warlord forget about war with the other clan.\\nWarlord\\'s wife Edit\\nThis woman was the wife of the warlord during the first play of Kelis\\' actors group. She seemed impressed by the play. The warlord later took one of her jewels and threw it to Kelis to pay his efforts. (VOY: \"Muse\")',\n",

       " {'text': '|This article needs to be cleaned up to conform to WikiFur style and standards.|\\nFor specifics, check the and talk page. Consult the Furry Book of Style for editing help.\\nThe concept of Furpile started in 2005; the original plan was for it to be a magazine. What made it special was that it was going to be a magazine made by furs all over the UK, it was going to contain art work, stories and anything else of interest all piled into one furry magazine, hence the name, FurPile Magazine.\\nBut once all the pages for the first issue were ready to be printed, the computer holding it all died and all the information was erased with it. Feeling crushed by this, Dark Racoon and Ollie Pup gave up on the project.\\nIn 2006, FurPile was revived in the form of a radio show, with the help of Tryst, the first episode \"Dave: The Pilot Episode\" was recorded in Guildford, it was uploaded onto the internet, but with little to no hype surrounding it, a second episode was recorded, but the recording lost and never found.\\nAfter that the FurPile Crew disbanded and went their separate ways, but then in 2007, DarkRacoon and Ollie Pup got back together to bring FurPile Radio back, as a low quality podcast recorded in the \"Ollie Pit\" (Ollie\\'s bedroom on his computer). As the episodes progressed, so did the sound quality, each episode getting better and better. They are currently on their 22nd episode as of 20th March 2007 and episode 23 is going to have new microphones and a new recording program and promises to sound much better than previous episodes.\\nThe show hailed from Swindon in the U.K., and was often recorded on the weekends, sometimes helped along by consumption of alcohol, other mental relaxants and food.\\nFurpile Radio has its own forum on the website, which allows users to post their comments for the show\\'s hosts and listeners.\\n2008 saw the introduction of the back episodes to the internet.\\nNormally recorded on Saturday for release Sunday or soon afterwards.\\nThe show had a structured format, starting off with the disclaimer and then a short opening song (or collection of bizarre sounds), then the first segment followed by a song, then another segment, then another song, continuing until the show was finished, usually ending with a song, sometimes with bonus material after the last song.\\nThe show was comprised of several segments, some are every week and others are as and when they happen.\\nThe most common segment that has been on every episode without fail is the \"News\" segment, introduced with the \"news theme\" played in with a different instrument each week, the instruments have been as varied as guitar to a bag of sweets to a spoon against a glass. The theme is a collection of da\\'s followed by the word \"news\".\\nAnother segment was \"DarkRacoon\\'s Interesting Fact\", in which Dark Racooon gave the listeners a fact, usually a completely useless one (and sometimes not even a fact at all).\\nAfter the news there was more than often the \"Sad News\", a segment where the hosts mention the death of a famous person over the week, told the listeners a little bit about that person, how they died and how they were, on more than one occasion, they have never heard of the person in question.\\n\"Reading The E-Mails\" was a laughable segment that occasionally pops up in the show, in which DarkRacoon checked his e-mail inbox, often to find he has no new e-mails; when there is an e-mail, it was to great shock and the e-mail was then read out on the show, whether it be fan mail, or just spam.\\n\"Assassination of The Sun/Tesco\" was a fairly new segment; Dark Racoon and Ollie Pup disliked newspapers, but chose The Sun specifically and find one thing that the newspaper has done wrong in the week and talk about that. When The Sun has done nothing wrong, they \\'assasinate\\' Tesco instead, which employed both Dark Racoon and Ollie Pup.\\n\"Smash S**t Up!\" was the newest segment where the hosts found something they dislike and then smashed it to pieces on air.\\nWhen the missing girl \"Madeleine McCann\" was mentioned in every single shows news story, guest host Kyotas introduced a rule called \"No MIDI no Maddie\", as he always requests that the Legend of Zelda soundtrack be played as background music, but the only files they have on computer for it are MIDI files, DarkRacoon banned MIDI files from being played on the show, so Kyotas said, as long as there is no MIDI files, there will be no mention of Madeleine. DarkRacoon and Ollie Pup often broke this rule when Kyotas was not on the show.\\nStump was a stump of wood, DarkRacoon and Ollie Pup found him on a trip to Cardiff; he was a wise old stump who invented such things as the steam engine and light bulb and also wrote several songs which he got no credit for; he was literally a piece of wood with a face and always gave words of wisdom on the show.\\nMusic on the show was varied - they mostly played rock music, but have also had hip-hop, rap, pop, dance, classical, heavy metal and just plain weird. The background music was comprised of ambient tracks from the likes of The Orb and Future Sound of London or remixes from video games.',\n",

       " {'text': 'Advanced filtering functions for WordPress, including the Talk Like a Pirate Day filters.\\nThe Text Filter Suite (\"TFS\", hereafter) is a WordPress plugin which adds some new text filtering functions. In a sense, the core TFS functions could be considered a \"meta filter\", because they actually provide a framework that let you construct new filters fairly easily. They also provide an easy way to apply filters to post content and comments on a per-post basis.\\nOkay, let\\'s try a real-world example. A common feature on many web sites is the automatic handling of acronyms. You\\'ll often see an acronym such as \"XHTML\" displayed in an alternate style, and when you hover your mouse pointer over it, you get a tool-tip which displays the definition (\"eXtended HyperText Markup Language\", in this case). You don\\'t want to have to type in the markup for this every time you post something, and automation is what computers are for, right? So, there are several plugins available to handle this sort of automated text subsitution.\\nTFS comes with the \"TFS Acronymit\" plugin to perform this function. It\\'s based on Matt Mullenweg\\'s original \"Acronymit\" function, but with a couple of improvements. In Matt\\'s original function, you had to keep the acronym list sorted, longest-to-shortest, and it could get confused by recursive acronyms like \\'PHP\\' (\"PHP Hyptertext Processor\") or GNU (\"GNU\\'s Not Unix\"). TFS Acronymit does not have those restrictions.\\nFor those who think that expansion of technical acronyms is \"teh sux0r\" (i.e. \"boring\"), TFS comes with a variety of more entertaining filters. The current set includes \"chef\", \"fudd\", \"jive\", \"kraut\", \"pirate\", and of course, the aforementioned \"acronymit\". As a word of caution, the \"jive\" and \"kraut\" filters are not what you would call \"politically correct\".',\n",

Follow his timely, provocative writings on the issues of our day.\\nJoin our e-News list to receive our monthly email with new articles from this and other blogs from CTS.\\n- Hits: 2129\\nSitting behind me on the bus to Midway Airport earlier this month were two high school seniors heading home after three days at the University of Chicago. They had been admitted and were now deciding whether to enroll. It didn’t look good for the University of Chicago. The young woman was leaning toward New York University where she has been accepted in the “NYU in Abu Dhabi” program with a full scholarship for tuition, room, and board. An all expenses paid trip in March to visit the Emirates no doubt helped her make her decision. There she will join a freshman class populated primarily by English speaking students from some of the prestigious private international high schools around the world. The young man was holding out for Harvard where he is on the waiting list. His enthusiasm for Cambridge was nurtured by a Harvard summer program for gifted students he attended last year.\\nAs I overheard the conversation behind me during our fifty minute ride I learned a lot about these two young people. She was from an affluent suburb in the New York City area where she attends an extremely competitive public high school, probably not unlike the one I attended in my youth. Her best friend, she reported, was juggling admissions to MIT, Cal Tech, and Stanford. Big incomes and high parental involvement and expectation propelled her and many of her classmates toward the top schools in the country. He, on the other hand, attends a struggling public high school in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. Of the nearly 1,000 in his 9th grade class, less than two-thirds will probably graduate. The rest were either held back or dropped out. But, like a fortunate survivor in the midst of this sea of failure, he had benefited from the life boat of a rigorous advance placement program he described as a kind of school within a school. “You see the other students,” he told his seatmate, “but you don’t really go to class with them.”\\nThese were delightful, hardworking, bright, and thoughtful young people. In addition to their academic accomplishments he tutors struggling students; she is president of the school’s gay/straight alliance. I hope they thrive and expect that they will. But as I looked around the crowded city bus, I couldn’t help but ponder the profoundly uneven playing field on which our nation’s youth compete. The demographics on the bus reflect the neighborhoods between Hyde Park and Midway Airport. There are a few lower middle class communities of well tended bungalows. But they are scattered between the far more prevalent working poor neighborhoods and desperately blighted communities, devastated by foreclosures which have left street after street home to abandoned houses and apartments. African American, Hispanic, and poor make up the principle demographic on the 55 Garfield Local.\\nSome young people from very poor neighborhoods do find their way to the elite colleges and universities. They do so because of hard work and innate intelligence, courageous sacrifices made by their parents, and gifted, dedicated teachers committed to working amid the challenges of our urban school systems. Some do. But very few of the teens I usually see on the 55 Local appear to be headed in that direction. Even if they are, the finances are daunting. When I went to Gettysburg College in the late 1960’s the cost for one year, all inclusive, was well under $8,000. When our son graduated from Gettysburg College in 2004, tuition, room, board and fees for one year totaled over $30,000. Six years later the College now reports the total cost will exceed $50,000 per year. The acceleration of rising costs is staggering. Scholarships and loans can only cover so much. If a good second tier school like Gettysburg costs this much, what is the price of an Ivy League education? (And if you don’t think that matters, take a look at the membership of the Supreme Court. Seven of the nine attended Harvard, Princeton, Cornell, Stanford, or the University of Chicago as undergraduates; eight out of nine attended either Harvard or Yale Law School.) There are, of course, less expensive options, but in state after state tuition costs for public universities are rising dramatically in the face of draconian budget cuts while community colleges struggle to cope with a rapid rise in applicants.\\nThose of us who have done well after beginning life on the high or middle part of the playing field can be tempted to think our achievement is merely a product of our own diligence. Hard work and intelligence certainly was part of it. But let’s not kid ourselves. The field was tipped considerably in our favor. There will always be those who make the best of a bad situation, just as there are some who will make the worst of a good situation. But that shouldn’t blind us to how unlevel the playing field really is for our children.\\nAccording to a recent poll, well over half of those who self-identify as members of the Tea Party movement believe that the government is doing too much for poor people in this country and not enough for the middle class. Is that why Sarah Palin abandoned her job on a modest tax payer dole as governor of Alaska in order to go on the speaking tour where she commands $100,000 per engagement along with a suite and either first class seats or a private jet? At least tax payers no longer have to pay for her rants about government and guns.\\nStill, it’s hard to swallow the rhetoric about the supposed largesse being lavished on the poor. The fact is that for the past decade the government has been handing out huge financial benefits, but they have primarily been going to the very wealthy in tax cuts that have helped to bankrupt the rest of us, including our public schools. Contrary to what the crazy fringe of the aging white male population in this country has been yelling at Tea Party rallies these days, the playing field has been tipping further and further against the poorest of the poor and their schools.\\nRestoring excellence and equity to our public schools will not be easy. But it would be nice, at the very least, if the hardness of heart so prevalent in our public rhetoric these days, whether aimed at the poor or increasingly at their teachers, would be softened a bit by the recognition that intelligence and hard work are not the only things that send some of our nation’s youth to a full ride in Abu Dhabi or Cambridge while others are always facing a field tipping higher and higher against them. The longer we fail to see and deal with it, the further our nation will slide toward a very real and ominous tipping point beyond which there may be no return.\\nMany of our nation’s most prestigious colleges and universities were founded by the forebears of our mainline denominations who eagerly invested in education. Their goal was not to form an elite ruling class dominating commerce and government, but to educate citizens for service in church and society. The ties to those elite schools are mostly gone, but the mission of educating all of our citizens remains. Blaming our public schools today is all the rage. As church people, we must do better. If we don’t cry out against the tipped playing field in our nation’s neighborhoods and schools, who will?\\nJohn H.

       " {'text': 'With events like “The Opening”, the Elite 11, Girdiron Kings, Prodigy Camp and more, the month of July is important in terms of prospect evaluations. With that, we offer a pre-July “rework” of the Top247, with the idea that this list will change a bit between now and the start of preseason camp in August with comments from 247Sports National Analysts Gerry Hamilton and JC Shurburtt.\\nOregon running back commit Thomas Tyner is still among the top 35 prospects in the country for the Class of 2013.\\nHere’s a look at some of the moves.\\nThe first move of note was Oregon running back commit Thomas Tyner sliding out of five-star status.\\n“After continued review, we just don’t believe Tyner is a five-star back. We continue to really like his one cut, homerun speed, however,” Hamilton said.\\nPenn State tight end commit Adam Breneman dropped slightly after suffering a knee injury that will keep him sidelined this year.\\n“Breneman suffered a tough luck knee injury recently that will keep him out of his senior season. That coupled with the moves up by others led to his minor descent,” Hamilton said.\\nAthlete Ricky Seals-Jones moved into the top 30 nationally.\\n“While we don’t believe Seals-Jones will play wide receiver long term, there is no denying he is one of the top pound for pound prospects in the class. His athleticism, versatility and physicality are among the best in the class,” Hamilton said.\\nDefensive tackle Eddie Vanderdoes moves on the cusp of five-star status.\\n“Quickness is an extremely important attribute when you are talking about a 310-pound defensive tackle and at the Eugene Nike Camp, Vanderdoes showed just that. Outside of Montravius Adams, there may not be a quicker defensive tackle off the ball in this class,” Shurburtt said.\\nOhio State quarterback commit JT Barrett dropped slightly, but it was more of a case of others moving ahead.\\n“Barrett moved down slightly, but his move is more of the continued climb of Christian Hackenberg at the quarterback position, and the rise of others. Barrett remains our top dual-threat signal caller in the class,” Hamilton said.\\nPenn State quarterback commit Christian Hackenberg moved on the cusp of five-star status after an outstanding showing at the Las Vegas Elite 11, which reinforced the notion that he’s one of the top signal callers in a class that is fairly deep at that position.\\n“Hackenberg continues to ascend in our minds, and may be the best pure talent of any pro-style quarterback in the class. The more we see of the future Penn State signal caller, the more we think he will climb,” Hamilton said.\\nBaylor receiver commit Robbie Rhodes continued his rise in the national rankings.\\n“The biggest mover in the state of Texas in recent months, Rhodes is one of the most explosive prospects in the country. The recent Baylor commitment not only has exceptional burst off the line of scrimmage, and vertical speed, but he has shown to be as competitive as any when the ball is in the air,”\\nNotre Dame offensive tackle commit Hunter Bivin impressed scouts at the recent IFAF 19-U World Championships in Austin, Texas, and moved up toward the top 50 nationally.\\n“Bivin has been the best prospect in recent days in Austin at the USA football event. Bivin first caught our attention at a January combine, and only continues to ascend in our minds,” Hamilton said.\\nTaquan Mizzell vaults into the top 100 after several impressive camp showings.\\n“Mizzell was tough to tag at the recent NLA National Championships in Brooklyn, N.Y., and has impressed in every camp setting he’s been in,” Shurburtt said.\\nFlorida receiver commit Rodney Adams is a player that we’ve always liked and his showing in Austin just reinforced that in our minds, so he moved into the Top247. If he were not committed to the Gators, several big-time programs that do not normally recruit the Sunshine State, have privately said that they would be “all over” Adams.\\n“Like Bivin, Adams has been a team USA standout in recent days featuring a fluidity and ability to stick the foot in the ground and accelerate that has impressed,” Hamilton said.\\nLSU commit Tre’Davious White continued to ascend and is near the top 100 for the 2013 class. He stood out at the IMG National 7-on-7 in Bradenton, Fla., last week.\\n“White has been a big mover in recent months and continues after a very strong showing last weekend in Bradenton. A big corner with quick feet and turn and run speed, White is expected to continue his rise,” Hamilton said.\\n-Wisconsin defensive end commit Chikwe Obasih made his debut in the Top247.\\nIf you have a question about the rankings or a specific prospect, please leave them in the comments section below and one of our analysts will answer.

       " {'text': '\"Patriotism is a kind of religion; it is the egg from which wars are hatched.\" ~ Guy de Maupassant\\nObam-ney and the Bipartisan Consensus\\nColumn by Faisal Moghul.\\nExclusive to STR\\n\"There is one political party in this country, and that is the party of money. It has two branches, the Republicans and the Democrats, the chief difference between which is that the Democrats are better at concealing their scorn for the average man.\"\\nThe giddy pageantry and mindless political theater of US elections mask the systematic assault on civil liberties and divert attention from the real issues – be it criminalizing dissent under the NDAA, consolidating the domestic surveillance state, assassinating US citizens without due process of law, refusing to close Guantanamo, supporting the Patriot Act, endorsing extraordinary renditions, waging open-ended wars across the globe, engaging in unwarranted saber-rattling against Iran, destroying America’s industrial manufacturing base and persecuting whistleblowers who expose the wrongdoings of their overlords while the country reels under the crushing burden of trillions in debt.\\nThe super-PAC driven American elections are not in any real sense a reflection of the popular will but an illusion of “choice” between two pre-selected spokesmen of the same oligarchy of interests; a periodic public relations stratagem in a managed democracy proffering the voting spectators a false sense of empowerment; the opiate of the “rascal multitude” gripped by Stockholm Syndrome.\\nAs political scientist Thomas Ferguson argues in Investment Theory of Politics, the two-party system largely functions as a mediator among competing business interests. At periodic intervals, powerful “investors” gather to select their next spokesman which, in this election, is a contest between the Microsoft, Citibank, and Time-Warner-sponsored lackey on one hand, and the Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan and Bain Capital-certified pawn on the other.\\nThe old ventriloquist harboring the same agenda is back with a new dummy – the Republicrat: half elephant, half donkey, complete puppet! The correctness of his beliefs or the rectitude of his principles is as irrelevant as the sincerity, or lack thereof, of his purpose.\\nThe Obam-ney paradigm is not concerned with meaningful change, but more about switching to the least objectionable successor – be it the Nobel Peace Warmonger brandishing his “kill list” or the Predator Capitalist Hawk refusing to release his tax records – to preserve the status quo. Grundnorms will not be questioned; meta-rules in favor of the oligarchs will never be challenged. Those who do will find themselves silenced with surprising efficacy.\\nUnlike the seven famous debates between Lincoln and Douglas in 1858, each of which lasted several hours, presidential “debates” in the era of television-based perception management amount to little more than a regurgitation of “conventional pieties” and an affirmation of “necessary illusions.” Moreover, unlike their predecessors, modern day American voters probably do not have the patience or attention span to withstand an hour of pre-packaged, vacuous sound bites. An educated citizenry is no longer a necessary prerequisite to a vibrant democracy; may the elitist-stooge with the most effective propaganda win.',\n",

       " {'text': \"Since 2013 recruiting seems to be coming to somewhat of a close, Notre Dame has been trying to get a jump on 2014 and has been looking for just the right pieces that would fit their program.\\nRecently, the Irish offered two talented prospects from East Lake High School (Tarpon Springs,Fla.) in wide receiver Artavis Scott and offensive lineman Mason Cole, but during that time they've also decided to keep their eye on a gem in the Eagle’s 2015 class, wide receiver George Campbell.\\n“Basically, Notre Dame told me that they would be back to check up on me, but they didn't say when,” said Campbell. “That would be a great school for me to consider, especially academically. Notre Dame is one of the best schools for academics and I think a school like that would definitely help me out later on in life.”\\nLast month his teammates were able to make a Midwest swing to see all the schools that were interested them like Ohio State, Michigan, Michigan State and Notre Dame. After they returned home they shared their experiences with the 6-foot-4, 181-pound freshman, including that visit to South Bend that exceeded their expectations.\\n“I talked to both Tay and Mason about their trip up to Notre Dame,” he recalled. “They said it's a top-notch school that anyone would like to go to. They both said once they went up there they felt like they wanted to commit early.”\\nEverything they told Campbell about Notre Dame made him appreciate the early interest he was receiving from the Irish that much more.\\n“The big thing I'll be looking for is academics in a school,” said the Florida standout. “I'm also going to be looking for a great relationship with the coaches. Kind of like the relationship I have at East Lake with mine.”\\nSince it's still very, very early in the recruiting process for 2015 recruits, Campbell has turned his full attention to helping East Lake improve on last season’s 9-4 record and a loss in the playoffs to the eventual state champ Plant (28-21).\\n“Even though we lost, I thought that was a great game for me personally because I was able to gain valuable experience against a top-notch team,” he shared. “It was a sad that we lost, but were looking forward to getting back to the playoffs again this year and getting even further.”\\nSuccess usually takes hard work and the talented receiver knows if he wants to stand out and be recognized, he has to take his game to the next level. “I'm working to improve on everything in my game,” he said confidently. “I want to make myself a better all-around player for my team.”\\nEven though he has slowed down the recruiting process for the time being, that hasn't kept college recruiters from letting him know they’re interested.\\n“I currently have three offers already from Central Florida, Vanderbilt and South Florida,” claimed Campbell. “I'm also hearing from Alabama, Florida, Michigan, Michigan State, Clemson, Notre Dame and Indiana.\\n“I've already visited Florida and Central Florida so far and I'm hoping to make the trip to South Florida soon.”\\nLike his teammates who have already gone before him, could the Irish expect a visit from Campbell in the future?\\n“If Notre Dame continues to show interest and decides I'm a player they want to recruit, I’d definitely plan on taking a visit up there.”\\nFreshman Cornerback Prepares for Fight Within\\n2015 cornerback Minkah Fitzpatrick (Jersey City, N.J./ St. Peter's Prep) knows that fighting for a starting position in football is no easy task to begin with, but when you have to go up against two seniors with tons of experience it takes that equation to a whole different level. Now add to that problem how hard it would be if one of those seniors was considered one of the top recruits in the 2013 class.\\nWell that's the predicament Fitzpatrick's in at this moment and he wouldn't have it any other way.\\n“I'll be playing cornerback with Tre Bell, who's one of the top cornerbacks in the nation right now,” said the 5-foot-11, 177-pound sophomore-to-be. “Right now, I'm still fighting for a position at cornerback and running back, but I'll definitely be getting a lot of playing time this season. I'm hoping to showcase myself a lot more and I want to start making more game-changing plays.”\\nWith so much talent gracing the field at St. Peter's Prep this season, the future can't help but look very bright and expectations are high.\\n“We've been looking pretty good so far this and I believe we'll have one of the top teams in the state,” claimed the Jersey City standout. “Everybody's been looking pretty focus, so hopefully we'll do a lot better than that 7-4 record this year.”\\nEarlier this summer, Fitzpatrick decided to test his luck against some of the top players from around the country at Florida's Friday Nights Lights Camp in Gainesville. The talented cornerback did more than hold his own and opened a lot of eyes.\\n“I had a really good time and it was a great experience going against a lot of great players,” he said. “After the whole thing was over they had me rated as the 4th overall at the camp. I have already received an offer from Rutgers and I'm also hearing from Alabama, Connecticut, North Carolina and Temple.”\\nThough he hasn't heard from the Irish yet they are definitely on his mind and he's hoping that will all change once they see what he can do on the field.\\n“I haven't heard from Notre Dame yet, but if I do I would be very interested in them,” claimed Fitzpatrick. “I know it's a school that takes pride in their academics and is very good at athletics also. It would be a great opportunity for me because I'd be able to get a great education and play football at same time.”\\nAdversity Strengthens 2015 Recruit\\nTo 2015 prospect Shaun Crawford and his St. Edward (Lakewood, Ohio) teammates it seemed that the end of their 2011 football season was a nightmarish case of déjà vu.\\nFacing their nemesis St. Ignatius on October 29th, the Eagles battled tooth and nail against the Wildcats only to come up on the short side of the stick with the 20-17 loss. The following week they would bounce back by defeating Cleveland Heights in the first game of the playoffs 28-14, but who should they find waiting for them the next week?\\nYou got it, the team that beat them by three points just two weeks earlier, St. Ignatius.\\nAgain the battle would ensue the second time, but fate would play an unbelievable cruel trick on St. Edward.\\nDefeat again to St. Ignatius by the same score 20-17.\\n“They have always been our rival,” claimed Crawford. “They had our number both times we played them last year and then they went on to win state. We're looking forward to playing them again this year and that week leading up to the Ignatius game will always be hectic, but we can't afford to look past anybody on our schedule. We’re going into the season with high expectations. Our coaches always tell us to strive to be great and that's kind of our motto.”\\nThe 5-foot-9, 165-pound freshman has never been one to fold to adversity, so earlier this year the talented athlete suffered a setback that would keep most out of commission, but Crawford had other plans.\\n“I sustained an ankle injury at the beginning of track season, but I pushed through it and our team ended up winning state,” said the dual-sport athlete. “I ran the one-hundred meters in 10.8 and the two-hundred meters in 21.8 with that injured ankle.\\n“That really surprised me that I was able to run that well and I ended up qualifying for state in both events as a freshman. Really it was just crazy. I had to wrap it all the time and take days off practice just to make sure that my ankle was decent enough to run.”\\nThrough that perseverance he has learned that he can do anything he sets his mind to and he's hoping to transfer that experience over to the gridiron. “I feel I need to be more aggressive and gain more strength this season,” admitted Crawford. “I want to gain more speed and play at a faster tempo. I know if I work hard I can achieve that.”\\nThe St. Edward standout will once again play slot receiver this year for the Eagles, but it looks like he will also be playing cornerback on defense. The versatility he shows on the football field has already caught the eyes of a few big time programs that can't wait to see what he'll do this season.\\n“I haven't received any offers yet, but I am receiving plenty of interest,” he said. “I'm hearing from Nebraska, Penn State, LSU and Michigan.”\\nThough he has yet to hear from the Irish, Crawford’s father has already taking the initiative so that his son can experience what Notre Dame is all about.\\n“My dad wants me to go to Notre Dame’s summer camp next year, which I plan to do,” he shared. “Being a member of Holy Cross we talk about Notre Dame a lot at St. Edward. It's definitely a school I'm looking forward to checking out.\\n“You can't go wrong with Notre Dame. I actually went to the Michigan-Notre Dame game last year and it was just crazy. Notre Dame has great academics and my dad, who is a big Michigan fan, always tells me that you pretty much have a job after you graduate from Notre Dame. He says it's not about going pro, it's all about your future.”\",\n",

       " {'text': 'SACRAMENTO -- The San Francisco 49ers on Tuesday scored their first victory in the team\\'s fight with South Bay leaders to wrestle back $30 million in stadium funds, as a judge barred local school districts from spending the money and signaled he may soon give it to the team.\\nThe decision to temporarily put the tax funds under lock and key follows an impassioned public debate over whether the redevelopment money should be used on the Santa Clara stadium or local schools. The judge presiding over the case set a July 27 hearing at which he may rule on the 49ers\\' claim that the team should get the funds because voters had earmarked the money specifically for the stadium.\\n\"This is a powerful argument, and one that may prevail,\" said Sacramento Superior Court Judge Lloyd Connelly.\\nThat would be a stinging defeat for a new oversight board made up of two Santa Clara officials and five officials from boards and agencies around Santa Clara County, from community college districts to the tax collector\\'s office.\\nNo one representing the board spoke at Tuesday\\'s hearing, and the board has yet to hire an attorney.\\n\"We\\'re hoping that the oversight board will appoint counsel to better represent its interests,\" said Orry Korb, an attorney for the county auditor-controller\\'s office who showed up to defend a county official named in the suit.\\nThe saga began June 22, when the oversight board decided to snatch the funds in hopes of spending it\\nBut the team last week filed an emergency lawsuit, arguing that Santa Clara voters approved the funds for the stadium in 2010, two years before the new redevelopment laws took effect.\\nConnelly ended Tuesday afternoon\\'s hearing by granting the 49ers\\' request for a temporary restraining order to freeze the money for at least the next few weeks. The team and the oversight board will now fight over which group is the rightful owner of the funds, and Connelly could rule on the issue as soon as the July 27 hearing.\\nThe team released a statement, calling Connelly\\'s decision Tuesday \"a step in the right direction.\"\\n\"We remain optimistic that when the merits of the case are heard, the court will support the (voters\\') overwhelming decision,\" the 49ers said.\\nConnelly asked the team\\'s attorneys if in the larger scheme of the $1.2 billion project, a loss of $30 million is \"reasonable harm to this project?\"\\nReplied Niners attorney Jonathan Bass: \"It doesn\\'t become ignorable simply by the fact that the (team) has other funds it can access.\"\\nConnelly said he was also concerned that the oversight board may have violated the Brown Act, the state\\'s open-meetings law, saying its hasty decision to redirect the funds raised questions.\\nThe funding is \"of high interest to the community, and there was not a brief general description of, \\'Hey, we\\'re looking to terminate these contracts,\\' \" Connelly said.\\nThe team says the struggle over the money will not affect stadium construction in Santa Clara.

With lots of installer frameworks available for developers, providing an upgrade path becomes a serious concern when shifting to a standard installation framework like Windows Installer.\\nThis article proposes a method wherein the end user can upgrade to the new version though the install engine used is different from the one used to install the previous version. It provides the following advantages to the end user:\\n- Easy migration of the product from a setup.exe install engine to Windows Installer\\n- Retaining configuration which gets lost on uninstall-reinstall procedure\\n- Minimized User time/effort by performing an upgrade\\n- Assumptions:- Setup.exe is build using Installshield IDE.\\nWhile upgrading from a third party installation framework to Windows installer proposes a series of steps(optional, depending on the installer functions and install engine from which the upgrade is happening) that are to be performed in sequence. The steps should be incorporated into the source file of the MSI(new version of the product).\\nThe steps are described below:\\n- Check if upgrade is possible.\\n- Populate install directory\\n- Export Configuration registry entries/keys created by the product into a back up file\\n- Upgrade to an intermediate version of the product which can read the log files created by the older version and store it into a text file.\\n- Uninstall the product with the uninstall string\\n- Ensure the uninstallation has not marked files in use for deletion on reboot.\\n- Read the text file and assign public property values for the new installation\\n- Import the back up files created in Step 3 into application\\'s configuration registries.\\nThe steps mentioned above ensure:\\n- Configuration Information is retained. Configuration Information includes setting environment variables, changing Ini Files, registry settings, modifying XML files, ODBC settings etc.\\n- User selection from the previous installation is acquired for upgrade. It includes all UI properties and public properties required for installing the new version\\n- New files are copied and old files are deleted.\\nTaking an example of providing an upgrade path from Installscript based installation (Setup.exe) to Windows Installer (MSI).\\n- Step 1: The UninstallString registry entry in HKLM\\\\SOFTWARE\\\\Microsoft\\\\Windows\\\\CurrentVersion\\\\Uninstall\\\\<pdt-guid> helps in detecting if a fresh install or an upgrade should happen. The presence of UninstallString is an indication that an upgrade should happen.\\nTo ensure if upgrade is possible, the information retained by the previous installation/upgrade in order to perform native upgrade is required. The information can be in the form of XML, log files, registries etc. If the required data is not present, terminate upgrade. In case of Installscript, the required information is in setup.ilg file in %programfiles%\\\\InstallShield Installation Information\\\\<pdt-guid>. The setup.ilg file is essential to retrieve the installation properties of the previous install. Upgrade proceeds only if the .ilg file is available.\\n- Step 2: Populate the install directory from a configuration entry set by previous installer. This step is required when the install directory cannot be obtained through the native log file.\\n- Step 3: Application generated configuration information will be available in registry entries. User\\'s preferences/settings set through the application should be backed up. If registry entries hold configuration info, then export them. If the preferences are part of ini files or xml files, backup the information in a separate file.\\n- Step 4: Upgrade to an intermediate version of the product. The intermediate version\\'s installer will not install new files or make any changes to the existing installation except incrementing the version. The main function of the intermediate installer is to read the setup.ilg file and write installation information into a file readable by the new installer. The setup.ilg file can be read only by an installer with the same product code. The intermediate installer should be developed for the third party installation framework. An intermediate upgrade is performed to acquire the installation properties for the MSI install.\\n- Step 5: Using the UninstallString acquired in step 1, the product is uninstalled through a Custom Action or function.\\n- Step 6: Remove files installed by the product from PendingFileRenameOperations registry entry if the uninstallation in Step 5 has marked files in use for deletion on reboot. This step ensures that the new files after upgrade will not be deleted on reboot.\\n- Step 7: From the text file created in Step 4, public properties should be set. The installer proceeds like a normal installation with the properties specified in the text file. Install settings are hence restored.\\n- Step 8: After the installation is over, the configuration information/preference set through the application is restored using the backup file created in Step 3.\\nHence the steps mentioned above helps you move to a standard Windows installation from setup.exe. The same approach can also be followed if you have used some other IDE for building the setup.exe, provided you have the path of the file which initially logs(in this case the .ilg file) all the configuration.\\nDisclaimer: As with everything else at Cool Solutions, this content is definitely not supported by Novell (so don\\'t even think of calling Support if you try something and it blows up).\\nIt was contributed by a community member and is published \"as is.\" It seems to have worked for at least one person, and might work for you.

Sometime after 1835, he decided to consult some earlier definitions of despotism, and he turned to the famous Encyclopédie ou dictionnaire raisonné by Diderot, D’Alembert, and others. He copied the definition which he found there into his drafts, but not without a significant amendment.\\n“ ‘Despotism. Tyrannical, arbitrary, and absolute government of a single man.* The principle of despotic states is that a single person ... governs everything there according to his wishes, having absolutely no other laws than those of his caprices.’ Encyclopédie.” To this Tocqueville added: “This was written before we saw the despotism of an assembly under the Republic. *It is necessary to add ‘of a single power.’ ”1\\nThe excesses of the Convention during the Revolution still so vividly reminded Tocqueville of possible legislative usurpations that he felt obliged to add his qualification to the definition of the Encyclopédie. Curiously, however, such an apprehension would rarely appear in the 1840 Democracy. His general distrust of assemblies would surface at least once,2 and on one occasion in his working manuscript, when returning to a specific description of America, he would mention the omnipotence of legislatures there.3\\nBut the final text would delete even this reference to legislative power, and the warnings of incipient legislative despotism which had been so strong in 1835 would almost disappear in 1840. Perhaps in Tocqueville’s mind that tyranny was primarily associated with the democratic excesses of the American states.4 Its relative disappearance may be still another measure of Tocqueville’s shift between 1835 and 1840 from America in particular to démocratie in general.\\nThe second part of the Democracy would discuss the tyranny of the majority, though with an emphasis somewhat different from that of 1835.5 And Tocqueville’s last two volumes would also not neglect the risk of the “tyrannical, arbitrary, and absolute government of a single man.” The 1840 text would revive the idea that there were two ways to be equal, in liberty or in servitude; and one possible master would be identified as the despot. “There can even be a sort of equality in the world of politics without any political freedom. A man may be the equal of all his fellows save one, who is the master of all without distinction.”6\\nFor a time between 1835 and 1838, a particular version of this despot, the military tyrant modeled after Caesar and Napoleon, apparently captured Tocqueville’s imagination. He recognized that, in general, war played a significant role in undermining the liberty of nations.\\n“The first tyrant is about to come; what will he be called? I do not know, but he approaches. What is still lacking for this false image [?] of public order to disappear and for a profound, frightful, and incurable disorder to come into sight? What more is needed for this sublime authority, this visible providence that we have established among us, to trample under foot the most sacred laws, to violate at will our hearts, and to march over our heads? War. Peace has prepared despotism, war will establish it. Not only as a consequence of victory, but war simply by the need for power and concentration that it creates.”7\\nHe added elsewhere: “In order to make war it is necessary to create a very energetic and almost tyrannical central power; it is necessary to permit it many acts of violence and arbitrariness. The result of war can deliver over to this power the liberty of the nation [which is] always poorly guaranteed in democracies, especially newly born democracies.”8\\nBut Tocqueville’s heightened interest in the possibility of the general turned dictator went beyond these reflections on the wider influence of war. As he wrote, he began to develop a particular image of military despotism. Again, Louis de Kergolay probably served as a source of inspiration.\\nDuring the last months of 1836 and the first months of 1837, Louis was in Germany for travel, study, and observation. Alexis, who had advised him about topics worthy of investigation and methods of information gathering, was kept well informed of his progress and reflections.9 On one occasion Louis wrote:\\nI see democracy in the process of advancing not only in France, but also in many other countries. In America you witnessed the spectacle of democracy managing its own affairs or at least having at its head intriguers so dispersed that none were dangerous. But what will we say of democracy if, in Europe, we see it grounding itself in the government of a single person (d’un seul) ...; but we will then find that men have strangely forgotten all the ideas of personal independence about which they have made so much noise. I tremble to see all of Europe in the near future governed in the name of equality by armies and their leaders (hereditary or not), with this duty to maintain order (détail de police) which exists in a regiment, in a classroom, in a prison. After each man, even the least, wanted to be somebody, I picture to myself all turned into small boys that one spanks. Have you noticed how there are demagogues who are very little frightened by this outlook? Many of them are sharp fellows capable of leading their band of disciples to complete equality, of then putting their followers into the hands of whatever government to do with them as it pleases, of getting good positions for themselves, and of saying afterwards to this band: “My friends, you should be content because you are now all equal; now get yourselves out of this by yourselves; good-by.”\\nIt makes little difference to me whether I live in a country more or less democratic; but I feel myself a decided enemy, an enemy by nature, taste, and conscience, of a situation such as I have just depicted to you.10\\nKergolay here described a somewhat different sort of democratic despotism: rule of a nation by the military as though the entire society were a regiment.\\nIn drafts of Part III of the 1840 Democracy, almost certainly written after receiving this letter, Tocqueville mused: “To reflect—if instead of the disordered despotism of the soldatesque, idea already known, it would not be better to introduce here the portrait of a methodical despotism where everything happens with as much order, detail, and tyranny as in a barracks.” And he prophesied reluctantly: “If I were permitted to raise the veil which hides the future from us, I would not dare to do it. I would be afraid to see all of society in the hands of soldiers. A bureaucratic, military organization, the soldier and the clerk. Symbol of the future society.”11\\nHe also observed on one occasion: “The new aristocracy of soldiers is the only one which still seems practicable to me.”12 Even as late as July 1838, a brief outline of the last portion of the 1840 work would include the idea of the “Aristocracy of the men of war.”13\\nBut eventually these visions would be largely shunted into footnotes. Only his general remarks about war opening the door to despotism would survive in the main body of the text.14 His deepest apprehensions would focus elsewhere. By 1840 a renewed dread of administrative despotism (and the rule of clerks) would largely displace his fear of military tyranny (and the aristocracy of soldiers). Nevertheless, Louis’s portrait of military dictatorship would contribute important elements to Tocqueville’s developing image of the Leviathan State.\\nThe final part of the Democracy15 would contain the major portion of Tocqueville’s 1840 observations on despotism. He apparently accomplished most of the work on this important section between July and October 1838, while living at the château in Normandy.\\nOne somewhat puzzling outline of this last segment, dated 28 July 1838, suggested a focus for the entire section quite different from the emphasis of 1840.\\nThis outline, though incomplete, combined themes from several of Tocqueville’s last chapters, but departed substantially from the order in which these ideas would finally appear and concluded by emphasizing a pessimistic vision of social chaos and military despotism. What is most striking about this résumé, however, is the explicit use of despotism as the organizing thread. In 1840 the stated focus of the last section would be the concentration of power; despotism would be the inevitable but (almost) silent companion to the centralized state.\\nSince at least 1831, Tocqueville had worried that the trend toward equality might end in despotism. But between 1835 and 1840, just as he changed his mind about the center of the consolidated power which democracy entailed, so he now envisioned a different sort of despotism. What he had then briefly described, he now thoroughly developed. “I noticed during my stay in the United States that a democratic state of society similar to that found there could lay itself peculiarly open to the establishment of a despotism. And on my return to Europe I saw how far most of our princes had made use of the ideas, feelings, and needs engendered by such a state of society to enlarge the sphere of their power. I was thus led to think that the nations of Christendom might perhaps in the end fall victims to the same sort of oppression as formerly lay heavy on several of the peoples of antiquity.” In 1835 he had specifically cited the tyranny of the Caesars and had prophesied a future of despotisme d’un seul. But now he would declare: “More detailed study of the subject and the new ideas which came into my mind during five years of meditation have not lessened my fears but have changed their object.”18\\nAfter describing how democratic ideas and sentiments naturally favored the concentration of power and the establishment of a unified, ubiquitous, and omnipotent government19 and how various accidental causes exaggerated this tendency in Europe,20 Tocqueville would observe that this multiplication of governmental prerogatives threatened a totally new type of tyranny. “I think that the type of oppression which threatens democracies is different from anything there has ever been in the world before. Our contemporaries will find no prototype of it in their memories. I have myself vainly searched for a word which will exactly express the whole of the conception I have formed. Such old words as ‘despotism’ and ‘tyranny’ do not fit. The thing is new.”21\\nWhat he now foresaw more clearly was the possibility of the dictatorship of the centralized and bureaucratic state. “The social power is constantly increasing its prerogatives; it is becoming more centralized, more enterprising, more absolute, and more widespread. The citizens are perpetually falling under the control of the public administration. They are led insensibly, and perhaps against their will, daily to give up fresh portions of their individual independence to the government, and those same men who from time to time have upset a throne and trampled kings beneath their feet bend without resistance to the slightest wishes of some clerk.”22\\nHis readers would be offered several elaborate descriptions of this New Despotism, including the following chilling portrait:\\nI see an innumerable multitude of men, alike and equal, constantly circling around in pursuit of the petty and banal pleasures with which they glut their souls. Each of them, withdrawn into himself, is almost unaware of the fate of the rest. Mankind, for him, consists in his children and his personal friends. As for the rest of his fellow citizens, they are near enough, but he does not notice them. He touches them but feels nothing. He exists in and for himself, and though he still may have a family, one can at least say that he has not got a fatherland.\\nOver this kind of man stands an immense, protective power which is alone responsible for securing their enjoyment and watching over their fate. That power is absolute, thoughtful of detail, orderly, provident, and gentle. It would resemble parental authority if, father-like, it tried to prepare its charges for a man’s life, but on the contrary, it only tries to keep them in perpetual childhood. It likes to see the citizens enjoy themselves, provided that they think of nothing but enjoyment. It gladly works for their happiness but wants to be sole agent and judge of it. It provides for their security, foresees and supplies their necessities, facilitates their pleasures, manages their principal concerns, directs their industry, makes rules for their testaments, and divides their inheritances. Why should it not entirely relieve them from the trouble of thinking and all the cares of living?\\nThus it daily makes the exercise of free choice less useful and rarer, restricts the activity of free will within a narrower compass, and little by little robs each citizen of the proper use of his own faculties. Equality has prepared men for all this, predisposing them to endure it and often even regard it as beneficial.\\nHaving thus taken each citizen in turn in its powerful grasp and shaped men to its will, government then extends its embrace to include the whole of society. It covers the whole of social life with a network of petty, complicated rules that are both minute and uniform, through which even men of the greatest originality and the most vigorous temperament cannot force their heads above the crowd. It does not break men’s will, but softens, bends, and guides it; it seldom enjoins, but often inhibits, action; it does not destroy anything, but prevents much being born; it is not at all tyrannical, but it hinders, restrains, enervates, stifles, and stultifies so much that in the end each nation is no more than a flock of timid and hardworking animals with the government as its shepherd.23\\nThe omnipresence and apparent gentleness of this new tyranny were two of its most significant features. Unlike despotisms of old, it avoided violence and obvious brutality. But even though mild and benign, it, too, labored incessantly to render entire populations docile; it, too, enervated first individuals and then the entire nation.\\nTocqueville described another important characteristic of the possible new despotism on an extra sheet in his working manuscript dated May 1838. “Show clearly that the administrative despotism which I am talking about is independent of representative, liberal, or revolutionary institutions, in a word of political power; whether the political world is led by an absolute king, by one or several assemblies, whether it is contested in the name of liberty or of order, whether it even falls into anarchy, whether it grows weaker and splits apart, the action of the administrative power will be neither less restrained, nor less strong, nor less overwhelming. It is a true distinction.... The man or the power [?] which puts the administrative machine in motion can change without the machine changing.”24\\nSo the dictatorship of the state was different from and immune to most political changes, even seemingly fundamental ones. In the face of political upheavals the public bureaucracy would quietly continue to gather power and subjugate the nation.\\nBy demonstrating that administrative tyranny did not necessarily mean an end to political confusion, Tocqueville hoped to disabuse many of his compatriots of a popular misconception about despotism. “Idea to introduce somewhere in this chapter, because my contemporaries fear disorder much more than servitude and because to get through to them it is necessary to use that fear. I know that the world in our time is full of people who lightly value human dignity and who would willingly buy, with all the liberty of the human species, the right to sell their harvest in peace.”25\\nPeople who would not respond to appeals for freedom had to be persuaded that their bargain for peace would be a bad one; the oppression which they initiated would be no guarantee of the social or political order they desired.\\nThis insight about the peculiarly insulated nature of administrative tyranny also led Tocqueville to chastise his countrymen for their short-sighted concerns. “When, from the point where the natural development of my subject has led me, I notice all that happens in the world, I cannot keep myself from thinking that men are strangely preoccupied there by secondary interests and that they forget the principal need of the times in which they live. As a matter of fact, it is much less the business of our contemporaries to regulate the exterior forms of the society, to found or destroy dynasties, to establish republics or maintain monarchies, than it is to know if each one among them will retain the most precious privileges of their race and if they will fall below the level of humanity.”26\\nHow far Tocqueville himself had come from his earlier concerns about legislative usurpations or new Caesars! He now saw that the greatest danger in democratic ages came from a much more fundamental trend toward the suffocation of individual liberties by the state, whatever its structural characteristics or its philosophical attachments. “We can quarrel over who will hold the instrument of tyranny, but the instrument remains the same.”27\\nThis subtle ability of administrative despotism to flourish under many different political structures troubled Tocqueville for still another reason. He saw the grim possibility that such an adaptable tyranny could also clothe itself in the outward forms of liberty and rule in the name of the people.28 Of particular concern was the attempt by some of his contemporaries to legitimize centralization by appealing to the sovereignty of the people; they risked falling even more quickly into despotism.\\n“I listen to those among my contemporaries who are the greatest enemies of popular forces and I see that, according to them, the public administration must get involved in almost everything and that it must impose the same rules on all.... To direct, to restrain citizens constantly in principal as well as in minor affairs, such is for them its role. I go [?] from there to those who think that all authority must emanate directly from the people and I hear them maintain the same discourse. And I finally return doubting myself whether the exclusive friends of liberty are not more favorable to the centralization of power than its most violent adversaries.”29\\nSome men apparently believed that popular control, especially through elections, would sanitize the growing power of the state. So they mistakenly encouraged administrative centralization as democratic forms advanced. Tocqueville realized, however, that such procedures would only legitimize the despotism which he most feared.30 Even in 1835, remembering the increasing “democratic excesses” of certain American states, he had observed: “There is nothing as irresistible as a tyrannical power commanding in the name of the people, for while being clothed in the moral strength derived from the will of the greatest number, it also acts with the decision, speed, and tenacity of a single man.”31\\nOn an extra sheet from the working manuscript of the chapter on “What Sort of Despotism Democratic Nations Have to Fear,” Tocqueville finally summarized his forebodings about what later came to be called plebiscite democracy. “We tend toward liberty and servitude at the same time. We want to combine them even though they can not be joined. Not being able to be free, we at least want to be oppressed in the name of the people. Perhaps begin all this part of the chapter in this manner, in a harsh and abrupt manner, instead of letting myself run as I do. We rebel at having a class or a man for a guardian, but we are willing for the state to be one. Provided that one has the right to choose his master, that is sufficient.”32\\nTocqueville had also once written in his working manuscript for the 1835 volumes that “one of the greatest miseries of despotism is that it creates in the souls of men who are subjected to it a type of depraved taste for tranquillity and obedience and a sort of contempt of themselves which end by rendering them indifferent to their interests and enemies to their own rights.”33 But now he wondered whether an elective tyranny might not be less degrading, at least in the short run. There the citizenry could at least embrace the myth that it submitted only to itself. In a gloomy moment, he even suggested in a margin of his 1840 working manuscript that such hollow freedom was all that people in democratic times could expect. “I do not know if, considering everything, this isn’t still the best ... that one can reasonably hope from equality and the only type of liberty it is capable of leaving to men.”34 But such deep pessimism would not last.\\nDuring times of démocratie the road to tyranny seemed alarmingly broad and easy. “As for me,” Tocqueville declared, “I see clearly what must be done to subject the world to tyranny in the name of democracy.”35 And the 1840 text would observe: “The chief and, in a sense, the only condition necessary in order to succeed in centralizing the supreme power in a democratic society is to love equality or to make believe that you do so. Thus the art of despotism, once so complicated, has been simplified; one may almost say that it has been reduced to a single principle.”36\\nTo Tocqueville the successful strategy for any would-be despot or despotism seemed simple: offer equality in return for liberty. As early as January 1837, he wrote: “What it is necessary to do in order to take hold of despotic power among democratic peoples and during the centuries of democratic transitions. Ease of turning democratic passions against their object, of sacrificing liberty to the blind love of equality and to the revolutionary passions that it brings forth.”37 Elsewhere he queried: “What is the danger? To flatter the feelings of hate and democratic envy, and in this way to obtain power. To ladle out equality by the handful; to take liberty in return.”38\\nAs a countermeasure, Tocqueville recommended an ardent attachment to political liberties. Here was the best hope for escaping the New Despotism. “Political liberty is the greatest remedy for nearly all the evils with which equality menaces man.”39 In various draft fragments he explained his position more fully.\\nEquality of conditions, the absence of classes ... are evils you say. It makes human nature smaller, establishes mediocrity in all things. Perhaps you are right.\\nDo you know a way to cure the evil by its opposite, that is by the establishment or even the maintenance of inequality, the permanent classification of men? No, at the very bottom of your heart you do not believe in the possibility of all these things.\\nBut admitting that equality of conditions is an invincible fact, you contest its consequences in the political world; and you blame liberty and you call despotism to your aid; and you seek to assure present security at the expense of future races. And it is here that you are certainly wrong. For there is only Democracy (by this word I understand self-government)40 which can lessen and make bearable the inevitable evils of a democratic social state. 5 September 1837....\\nHow will we be able to understand each other? I seek to live with dignity and honor and you, you seek only to live. What you fear the most from the democratic social condition are the political troubles that it brings forth, and I, that is what I fear the least from it. You dread democratic liberty and I, democratic despotism.\\nMany people consider democratic civil laws as an evil and democratic political laws as another and greater evil; as for me, I say that the one is the only remedy that one can apply to the other.\\nThe whole idea of my politics is here.41 ...\\nI want to make it understood to all that a democratic social state is an invincible necessity of our times.\\nThen, dividing my readers into enemies and friends of democracy, I want to make it understood to the first that in order for a democratic social state to be tolerable, in order for it to produce order, progress, in a word, in order to avoid all, [or] at least the greatest of the evils that they foresee, it is necessary with all one’s might to hasten to give enlightenment and liberty to people who already have such a social state.\\nTo the second, I want to make it understood that Democracy can not give the happy fruits that they await except by combining it with morality, spirituality, beliefs....\\nThus I try to gather together all honest and generous minds under a small number of common ideas.\\nAs for the question of knowing if a similar social state is or is not the best that humanity can have, leave that to God. Only God is able to say.42\\nTocqueville summarized his position in yet another fragment: “Use Democracy to moderate Democracy. It is the only path to salvation that is open to us. To discern the feelings, the ideas, the laws which, without being hostile to the principle of Democracy, without having a natural incompatibility with Democracy, can nonetheless correct its troublesome tendencies and will blend with it while modifying it. Beyond that all is foolish and imprudent.”43\\nThus centralization and despotism were both possible or, as Tocqueville believed at times, even probable results of démocratie. And whatever the possible democratic tyranny, Tocqueville saw centralization as the fundamental cause. Accumulated and unchecked power anywhere carried the seeds of oppression.44\\nDifferent probabilities about the establishment of one or the other of the various types of despotism resulted primarily from the question of who or what would gather power. If the legislature, then legislative despotism; if the people, then tyranny of the majority; if a leader (especially a military one), then despotisme d’un seul (militaire); if the administration or bureaucracy, then the Leviathan State.\\nBut the chances for each of these despotisms also depended on two other major issues: Did the oppression result from the excesses of popular government, or from an effort, despite advancing equality, to resist political democracy? And probably more important, did the example concern Europe or America?\\nTocqueville’s notions of despotism, especially in 1835, seemed essentially to be of two sorts. He began by assuming advancing equality of conditions and reasoned that two basic responses were possible. Social equality might be met with political democracy, that is, with some degree of popular participation, or, more broadly still, political liberty. In that case, the primary danger was excessive power delivered in the name of the whole people to the legislature, majority, or administration. And of these possible democratic despotisms, the most fundamental and threatening, because it usually served as the foundation for either legislative or bureaucratic authority, was the tyranny of the majority.\\nBut the second response, instead of self-government, was a retreat to the authority of some leader who would offer himself as a refuge from the confusion of social democracy. Here the danger was the coming of a tyrant in the name of order. Some of the democratic despotisms described by Tocqueville arose from the coupling of political and social democracy, and some from a frantic effort to escape the political consequences of advancing equality.\\nThe other important question about possible tyrannies involved the setting; was the Old or the New World meant? America had a peculiar but strong bias against powerful executives. And, as Tocqueville repeatedly made clear in 1840, the United States was also largely immune to several factors which hastened the coming of the Leviathan. In the New World, therefore, despotisms other than administrative or individual seemed more likely, at least for the near future. Tocqueville believed that the immediate danger in America was rather majoritarian tyranny, particularly as exercised through the state legislatures.\\nIn Europe, however, a different fate threatened. Especially in France, the traditions of administrative centralization and Bonapartism enhanced the probability of other democratic despotisms. So what most frightened Tocqueville when he considered the future of his own country in 1835 was despotisme d’un seul and by 1840 the centralized and bureaucratic state.\\nThe basic trend of Tocqueville’s thinking between the early 1830s and 1840 was toward an ever greater focus on administrative despotism. The 1835 text offered a theory and even the beginnings of a portrait of such a tyranny, but the 1840 volumes presented a fully developed vision of the New Despotism of the state. By 1840 Tocqueville’s image of the Leviathan, especially for Europe, had eclipsed most of his other notions of democratic despotisms. Just as his attention turned increasingly from the more “American” despotism—majoritarian—to the more “European”—bureaucratic—so too his entire book shifted, between 1835 and 1840, from what was more concretely American to what was more theoretically “democratic.”\\nTwo other special changes in emphasis also occurred between 1835 and 1840. The first half of the Democracy stressed the despotisms of the society as a whole (the people or the majority) and the more traditional governmental or political despotisms of the assembly or the tyrant. The second part emphasized instead a novel vision of the democratic tyranny of the state. The concept of the Leviathan was not new with Tocqueville, but his idea that démocratie especially fostered this particular kind of oppression was much more original.\\nMoreover, Tocqueville in his 1835 volumes was still seeking to identify the potential agents of despotism in democratic societies. But by 1840 his thinking had pushed far beyond these earlier anxieties. He had now come to believe that the relentless concentration of power in the hands of the public administration was a far more fundamental threat to liberty than any potential usurpation of democratic authority by legislatures, factions, military heroes, or other individuals. By 1840, the threat of the New Despotism had, in some senses, made his concern about most other possible democratic tyrannies somewhat beside the point.\\nStill another measure of the link in Tocqueville’s mind between centralization and despotism in democratic times was the almost identical list of remedies which he offered for both. Although the 1840 volumes presented a somewhat more detailed political program, both halves of the Democracy made essentially the same recommendations for combating these twin dangers of democracy. Among the many possible antidotes prescribed in his book, Tocqueville especially urged local liberties, freedom of association, liberty of the press, an independent judiciary, and individual civil and political rights.45 The ultimate check on any threatened democratic despotism, he still insisted, rested with the opinions and moeurs of a people.46 Once again the crucial nature of moeurs in Tocqueville’s thinking was underscored.\\nAt times during the making of the Democracy, as Tocqueville reflected on the threat of the various democratic despotisms, he was driven almost to the point of despair. Sometimes he “trembled” for liberty;47 sometimes he gave himself over to the idea that a sort of hollow, symbolic freedom was the best that democratic nations could expect. He reluctantly recognized that in many ways démocratie was more compatible with tyranny than with liberty.\\nBut ultimately he backed away from such pessimism. He could not bring himself to believe that the prognosis, even for France, could be so bleak as to make despotism an almost inevitable result of advancing equality. Once again, personal moral presuppositions about human freedom and the benevolence of God led Tocqueville to the side of hope.48\\nOne of the abiding attractions of Tocqueville’s work is the gallery of despotisms which he presented as the possible results of démocratie. Particularly for his contemporaries, one of the more intriguing of his ideas was the assertion that what men had to fear from democracy was not anarchy—the collapse of authority and social and political disintegration—but despotism—the gathering of all power into the hands of some symbol of democracy, whether the majority, the legislature, a leader, or the state itself. For the twentieth century, his fears about bureaucratic regimentation and militarism and his visions of plebiscitarian “democracy” and the Leviathan state have proved only too prophetic. As a draft of his 1840 volumes put the dilemma facing modern man: “Two questions to resolve. Despotism with equality. Liberty with equality. The whole question of the future rests there.”49\\nDemocracy, the Individual, and the Masses\\n[1. ]“Rubish of section 4 entitled: ‘What [Sort] of Despotism Democratic Nations Have to Fear,’ ” Drafts, Yale, CVg, “Rubish,” tome 4; cf.

       " {'text': 'add to cart\\nRead an excerpt\\nSeductress is a new take on history\\'s great enchantresses. Demonized and trivialized for centuries, the seductress has been stigmatized as either a shark-hearted vamp or brainless blonde bombshell. She is one of the most discredited female figures in Western culture.\\nThis first-ever treatment of the subject tells a different story. Real seductresseswomen who conquer and keep the best menexplode all the stereotypes. Contrary to popular fable, these charmeuses were exemplary women of high achievement. Strong, smart, and self-realized, they combined erotic conquest with personal and vocational success, and practiced a sophisticated amorous art that\\'s relatively unknown.\\nEach chapter targets a different myth and tells the colorful stories of six kinds of seductress: nonbeauties, seniors, intellectuals, artists (not muses), and two commanda typesgovernmental leaders and high-octane adventuresses. Some of these fascinators are familiar like Cleopatra, Lola Montez, and Wallis Simpson; others less so, like the celebrated Edwardian pianist Violet Gordon Woodhouse who lived in a life-long ménage a cinq with four devoted \"superhusbands.\" In every case they defy conventional beliefs.\\nRarely beautiful or young, they were daring renegadesindependent, autonomous, ambitious, \"unfeminine,\" and confident. And they employed a long-forgotten erotic art that upends all the pop how-tos. Instead of using coy, servile maneuvers, they enthralled men with their characters and a lovecraft based on ancient, timeless techniques. These are ninety percent psychologicalmindspells woven of wit, drama, joie de vivre, difficulty, deep ego massage, and people savvy. The women who captivated men for life and beyond used their heads and imaginations, not their cleavage.\\nAmid the current \"plague years\" in female sexual power, seductresses provide welcome relief. Through their inspiration and love wisdom they can help women reclaim the fieldjunk the pretty power propaganda, dial up their personality and inner charm, and capture the men of their choice. They show women how to get their swerve back and recoup their birthright of sexual sovereignty.\\nMen, too, will prosper. The seductress is a man\\'s ideal dream woman; she\\'s the best thing that can happen to him, conferring growth, creativity, and authentic masculinity. Seductress is win-win for both sexes, a celebration, a manifesto, and a thinking woman\\'s how-toa master plan for full female entitlement in the twenty-first century: women in charge erotically and professionally, holistic happiness, and the best men under their spell.\\nBetsy Prioleau has been a scholar in residence at New York University and a professor at Manhattan College. She is the author of Circle of Eros: Sexuality in the Works of William Dean Howells.\\n- Why do you think ancient patriarchal cultures like Sumer and Athenian Greece tolerated such unruly sex goddesses?\\n- Of the six classes of seductressfrom plain sirens to adventuresseswhich group had the greatest obstacles to overcome? What were their weapons of choice and why did they work?\\n- Pick two seductresses at randomLola Montez and Minette Helvetius, for exampleand analyze how they did it, using the Art of Love precepts in chapter one. What did they leave out? Contrast the two approaches.\\n- Many of the seductresses in the book were androgynousunfeminine types with male interests and qualities. Discuss this paradox. What makes \"masculine\" women seductive and why?\\n- The philosopher Søren Kierkegaard thought seduction necessary for all worldly enterprises. \"A man who cannot seduce men,\" he said, \"cannot save them either.\" How useful is this for women in the workplace? Can women deploy some of these erotic strategies nonsexually as Elizabeth I and Catherine the Great did to lead more effectively? Where does this shade into sexual harassment?\\n- From the beginning, mainstream Feminism has been antagonistic to sexually successful women. Examine this phenomenon. Explore the puritan roots in the movement and the issue of sexual rivalry.\\n- Some civilizations are more receptive to the seductress than others. For example, a disproportionate number of seductresses in the book are French, a culture steeped in sexism. How is America either good or bad for seductresses? Why?\\n- Conversation is one of the most consistent and powerful aphrodisiacs used by the great seductresses. What were the components of their conversational magic? Can we retrieve them today? How?\\n- Based on the stories of history\\'s top enchantresses, construct a twenty-first-century master plan to recoup female romantic primacy in an age of online dating, hook-up/break-up relationships, beautymania, and the banalization of sex and love.\\n- Who are the seductresses today? What are their chief allures and strengths as contrasted with those of the past? What are the barriers now preventing women from being seductresses?\\n- If seductresses are such exemplary women, why were they demonized through the ages? If men loved them so much, why did they persecute them, and why did women join them?\\n- Compare and contrast two opposite seductresses, such as Lou Andreas Salomé, who wore no makeup and discussed philosophy, and Cora Pearl, who overdressed and traded in jokes and small talk. What qualities do they share in common?\\n- Seductresses are known by their ability to get and keep the best men. Define this \"best\" man. What do women really want in a mate? Once we have sexual choice, do we choose well or poorly like Wallis Simpson?\\n- Many of the seductresses suffered persecution and/or social exclusion. What are the qualities necessary to survive as a seductress in the face of prejudice, envy, and the spite of lesser men.\\n- Discuss the role of media, popular culture, compulsory education, and religious or moral indoctrination today with respect to female sexual autonomy and power.\\n- For all of recorded history men have been perceived as the stronger, sexier sex. Examine the truth of this belief in the light of the stories of the seductresses.\\n- Can you track any changes in seductresses over the centuries? If so, can you spot any constants in the personalities and strategies of these mancharmers? Are women as seductive now as in the past?',\n",

In March of 2006 I hired myself to focus on our money: tracking it, spending it more purposefully, and finding new ways to save it. This blog documents those efforts.\\nWhile these activities weren’t actually new to me, documenting them certainly was. And calling myself and this blog “The Family CEO” gave me a new way of thinking about my role. It made me more purposeful and gave my efforts more meaning.\\nEventually I expanded the blog to include other topics such as organizing and simplifying. Basically anything that I’m passionate about that relates to the running of a household is fair game. You’ll find a complete category list in my sidebar.\\nIn addition to being the author of this blog, I am a wife, mother of two, and part-time bookkeeper/office manager. My formal education includes a degree in Business Administration, which probably explains where the “Family CEO” idea came from.\\nIf you’d like to get a feel for what The Family CEO is all about, you can start here: Sitemeter and Google tell me that three of the most popular posts in this blog are:\\nI invite you to subscribe to The Family CEO, either by email or in a reader, so that you can be notified with new posts are added.

       " {'text': 'There are designer dresses, handbags, even dogs, but now there’s a new trend: designer pigs. That’s right, celebrities like Paris Hilton are now carrying around pigs in their Louis Vuitton purses, but they’re not the 50-pound porkers you’d see on the farm. They’re “micro” or “teacup” pigs, specially bred pigs that stay the size of piglets through their adult years.\\nCranston residents Victor Kinoian and Justin McHugh are hoping to jump on the bandwagon and put some cash into their piggy banks by breeding and selling the newest wave of designer pets. Their business, called My Pet Piggy, LLC, and is just getting off the ground, and is still in the earliest phases. In the spring, Kinoian said he’ll set up shop on a farm in Hopkinton, where he’ll breed and sell the small pigs to savvy pet owners.\\nRight now, Kinoian is just getting his feet wet – he currently has five micro pigs that he’s treating as pets in order to learn about the care and behavior of the animals. But he didn’t just jump into the business blindly. Kinoian has been researching these miniature pigs for many years, and just got his first one several weeks ago.\\nThe pigs, which range in color from white and pink to brown and black, can weigh anywhere from 15 to 35 pounds when fully grown. That’s about the size of a Cocker Spaniel. Kinoian said the smaller the better, as the tiniest pigs go for the largest sums of money.\\n“Fifteen pounds is extremely lucky,” he said.\\nA pig is considered “miniature” when it’s anywhere under 35 pounds. Most of the pigs they own right now are well under a year old; at about 6 months, Kinoian said the pigs are half their adult size.\\n“Micro” or “teacup” pigs are genetically engineered, and haven’t been around for too long. Kinoian said the trend started in Europe several years ago, when they started breeding the smallest pigs from each litter. The process continued until they ended up with these permanent piglets.\\nKinoian said he plans to do the same thing come the spring, and is working with another breeder to obtain the highest quality pets.\\nThough they’re cute and compact, these pigs aren’t for everyone.\\n“They’re like babies,” said Kinoian. His first pig, Tank, a 4-month-old the size of a Yorkie, has become attached to him. It recognizes Kinoian’s smell, and prefers to be held by him. Unlike a dog or cat, pigs can only be held one way: cradled like an infant. Otherwise, they squeal, a piercing noise of distress.\\nThe pigs Kinoian plans to sell will be spayed or neutered and litter box trained. Pigs can also be leash walked outside, like a dog. Kinoian said they eat a healthy diet of veggies, though they can also eat feed from a farm supply store and the occasional Cheerio will never hurt them.\\nKinoian said he is still learning about bath time, a process the pigs don’t enjoy much. Despite stereotypes, the pigs don’t carry an offensive smell. In fact, some smell quite lovely, depending on what type of lotion you use; pigs need to be moisturized because their skin dries out.\\nAnd don’t forget to pamper them, because pigs are extremely smart. Kinoian said pigs are just behind chimpanzees and dolphins on the list of smartest mammals. It’s their intelligence, he said, that prohibits their owners from getting away with hastily handling them or switching up their routines.\\nApart from their unique needs and high IQ, pigs are like other pets. They interact well with other animals, and Kinoian’s two pit bulls get along well with the five pigs sharing their home. Usually, the pigs are pretty quiet, squeaking out only the occasional squeal or snort. Cross them and they will nip, but not to injure, just to warn.\\nPigs aren’t like cats or dogs, and because of this, Kinoian is only taking serious inquiries from those that have done their research.\\nThe asking price is another hurdle. Kinoian said most pet pigs on the market go for somewhere between $1,000 and $3,000. However, the guy behind My Cousin Piggy plans to sell his pigs for $950 to $1,200.\\nIf you’re considering pig ownership, it’s important to check your local regulations. Some cities and towns in Rhode Island prohibit pig ownership, like Providence. But most don’t have laws on the books, said Kinoian, since micro pigs are such a new fad.\\nTo find out more about My Pet Piggy, e-mail email@example.com.',\n",

       " {'text': 'Well, the big day was yesterday. The 60 something birthday and the day the snow was predicted to arrive. Isn’t that typical, you sit here Christmas day hoping for a blanket of white and it arrives in mid January when you don’t want it.\\nJu had tried the sign of the cross to ward off the evil of an early start but as I was expecting a flood of visitors laden down with gifts I wanted to get back from the shopping. The reason for shopping on a Friday, blame Ju since she decided to start horse riding on a Saturday at one stage. OK, I admit that’s changed now but the shopping expedition seems to have stuck.\\nI woke her at 7 am with a cuppa, a warning that we had half an hour before leaving and that there was a smidgeon of snow on the ground. I backed out of the bedroom to ensure I could see any missiles heading in my direction. My coffee was in the lounge where I’d given all the girls a yoghurt drop as a treat. Ju cowered in her bedroom afraid to venture out in case she had a fit of conscience at not giving the girls their early morning outing on the settee. In fairness, I’ve told her if she wants to do it I’ll get her up at 6.am\\nI gathered the shopping bags, my list and the all important lottery pouch., brought Ju’s handbag through to the hall and said goodbye to the girls. Off we set. The winds of Siberia were howling around the front door and the smidgeon had become a couple of inches and it was still coming down. After what felt like a three mile trek to the car which is 50 feet away we hauled ourselves in and set a’shivering while waiting for the heater to kick in. The wipers took the worst off the screen and away we went.\\nLiving by the coast has it’s benefits one of which is that snow rarely sticks here. I guess no-one was listening as I shouted a reminder to the gods. The coast road was still fairly clear and it had obviously been salted. We made good time to the supermarket arriving just before they opened at 8.am. The heater hadn’t done a fantastic job as some fool had opened the window to smoke. ahem. moving rapidly on……. I got out and walked stiff-legged to where the shopping trolleys were parked. I put in my £ coin and tried to pull mine away from the rest. After a few minutes trying I went to borrow an ice axe to separate them then shot into the warmth of the store.\\nOur routine is that Ju goes off to buy the lottery tickets and her paper then while I go round the store to shop, she sits and has a coffee till I’m in the queue at the till when she comes to help me pack.(If she sees me. I have pointed out that she stands a better chance if she actually faces the tills). Three quarters of an hour later I’m done and ready for a coffee and a diet conscious, diabetic, toasted sausage sandwich with brown sauce. Mmmmmm. As I’m sitting there Ju tells me Yvonne has phoned and won’t be able to get through because of the white stuff and her sister has phoned and said the same. Heavens above, what’s the matter with these people. Mu and John only live 40 miles away at the bottom of a valley with about 4 mountains between us. No-one makes an effort anymore. Looking out the window convinces me that maybe the gods are making an effort because the car is fast disappearing.\\nWe’re on our way home when I remember that I promised to visit ‘our’ cafe Let me Tempt You, to take a pair of earring to one of the girls. When I mention it to Ju her lip seems to curl. I think it must be the cold contracting her muscles. We arrive home safely and the snow is sticking . We unpack and I say ” would you like a coffee sweetie”? “Yes please babe” is the response. “Grab your coat then and let’s take these earrings to K….”. I hear a growl and almost think there’s a dog handy but my beloved knows it’s my birthday and is humouring me. Borrowed tennis racquets on our feet we struggle back to the car. I try breathing on the lock to getthe key in but my nose sticks to the side of the car. Afraid Ju will drive off with me in this position I tug and take the skin off the tip off my nose. Oooh, that stings.\\nThe Coast Road is still accessible and we make it safely to the cafe. K… looks up in surprise and said she didn’t expect to see us in view of the weather. I just say a promise is a promise. I’m renowned for my wisdom. Ju makes a comment about buying me my birthday drink and she head off to order while K… selects the earrings she wants. Leaving K… smiling happily I go to join Ju who has found us a table…….ha, 40 tables, 3 customers, how hard that must have been, and sit. I am no sooner ready to take my gloves off than the tray arrives with two of the staff who start to serenade me “Penblwydd Hapus i chwi. penblwydd hapus…..Dear David……..” I’m cringing and trying to crawl into my boots as everyone is looking and of course the next four customers in sat just behind me. I’m given a lovely card and a sweet little gift as well as a free coffee. Ah, and Ju must be warming up since the mouth seems to be grinning.\\nWe came home about 11.30 and spent the rest of the day wrapped up warmly indoors. It carried on snowing.\\nPoor Ju was unwell and had to go to bed about 4.pm but it was not snow or shopping trip related. This morning she seemed a little better and the snow has stopped. They say we’ll have another little flurry than it should clear over the next few days but it’s going to be cold, verrrry cold with icy blasts in the minus. Maybe we can hibernate for a while. Oh, a phone call to say my next birthday is tomorrow when Yvonne and Ugo are going to come then another early next week when Mu and John come. Then the following Sunday when my nieces turn up. I quite like the idea of Official Birthdays and unofficial ones to follow.',\n",

Gordon about this time made an ineffectual effort to escape. On 3 Nov. Charles extended the reprieve for a month, and a fortnight later again wrote ordering Gordon to be examined by torture. This command was immediately obeyed, but Gordon on being brought to the council chamber, 23 Nov., either ‘through fear or distraction, roared out like a bull, and cried and struck about him so that the hangman and his man durst scarce lay hands on him,’ and at last fell down in a swoon. On recovering he named several of the royalists as among the plotters, as some thought from madness or out of design. The Earl of Aberdeen, then chancellor, however, befriended him, and he was remitted to the care of the physicians. For greater quietness they sent him to the castle of Edinburgh. On 13 Dec. his case was again before the council, when, as it was thought that the execution of a man in a state of insanity would endanger his soul, he was reprieved until the last Friday of January 1684. His execution was once more deferred, and on 8 Aug. 1684 the privy council sent him to the Bass Rock, but brought him back to Edinburgh on the 22nd to confront him with Spence, and a resolution was taken by the council on this occasion ‘not to admit of his madness for an excuse, which they esteemed simulated.’ On the 30th he was caught in the act of making another attempt to escape from the Tolbooth of Edinburgh. The council debated whether on account of this aggravation of his crime the day fixed for his execution, 4 Nov., should not be anticipated. But it being found that the breaking of prison was not an offence punishable by death, this could not legally be done; so on 20 Sept. they ordered him to be removed to the castle of Blackness.\\nGordon's imprisonment in Blackness was voluntarily shared by his wife, and some of their children were born there. It continued until 5 June 1689, though on 16 Aug. 1687 he was recommended to the king for a remission by the Scottish council. His employment during his confinement consisted in wood-carving and the study of heraldry. Some of the carvings were illustrations of events of his own times and family history.\\nThe Earlston estates were restored to Gordon after the revolution, and he and his family returned thither on leaving the castle of Blackness. But his losses were such that the estate had to be sold or heavily mortgaged. In February 1696 Gordon's wife died. Three covenant engagements into which she entered during her sojourn in Blackness Castle and her later life were printed after her death, entitled ‘Lady Earlston's Soliloquies.’ They have been reprinted by the Wodrow Society at the end of the first volume of ‘Select Biographies.’ She and her husband both corresponded with the covenanting preachers Renwick, Cargill, and Cameron, nine letters to them by the ministers named being printed in a collection of Renwick's ‘Letters.’ Gordon married in 1697, as his second wife, Marion, daughter of Alexander, viscount Kenmure.\\nIn 1718 Gordon lost his younger brother, Sir William Gordon of Afton, who had distinguished himself in the Prussian army, had aided Monmouth, and had been made a Nova Scotia baronet, 29 July 1706, for his services to William III at the revolution. Sir William Gordon seems to have redeemed Earlston from a family who had purchased it, as he obtained personal sasine in these lands in 1712. He died without issue, and both his title and his estates of Afton passed to his elder brother.\\nGordon died at Airds 11 Nov. 1726, and was buried in the churchyard of Dalry. By his first wife he had issue thirteen children, and by the second two. His son Sir Thomas succeeded, and the family still flourishes in Kirkcudbrightshire.[Lord Fountainhalls Historical Notices of Scottish Affairs, 1661-8 (Bannatyne C'lub), i. 333-453, ii. 458-817; Decisions, pp. 238-300; McKerlie's Hist. of the Lands and their Owners in Galloway, iii. 423-30, iv. 77.]\\nGORDON ALEXANDER, second Duke of Gordon (1678?-1728), son of George, first duke of Gordon [q. v.], and Lady Elizabeth Howard, eldest surviving daughter of the sixth Duke of Norfolk, was born about 1678. He was educated in the catholic faith and retained the family attachment to the Stuarts. On 31 Aug. 1715, on the eve of the rebellion, while he was yet Marquis of Huntly, an ‘Act for encouraging loyalty in Scotland’ received the royal assent. The design was to obtain security for the good behaviour of suspected persons, and summonses were issued to Huntly and others to repair to Edinburgh and give bail for their allegiance to the government, under pain of a year's imprisonment and other penalties. Huntly failed to appear, and proclaimed the Chevalier St. George at Gordon Castle. On 6 Oct., with three hundred horsemen and two thousand foot, he joined the Pretender's standard at Perth, and was at the battle of Sheriffmuir, after which he returned to his home at Gordon Castle.

Of the two, the common turkey is classed as a game bird and hunted seasonally, as well as being the only wild bird successfully domesticated by man in the Western Hemisphere.\\nThe common turkey is a large bird, with males (called \"toms\" or \"gobblers\") up to 50 inches long and weighing up to 22 pounds. They bear iridescent dark bronze and green feathers, a large feather tassel on its breast, and a warty, red head with a fleshy ornament extending over the bill. Females (\"hens\") are a fader shade of brown, and about half the size of the males. The domesticated variety is commonly white, and being bred for its meat, considerably heavier.\\nOcellated turkeys are smaller than their northern counterparts, with brightly-tipped feathers and blue-skinned heads with yellow bumps, as well as a yellow crown above its bill wattle.\\nA Mexican subspecies (M. g. gallopavo) was first domesticated by pre-Aztec people, who had started penning the birds around 800 B.C. According to studies published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, the turkey was first domesticated for their feathers, which were used as adornment or in ceremonies and rituals; this in turn was copied by the Anasazi in what is now the southwestern United States around 800 B.C. It was around 1100 A.D. that the birds were first used as an important food source by ancestors of the present-day Pueblos. Europeans first saw the domesticated turkey when the Spanish arrived in Mexico in 1519, and a short time later a number of these bird were taken to Europe, where they spread to farms throughout much of the continent. It was the English who brought back their domesticated version to the American colonies in the early-17th century, where they eventually became a staple of the diet, and the symbol of the Thanksgiving holiday.\\nThe name \"turkey\" was first applied to the bird in England, a transliteration of the name then applied to the guinea fowl (Numida meleagris) of Islamic, or \"Turkish,\" lands in northern Africa.',\n",

       " {'text': 'Every person dreams of having a beautiful smile and healthy teeth. A beautiful smile is a proof of your health and sometimes your welfare. If you have any problems with your bite or teeth it is recommended to begin treating or perform prevention from early childhood in order to avoid the problems in the future.\\nImproperly aligned teeth and bite cause different problems with chewing food, with the gastrointestinal tract, with breathing, and many other problems. That is why it is very important to straighten teeth and to fix bite as soon as possible. But unfortunately, a great number of people in the world suffer from these problems.\\nAn uneven bite and crooked teeth are the results of hereditary and genetic anomaly, as well are connected with problems with maturation, pernicious habits in childhood. Sometimes teeth may be too big for a jaw and begin to grow in a wrong way. Crooked teeth may lead to appearing some diseases: headaches, diseases of ears, throat, nose, stomach and many more. People with crooked teeth usually do not have clear diction. Moreover, such teeth can be easier destroyed because pieces of food stuck between them promote the development of caries. Crooked teeth make your smile not attractive, while the smile is important for communication and success.\\nIf recognized and treated in early childhood it is much easier to improve the situation and to prevent the improper bite and crooked teeth with the help of some exercises, gymnastics and to normalize nutrition and breath, in other words to eliminate the disorders without expensive treatment and special devices. But adults who wish to solve these problems should use a special therapy and proper combination of treatment. Many of them apply for bracets usage.\\nBracets are a line of little locks that are attached to the teeth with the help of special orthodontic glue and are fastened by a stainless steel wire that puts pressure upon the teeth and straighten them. There are different types of bracets according to the material they are made of and the way of fastening on the teeth. Sometimes bracets usage can be at the outer side of the teeth, but many patients prefer the bracets to be invisible for other people and they have them fastened at the inner, lingual side of the teeth. Such bracets are called lingual bracets.\\nBracets usage has become very popular last decades, especially between young people. New technologies allow producing bracets from different materials: stainless steel, plastic, sapphire, gold, and ceramics. In the United States more than 50% of pupils and students wear bracets. Patients can select the material for their choice, they can order any color of wires. If a patient needs the bracets usage, his age is not important. Usually the period of treating may consist from six months to several years, according to the level of the deformation.\\nIt is very easy to take the bracets off. This process is painless. After removing the surface of the teeth should be polished and remineralizating therapy takes place to achieve better results.\\nThus the bracets usage is easy and wide spread in the world. Many stomatologic clinics and centers may offer their services to those who need this kind of treatment.',\n",

       " {'text': '… And God Created Gisele\\nBounding down the stairs of her Greenwich Village town house to greet a visitor, Gisele Bündchen commands the shock value of a close encounter with a giraffe: you can hardly believe an earthly creature is built this way.\\nEverything about her is so elongated and slender—those impossibly attenuated limbs! the swanlike neck!—that she seems almost preposterous, like a cartoon figure. Nearly six feet tall by the age of 13, she spent her childhood being teased by classmates who called her Olive Oyl.\\nBut Popeye’s rail-thin girlfriend never tantalized anyone with the luscious curves that catapulted Gisele to stardom in her late teens, replacing the pale, wasted “heroin chic” of that era with “the return of the sexy model.” Since then, the tanned, athletic Brazilian beach babe who seemed born to wear a bikini has become the world’s most successful supermodel, amassing a fortune estimated at $150 million; last year alone, according to Forbes, Gisele earned $35 million. The 16th-richest woman in the entertainment industry, she has been featured on more magazine covers than any other model and has appeared as the face of more than 20 brands internationally, with current contracts including Dior, Versace, Max Factor, Ebel watches, and the Dolce & Gabbana fragrance The One.\\nAt 28, Gisele has already spent 14 years in front of the cameras, not to mention in the gossip columns—and now she’s begun a whole new chapter of her life. On February 26, seven days after our cover was shot, she married New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady in a private twilight ceremony at a Catholic church in Santa Monica that was followed by a small gathering at the couple’s home in Brentwood.\\nAlthough the union had the iconic inevitability of typecasting, all-American-style—“the jock marries the prom queen,” as one Web site put it—the news surprised even their friends. Earlier the same week, Gisele had been partying at Carnival in Rio de Janeiro, where she made an appearance for Pantene hair-care products that was widely photographed—and then she suddenly turned up married in Los Angeles. But Gisele, who once described her ideal wedding as “a simple ceremony,” always knew she didn’t want an enormous extravaganza. “I don’t like parties. I prefer something more intimate, just for the closest people.”\\nWhich was precisely what she got. Crestfallen, the paparazzi press had to settle for an after-the-fact description of Gisele’s attire: “The bride, 28, donned a form-fitting ivory lace strapless gown with a trumpet skirt, scalloped edges, long train and a floor-length veil with attached handmade satin roses and attached satin headband, all by Dolce & Gabbana. Her three dogs also wore matching Dolce & Gabbana floral lace collars,” Us Weekly reported.\\nTo Gisele, getting married was merely a formality. “I already feel that way,” she told me a few days before the wedding. “We’ve been together over two years; we’ve been living together. My idea of that is you have a partner who’s got your back. When I’m weak, you can be strong; when I’m strong, you can be weak. That’s what I believe marriage is. Loving someone, you want to grow with them, share with them, share the same values, the same feelings about things, the same beliefs.”\\nAnd Gisele—who was raised in a large Catholic family by parents who have been married for 37 years—is convinced she has found her soulmate in Brady. “He’s very close to his family,” she said. “He’s Catholic. His parents have been married 40 years. He’s got a pure heart. That’s all that matters—he’s got the purest heart. I feel grateful because I have a lot of love in my life. I found the person I’m sharing my life with. I have a good man.”\\nIn the months leading up to the wedding, the tabloids buzzed excitedly with rumors of impending nuptials, claiming that Brady had proposed on a private jet on Christmas Eve or that he had gotten down on one knee with a diamond solitaire in mid-January—neither of which was true, according to Gisele, who says they were secretly engaged for considerably longer but she avoided wearing her ring in public because she didn’t want to draw any more attention to herself. The fact that their stealth wedding remained dignified and discreet, and that the news didn’t leak until after it was over, represented a noteworthy victory over the celebrity media that have remained obsessed with Gisele’s every move since she became Leonardo DiCaprio’s girlfriend nine years ago.\\nHeightened by the raging “Leo-mania” that followed Titanic’s popularity as the highest-grossing film of all time, the irresistible pairing of gorgeous supermodel and heartthrob superstar kept the gossip columns in overdrive throughout their five-year relationship, which was fraught with dramas that included an eight-month breakup, a reconciliation, and recurring reports of Gisele’s exasperation at Leo’s womanizing ways.\\nEven the end of their romance, in 2005, failed to stem the flow of slavering updates: Leo still can’t believe Gisele dumped him because he refused to make a commitment! Leo drunk-dials Gisele just to hear her voice! Leo wants his current girlfriend, Israeli model Bar Refaeli, on the cover of the Sports Illustrated swimsuit issue—just to irritate Gisele!\\nBut Gisele herself had moved on. At the end of 2006, she fell in love with Tom Brady—an event she describes as practically instantaneous. “I knew right way—the first time I saw him,” she says. “We met through a friend. The moment I saw him, he smiled and I was like, That is the most beautiful, charismatic smile I’ve ever seen! We sat and talked for three hours. I had to go home for Christmas, but I didn’t want to leave. You know that feeling of, like, you can’t get enough? From the first day we met, we’ve never spent one day without speaking to each other.”\\nUntil then, Gisele was happy to be on her own. “I’d been single for a year, and I wasn’t looking for a relationship,” she says. “I’d always been in serious relationships, but you learn a lot about yourself when you’re by yourself, and I was enjoying that process. But you don’t choose.”\\nNot when it comes to a coup de foudre, anyway. Does she believe in love at first sight? “I believe in feeling connected. Love is something that grows, that comes from nourishment; it builds. But there is a great feeling that happens, that is telling you, I don’t want to leave this room! Whatever that’s called, that’s what happened.”\\nTheir initial bliss was soon dispelled by an unwelcome development. Brady had recently broken up with his girlfriend of the previous three years, Bridget Moynahan, a model and an actress. Soon after he got involved with Gisele, Moynahan announced that she was pregnant with Brady’s child and would have the baby on her own.\\n“It was definitely a surprise for both of us,” Gisele acknowledges with a rueful smile. “In the beginning you’re living this romantic fantasy; you’re thinking, This can’t be true, it’s so good! And then, Whoops—wake-up call!” She rolls her eyes. “We were dating two and a half months when he found out, and it was a very challenging situation. Obviously, in the beginning, it’s not the ideal thing.”\\nMoynahan’s pregnancy made Gisele wonder whether she should encourage Brady to re-unite with his former girlfriend. “You question at times—‘Should I stay here? Maybe you should work this out,’” she admits. “But when people break up, it’s for a reason.”\\nIn retrospect, she believes that dealing with the challenge only strengthened her commitment to Brady. “I think it was a blessing, because otherwise I don’t think I would have known what he was made of, and he wouldn’t have known what I was made of,” she says. “I wouldn’t have seen the integrity in him—the way he was a good person through all the times. I was like, You have the heart in a good place! It made me feel more in love with him; it made me realize who he was. Our relationship has become so much stronger, and I think I wouldn’t be as certain as I am today if it weren’t for that.”\\nAfter John Edward Thomas Moynahan was born, in August 2007, Brady and Gisele began shuttling between Boston, where Brady’s football team is based, and Los Angeles, where Moynahan lives. “When we are in L.A. we have Johnny 50 percent of the time,” Gisele says. “He’s a little angel—the sweetest, most cuddly, loving baby. I feel blessed to have him in my life.”\\nLast year she and Brady purchased an $11.7 million plot of land in a gated community in Brentwood. Despite their commitment to spending time with John, however, Gisele has never met his mother. “I understand that he has a mom, and I respect that, but to me it’s not like because somebody else delivered him, that’s not my child. I feel it is, 100 percent,” Gisele says. “I want him to have a great relationship with his mom, because that’s important, but I love him the same way as if he were mine. I already feel like he’s my son, from the first day.”\\nOne of six sisters, Gisele is also eager to have her own children. “I would like a big family,” she says. “I love children. When you come from a big family, you see that growing up you’re learning how to share. Your sisters have got your back; you’re not alone in this—‘We all support you!’ Your family provides that; it gives you a sense of safety, and it’s a very grounding feeling. That’s why I feel I can fly away, because I have those roots and they’re so deep. This is what I want to have in my life. This is why you get married—you want to create those roots together; you want to give that to your kids. I would also love to adopt a child from Brazil. When you come from São Paulo, you see five-year-olds sniffing glue on the corner. You think, If you make a difference in the life of one of them, that makes your time on this earth worthwhile. I will have a colorful family, like a rainbow. I have dogs from rescue; they are all my dogs. Children are like little angels—there’s no way you can’t love them.”\\nRecounting all this, Gisele has been talking in her usual mile-a-minute torrent of words, which is virtually unstoppable and exuberantly high-spirited. Whether she is telling the story of her life for hours on end or working from eight a.m. until dark at a photo shoot, her energy doesn’t flag. “I never get physically tired,” she tells me the next day in the ninth hour of a shoot that has her posing outdoors in 40-degree weather wearing only a Dior corset. (“If it’s not torture, it’s not fashion,” she mutters with a mischievous grin.) After every interruption, her running commentary instantly starts up again as if someone has simply flipped the “on” switch.\\nSome interviewers have made sport of Gisele’s accent, which “can best be described as Continental,” one wrote. “She seems to have learned English from Italian designers, German hairstylists, and French makeup artists. Her enunciation is equal parts Donatella, Hans and Franz, and Maurice Chevalier.” That reporter didn’t mention how many languages he himself has mastered, but Gisele speaks fluent English, Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish in addition to some German and some French—no small achievement for a girl from the backcountry of Brazil who left school at 14.\\nNo matter which language she’s burbling along in, she is warm, friendly, humorous, and gaily self-deprecating. Right now we’re sitting at the dining table on the ground floor of her town house, where she is nibbling delicately at lamb chops and vegetables ordered from a nearby restaurant. Quivering with anticipation, her Yorkshire terrier sits slavishly at her feet.\\n“Vida, Vida, Vida,” Gisele croons. “‘Vida’ means life; she’s the golden girl—that’s why I call her Golden. She loves the bone. She deserves a little bone!” Cooing, Gisele hands a lamb chop to Vida, who snatches it and runs. “Vida, let’s make a deal: I’ll give you a bone every day—you live forever!”\\nGisele has already paid her own respects to the lamb chops by putting her hand over them and saying a silent prayer. “I eat a lot of meat, and I bless my food before it enters my body, because I need to be aware of what I’m eating,” she explains. “You bless it first and say, ‘Thank you for giving your life.’ This animal has given its life for me. You’ve got to be grateful; you’ve got to be conscious. You can’t just take it for granted. How many people in the world have no food? I think it’s important to acknowledge that.”\\nAn avid reader, Gisele has been deeply influenced by Buddhism. (Her current view of the church she grew up in: “O.K., Catholic religion, we’ve got to update!”) These days she tries hard to practice the concept of mindfulness, which—when combined with her characteristically sunny, upbeat outlook—seems to produce an ebullience so consistent that somebody should bottle it and sell it. Her positive mental attitude proved a considerable asset after Brady learned that his ex-girlfriend was having his child.\\n“We are saying, ‘What can we learn from this? How can we make the best out of this?’” Gisele says. “We both grew a lot. There is good in everything; it’s just how you choose to look at it. Everything that’s worth it has a price. For me to be a model—I had to leave my family. Do you think I liked that? No! There are sacrifices. Life is meant to be a challenge, because challenges are what make you grow. How boring it would be if we knew what was going to happen tomorrow!” She beams. “Life always surprises me—in a very good way.”\\n“She is the most positive and energetic person I have ever met,” says Brady. “She always looks at challenges as her greatest opportunities.”\\nFor Gisele, the surprises began when she was “discovered” by a modeling scout at the age of 14. She grew up in Horizontina, a small town in southern Brazil where “there were no buses, no subway—there’s not even a traffic light in my village,” she says. The local population is dominated by Brazilians of German descent, and Gisele’s ancestry is German on both sides of her family. She and her fraternal twin, Patricia, were the middle daughters among six girls, all of whom are good-looking. In the youthful photograph that occupies a place of honor on the big desk that dominates Gisele’s living room, her father is handsome and her mother is strikingly beautiful.\\nThe family’s circumstances were modest. “I grew up in a house with two bedrooms and two bathrooms, for eight people,” Gisele says. “We weren’t considered poor; we were considered middle-class. My mother was a cashier in a bank for 35 years. My father had many jobs: he was in construction, then he did something with packaging milk, then he worked for Amway; he gave courses about self-awareness. He was away a lot. My mother was, like, the one who was more concerned about how to bring home the bacon; she worked and devoted herself to us. She is my hero. She did everything. She was a really great mother; she was always teaching us, helping us, talking to us. My father was more the philosophical person; my mother was the realist.”\\nGisele’s childhood world revolved around her sisters, but she stood out even then. “I was extremely hyper when I was a kid, like bouncing off the walls,” she says. “I think that if I was in America they’d probably give me medication.”\\nHer twin describes her as bold and fearless. “Unlike me, Gisele was very talkative, and she wasn’t afraid to be away from home for some time even when she was little,” says Patricia. “She was very brave, and she was always trying to protect her sisters—something like ‘Don’t mess with my sisters or you’ll have to deal with me!’”\\nThe girls participated in every activity available in their small town. “We did ballet, gymnastics—I think my mom was trying to keep us busy,” Gisele says. “She had to work, so we went to a modeling course—me and my twin and one of our sisters, Gabby, who’s like the second twin because we’re one year apart. We were the Three Musketeers, and we did everything together.”\\nThe modeling course culminated in an excursion to a São Paulo amusement park. “We had to drive 29 hours to go there,” Gisele says. “I couldn’t be more excited! I was eating at a food court in the shopping mall, and this guy from Elite came and said, ‘You should be a model.’ It was the first time in my life that someone thought I looked pretty.”\\nUntil then, Gisele regarded her appearance as an affliction rather than an asset. “I was tall and really thin; the kids in school called me Olive Oyl and Saracura, which is a bird with really skinny long legs,” she reports. “I was taller than every guy in my class. Especially at that age, you think you’re the weirdest thing that ever walked on earth.”\\nDespite knife-blade cheekbones, wide-set navy-blue eyes, a dazzling smile, and that mane of honey-colored hair, Gisele didn’t consider herself to be beautiful, and she thought her nose was too big. Every one of her sisters was many inches shorter, and all of Gisele’s clothes were hand-me-downs. “I had to wear my sister’s jeans; they were, like, to here on me,” she says, pointing to her knee. “I wasn’t so popular; my twin sister was definitely more popular than I was. She has a great personality—everyone liked her. But I was an A student, and the way I got friends was I used to give help to somebody else. And I’ve always been very athletic; I was captain of the volleyball team. I was such a tomboy. The ‘in’ people weren’t so much into me, but I didn’t care. My sisters were my best friends, always. It was a great life, and obviously it made me know who I am. If I were told I could come back as anything, I would have chosen the same life, the same family, the same experiences, the same friends.”\\nBut her time in that safe, protected world was about to end, and when Gisele returned alone to São Paulo for a modeling contest, her introduction to big-city life was a shock. “The first time I traveled by myself, it was to a city of 22 million people. My father gave me $50, and I was supposed to get a cab to go to the models’ apartment—but I said, I’ll take the subway,” she recalls. “I was thinking about saving some of the money to buy some clothes, because everything I was wearing was my sister’s. I thought I was being very smart. So I get to the station, I went to open my backpack, and my wallet was gone. I had no idea somebody would rob me! In my city, nobody ever robbed anybody; it was all a big happy family. So I was crying. How am I going to get from here to where I am going? I’m asking people for money so I can go in a pay phone and call my father. He’s like, ‘Why didn’t you take the cab? You should listen to your father!’ I walked like 30 minutes and finally got there.” She sighs. “There was a lot of those times, but I learned pretty fast. I never was fearful. I think my parents did a good job; we were very independent kids, because my parents were always working. I was in the worst places and never felt afraid. I always felt like everything was going to be O.K.—and it was.”\\nLearning how to model was another challenge. “In the beginning I had no idea what I was doing,” Gisele admits. “I had no idea what modeling was. I didn’t know it’s about becoming something—embodying something. It’s not you. I didn’t understand that. I was like this!” She bares her teeth in a horrible rigor-mortis grin. “I wasn’t aware of my body. All my life I felt awkward about myself.” But the idea that somebody had found her attractive was intoxicating. “Out of those 50 girls, that guy thought I was pretty,” she recalls, a dreamy look softening her face. “People weren’t calling me Olive Oyl. It was a different standard of beauty.”\\nAnd yet, even as a novice, Gisele had a sturdy sense of her own self-worth that helped her keep the rigors of modeling in perspective. “Some people were like, ‘She’s never going to make it!’ But not everybody has to like me,” she says. “Some people like watermelon; some people like pineapple. It doesn’t mean that watermelon is better. People have different tastes.” She shrugs.\\n“Her willpower made her successful,” says Patricia. “She has never let the critics put her down, and this has never changed. She has the most amazing body, but what has really made her successful is her personality, her way of doing things, her professionalism.”\\nAs an athlete, Brady says he admires Gisele for “being a ferocious businesswoman who is ultra-competitive and intent on being the best at what she does.”\\nAs the demand for Gisele’s services grew, she felt compelled to accept every job that was offered. “I was just going 100 miles an hour,” she says. “You don’t want to say no, because you don’t know how long it’s going to last, and you have to prove yourself.”\\nBut the frenetic pace finally caught up with her. “When I was working every day I was completely detached from my emotions, and I didn’t know the toll it was taking on me,” she says. “I was traveling everywhere, not having stability. I was very abusive of myself. I wouldn’t sleep; I was eating junk food every day and working 10 to 12 hours. No wonder! How much can your body take? I felt overwhelmed by the whole thing. I went through a time when I was very sensitive and felt very fragile. I would cry, but you don’t know where it’s coming from. When I was 22 I hit a point where I thought, I miss my mom. I want to go home! I want to take six months off. I want my support system; I want that grounding thing my family gives me. I wanted to bond with them. I felt like, ‘I’m part of this family—take me back, please!’”\\nThe sabbatical was just what she needed: “It was great. I took my parents to Africa. I felt nourished and loved again, so I could come back and start all over again. But I was humbled by the whole thing.”\\nWhen Gisele returned to work, she stopped smoking and started taking better care of herself. Exercise was never a problem; ever since childhood, she has displayed an alarming appetite for extreme sports. “If somebody had something broken, it was me,” she admits. “I did skydiving, bungee-jumping, kayaking, surfing, jumping horses—my horse was 18 hands and it stepped on my foot and I couldn’t walk. Everything I’ve ever been afraid of, I’ve tried to overcome. I was always on planes, and I always used to be apprehensive, so I thought, I’ve got to find a way to not be afraid. So I started jumping out of planes.”\\nHer determination is particularly apparent in kung fu, a discipline she has taken up with a vengeance since moving to Boston. “She wants it every day; we actually trained Thanksgiving Day and New Year’s Day. There’s no day off,” says Yao Li, her teacher at the Boston Kung Fu Tai Chi Institute. “I think part of her has a macho spirit. Tom teases her: he’s a fan of Bruce Lee movies, and he calls her Gise-Lee.”\\nAthletic and down to earth, Gisele—who wears as little makeup as possible and spends her off-hours in jeans and T-shirts—is very different in daily life from the glamorous persona she creates for the camera. “When I go to work, I do pretend,” she explains. “I call it ‘Her.’ Like, ‘I think She needs to be a little bit more like this.’” She tilts her head, sucks in her cheeks, and pantomimes an exaggerated attitude. “It’s almost like some on-and-off button. I don’t see myself as Her. My perception of myself is very different from the perception people have of me.”\\nDespite all her years at the top, co-workers say, she retains a healthy understanding of the difference between real life and the hype of the job. “When this all ends, she’ll be fine,” says a makeup artist who has worked with Gisele since she was a teenager.\\nGisele-watchers who pore over red-carpet photographs often assume she has a fabulous lifestyle crammed with parties and A-list events. “Are you kidding? I like to be in bed by 10:30,” she exclaims. “I’m up at 6:30, doing yoga at 7 a.m. I went to a gallery for my friend’s exhibition last night, because he was my friend and asked me to come. It was a scene, and I was just like, No! No! I have to go! On the way home I walked into this place where they have the best burger in the world, and I was just thinking to myself, Oh my god, I am so lucky to have my life! I’m having a great time here! I just came back from this place where it’s about appearance and who’s wearing this and who’s talking to that, where I felt suffocated, and I’m so happy that’s not my life!”\\nNot that she hasn’t enjoyed her success and its rewards—she is as excited as a little girl as she shows me photographs of the remodeling job she gave her parents to spruce up their home. The business of being Gisele has also enabled her to employ four of her five sisters. For her work in Brazil, Patricia is her manager, Gabriela is her lawyer, and Raquel does accounting. Rafaela works on Gisele’s Web site. The other sister, Graziela, is a judge.\\nBut Gisele takes even more satisfaction in having earned such success without compromising herself. “I’m really happy with the way I’ve lived my life,” she says. “I’m an honorable person. I’m proud of the way I’ve done things. I’ve never in my life acted in any way that wasn’t of the highest integrity that I was raised with. I’m the same person—with different life experience, but the things that make me happy are the same things. Having barbecue with my family, hanging out with my friends, being with animals, riding bikes—that’s what made me happy all my life. I feel really good about that. I want to finish this life and say, ‘I did the best I could. I lived my values. I kept my integrity.’”\\nGisele’s values have also been shaped by her reading, which ranges from the teachings of Buddhist master Thich Nhat Hanh to her current favorites, Don Miguel Ruiz’s books of Toltec wisdom, The Four Agreements, The Mastery of Love, and The Voice of Knowledge. Such works have helped to give her a newfound sense of inner peace. “Everything became so much simpler,” she says. “It’s like, ‘Oh—now I get it!’ You have this kind of epiphany—I don’t need to sweat the small stuff! Enjoy the journey, not the destination. I want to be happy every day. I want to live life to the fullest, feeling joyful. If I don’t, I’ve got to stop and question why, because I think our natural state should be that. Reading things is so important to me—things that can open up your mind. You need to feed your mind.”\\nShe has even achieved a beatific attitude toward DiCaprio, about whom she has nothing bad to say. “Leo is a really wonderful person,” she says. “We still speak sometimes, and I’m friends with his mom. He still has one of my dogs. He’s done a lot for the environment, and I admire what he’s done. We know what we had; we were very young, and we grew together in a lot of ways. We were just not meant to be boyfriend and girlfriend, but I respect him enormously, and I wish him nothing but the best.”\\nEnvironmental causes remain among Gisele’s top priorities. According to her manager, Anne Nelson at IMG, she donates a portion of the profits from her Brazilian line of flip-flops, Ipanema Gisele Bündchen, to protect Amazon rain-forest water sources through Y Ikatu Xingu (Save the Good Waters of the Xingu River), as well as supporting several other Brazilian programs to protect waterways and restore deforested areas. The Bündchen family has started Projeto Agua Limpa (Project Clean Water) to reforest the land and improve water quality along riverbanks in the region where Gisele was born.\\nShe has also created the Luz Foundation, a project to empower girls and help them deal with self-esteem issues. Last summer Gisele and her yoga teacher, Amy Lombardo, did some volunteer work with Portuguese-speaking teenagers in the Boston suburbs. “She’s always trying to find ways to use her celebrity to good cause, and we talked to them about media images and the effects on young girls,” Lombardo explains. “Gisele is a natural yogi; she’s constantly trying to find new ways to learn, and she has a genuine desire to better herself as a person. Yoga provides her with a way to be who she is, not the image in the media. I think she’s going to be a role model for young women. She’s very passionate about the idea of helping people have access to raising their own level of awareness. We’ve only begun to see what she’s capable of.”\\nGisele “has her heart set on making the world a better place,” says Brady.\\nAs her ambitions evolve, Gisele is scaling back her modeling work. “I have a lot of things to juggle. I have a family that comes first; my job already comes second,” she says. “But everything I’ll do in the future has to be something that’s related to higher consciousness. I don’t think I’ll be happy unless I do this. It’s all about using what you’ve got, and what I’ve got is a voice.”\\nAnd she wants to use that voice to counterbalance the inadvertent messages that are inevitably communicated by her extraordinary face and figure. “This is just a shell”—Gisele gestures dismissively at her formidable body—“and the shell is going to be changing. You’re going to be 30; you’re going to be 50. That’s why I think it’s important to focus on what matters. Everyone has talents—you’ve just got to find them—and everyone has flaws. Wishing to be something you’re not is the biggest recipe for a sad life. All of us are special. Embrace all that you are! Treat yourself as the special being you are!”\\nAnd if you do, she believes, you can accomplish anything. After all, it worked for her. She flashes a radiant smile. “All you have to have is a dream, and then you make it happen,” she says.',\n",

But you can take simple steps to protect yourself.\\nIf your blood pressure or cholesterol level is higher than it should be, this increases your risk of heart disease. Your GP can suggest lifestyle changes or, if necessary, prescribe medication to reduce your blood pressure or cholesterol.\\nRead more about the NHS health check for over-40s.\\n2. Stop smoking\\nYou’re twice as likely to have a heart attack if you smoke. Over the past few decades, men have increasingly quit smoking but women haven’t been stopping smoking as much. In fact, more young women now smoke than young men. Stopping smoking will lessen your chances of developing heart disease.\\nFind out how the NHS can help you stop smoking.\\n3. Get moving\\nOnly about one woman in four in England does enough physical activity to protect her heart. Try to do more exercise, including regular aerobic exercise such as walking and swimming. To protect your heart, you need to do at least 150 minutes (2 hours and 30 minutes) of moderate-intensity aerobic activity (such as cycling or fast walking) every week.\\nRead more about how to get fit.\\n4. Lose weight if you need to\\nAbout six in every ten women in England are either overweight or obese. Carrying excess weight puts a strain on your heart, and you’re more likely to have high blood pressure and high cholesterol, which also increase the risk of heart disease.\\nRead more about how to lose weight.\\n5. Change shape\\nYour shape matters as well as your weight. Like many women in the 40-60 age group, you may be apple shaped, where excess weight settles around your waist. Being apple shaped puts you at higher risk of heart disease than being pear shaped, where excess weight is concentrated on the hips. Aim for a waistline of less than 80cm (31.5 inches).\\nRead more about why your body shape matters.\\n6. Drink wisely\\nDrinking a little alcohol regularly may be good for your heart, but make sure you stay within the recommended limits. Drinking more will increase your risk of heart problems. Heart healthy drinking for women is one or two units of alcohol a day. If you drink more than this, you’ll increase your risk of heart disease. Too much alcohol, or binge-drinking, can damage the heart muscle leading to abnormal heart rhythms or heart failure.\\nRead more about alcohol units and how to cut down your drinking.\\n7. Balance your diet\\nEat healthily and be especially careful not to eat more salt than is recommended (no more than 6g a day) and to cut down on the amount of saturated fat you eat.\\n8. Don’t rely on hormones\\nDoctors used to think that using hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for menopausal symptoms also protected women against heart disease. Research now suggests that HRT isn’t heart protective and, as with all drug treatments, there are side effects. Take HRT if you need it to relieve menopausal hot flushes and night sweats, but don’t expect it to help your heart.\\nRead more about HRT.\\n9. Manage your stress\\nSome studies have suggested that stress can contribute to heart disease. If you feel under a lot of stress, it's important to learn how to relax. There are some simple techniques you can learn to help you cope with stress. If you feel so stressed and anxious that it's affecting your daily life, your GP can help you deal with it.\\nRead more about how to manage stress.\\n© Copyright 2001-2010 Newsquest Media Group\",\n",

       " {'text': 'Eric’s guest posts at the beginning of this week came at a great time. I have just been too busy to write much for the blog lately. It is not that I have a shortage of content- in fact, look for a book review next week and a couple of product reviews soon. It is just that, as I mentioned before, free time has been hard to come by lately. I have received quite a few emails from readers the past couple of weeks though, so today I want to quickly pass along a few of the links that some of you have been sent to me.\\nBrad is a friend and former co-worker who now lives in Taipei. He works near the new trade show hall, so he stopped by to check out the show last week and sent me these pictures of a women specific Giant Avail Diamond road bike. Yeah, this particular bike is a little outrageous with its jeweled accents, but Brad mentioned that bikes designed for women are becoming very popular in Taiwan. He points out that “there is even a 2 floor Giant shop downtown entirely devoted to women’s bikes and accessories know as LIV.” Check out the link to the LIV site; pretty interesting.\\nBrad also sent me a link to the website for Speed One, a Taiwanese company that makes some interesting bikes, mostly of the small wheeled variety.\\nRobb from MTB by 198 recently visited the production facilities at Cane Creek Cycling Components. He has a great post from the visit with several pictures of the production and testing areas.\\nLawrence pointed out a completely wooden bike made by a carpenter named Peijia Wu from the village of Nanzhuang in Shandong province, China.\\nIn response to my post about the Skua, pjotr320 commented that the ‘Velayo’ velomobile from Germany features rear wheel steering. A quick Google search turned up this and this. Let me know if any of you, especially those of you who can read German, know any more about this design.\\nOn a related note, Krash sent me a link to VeloKit, which is “an easily removed, all weather body for three wheeled recumbent bikes.” He points out that it is a “reasonably priced alternative to dedicated hard-shelled velomobiles and gas guzzling autos.”\\nRounding out the velomobile topic, I will point out a new blog on that subject sent to me by Pixelman. It is written in French, but even if you can’t read it, check it out for pictures of various designs.\\nIt has been a couple of weeks, but Lane sent a link to his website, CETMA Cargo. He hand builds racks and cargo bikes in Oregon. It is a nice looking, straightforward cargo bike design, so I encourage you to take a look at some of the pictures on his site.\\nContrail is a conceptual frame mounted device, which leaves a chalk line behind your bike as you ride creating impromptu bike lanes throughout the city (or at least showing others where someone else has ridden). The design has been around the web lately, but I think it is an interesting concept that is worth another mention.\\nFinally, I will close with a link to something that is not even really a bike. It does look like it would be fun to try out though. I don’t know much about this “spin vehicle”, but you have to like the look of fear on the face of the rendered model toward the bottom of the page.',\n",

       " {'text': \"Inhaled prostacyclin offers cost-effective way to save lives\\nSkyrocketing costs for nitric oxide, the standard of care for patients requiring inhaled pulmonary vasodilator therapy, generated interest in finding a new way to safely and effectively treat pulmonary hypertension. In February 2010, Dr. Newton Seiden, pediatric anesthesiologist and intensivist, Children's Hospital Central California, attended a presentation at the University of Virginia that introduced the use of inhaled prostacyclin as an alternative pathway for pulmonary vasodilation.\\nChildren's Hospital spends $2,700 per day for each patient receiving treatment with nitric oxide. Prostacyclin, marketed under the brand name Flolan, costs less than $200 a day per patient. Dr. Seiden returned to the Hospital’s pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) eager to investigate the possibility of using nebulized Flolan to widen blood vessels in the vascular system in a safe and controlled modality.\\n“We started using it in PICU first,” said Larry Nicol, registered respiratory therapist and clinical educator at Children’s. “We had a complete buy-in with the intensivists, cardiac surgeons and cardiologists. All the PICU doctors were excited about giving it a try.”\\nSuccessful trial run\\nBy April 2010 the experiment proved successful. Of the 25 patients receiving Flolan in increasing doses while being progressively weaned from nitric oxide, 19 were completely transitioned from gas to Flolan with no adverse events.\\nInitially the neonatology group was reluctant to deviate from the current standard of care for their babies in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). But when a critically ill infant was not responding to treatment with nitric oxide, the positive results in PICU convinced them to give Flolan a try. “We added the second pathway of inhaled prostacylin while keeping the patient on the maximum dose of nitric oxide,” said Nicol. “We were able to make a change in the patient we hadn’t seen on nitric oxide alone and that’s very exciting.”\\nIn a second NICU case, a neonate was weaned from nitric oxide within four hours after starting Flolan and continued with the nebulized drug for 13 days. “We’re sharing our protocols and outcomes with approximately 40 other US hospitals,” said Nicol. “We’ve received requests for information from all over the world.” Nitric oxide remains the first line (rescue) drug at Children’s Hospital for pulmonary hypertension. However, after the gas is running, Flolan can be added at any time as determined by the attending physician. If a patient is completely weaned from nitric oxide, the gas is kept inline for backup.\\nHigher standard of care\\n“This alternate pathway for pulmonary vessel dilation has helped Children's raise the standard of care and reduce costs at the same time,” said Nicol. For example, the NICU patient’s 13 days of inhaled pulmonary vasodilator therapy at $200 per day for Flolan rather than $2,700 per day for nitric oxide resulted in $32,500 savings. Since introducing the use of inhaled prostacyclin two years ago at Children’s Hospital, 37 patients have received Flolan with no adverse events, and our total savings have surpassed $335,000.\",\n",

       " {'text': 'I remember reading a regular section in my grandmothers Reader\\'s Digest Magazine called \"Kids Say the Darndest Things.\" Even as a kid myself I enjoyed reading that part of the magazine. Now that I am a grandmother I often reflect back on those articles when my own grandkids say something that I think is especially funny.\\nWith my granddaughter being 2-1/2 years old, we are always saying things to her, like \"I am so proud of you\" when she does something wonderful like use the potty chair or when she feeds herself without making a complete mess of herself and the two people seated on either side of her. I often wondered if Sydney really understood what \"I\\'m proud of you\" really meant. Then one day she said one those \"darndest things\" and I knew for sure that she really does understand what it means.\\nNanny the Skillful Driver\\nAs you know my grandkids come to work with my daughter in my baby store. One day I needed to run some errands around town so my granddaughter Sydney and I headed out to my van in the alley parking area behind my store. I normally am among the first to arrive in the morning and the last to leave at night so I rarely experience any issues with parking. But on this day, I discovered that the other cars had filled the parking area and were now parked very close to the driver side of my van. On the passenger side sat a huge trash bin that had just been emptied and now sat at an angle precariously close to my van.\\nSydney and I had to enter on the passenger side of the van then figure out how to get out of this tight space without hitting another car, the trash bin, or the building right behind us. I was talking to myself as I pulled up and back in little increments to get my vehicle maneuvered out of this spot. [Side note: I always think out load around babies, I think it makes them feel that I am talking directly to them :) ] So Sydney is listening to me and watching my movements out the window from her seat directly behind me.\\nIt takes me several minutes to get my van out of the parking spot but I finally accomplish it. From the back seat I hear Sydney clapping her hands and she says, \"Oh Nanny, I So Proud of you!\" I nearly cried at that moment because I realized that not only did she truly understand what we mean when we tell her that we are proud of her accomplishments, she even knew how to use it herself. She really was proud of me. :-)\\nPS: Share the cute, funny, shocking, adorable, insightful and intelligent things that your kids & grandkids say...I would love to hear about them!',\n",

The new IRS ruling gives employers the authority to act when employees do not.\\nThe ruling, made in what the IRS calls a \"general information letter,\" allows companies to automatically enroll employees in a 401(k) plan and even increase their contribution levels on time increments or when employees receive raises or bonuses, the Sun-Sentinel reported.\\nWhile some may see Big Brother at work when a company automatically enrolls its employees, the IRS made it clear that employees can opt out at any time.\\nKaren Ferguson, who as director of the Pension Rights Center in Washington is an advocate for workers, told the Sun-Sentinel that companies are not infringing on employee rights when they enroll them into 401(k) plans without their consent.\\n\"If employees don\\'t have something like this, too many of them are going to end up living on nothing but Social Security when they retire, and that won\\'t even keep them at the poverty level,\" Ferguson said. \"In the old days, companies contributed for you. This is the closest approximation available to today\\'s workers.\"\\nTraditionally, companies tell employees about the savings plan and wait for them to take action. In this new scenario, automatic enrollment occurs unless the employees specifically say they don’t want it.',\n",

Related contributions include donations, legacies, and other gifts received as a result of fund raising efforts.\\n|Please note that standards 8 and 9 have different denominators.|\\n|Formula for Standard 9:|\\n|Total Fund Raising Expenses\\n||should be no more than 35%|\\n|Total Related Contributions|\\nAn organization that does not meet Standards 8, 9 and/or 10 may provide evidence to demonstrate that its use of funds is reasonable. The higher fund raising and administrative costs of a newly created organization, donor restrictions on the use of funds, exceptional bequests, a stigma associated with a cause, and environmental or political events beyond an organization\\'s control are among factors which may result in expenditures that are reasonable although they do not meet the financial measures cited in these standards.\\nInformation Needed from Charity to Determine Compliance:\\nThe charity provides the latest financial statements required for its income level, as specified in Standard 11. Depending on the size of the charity\\'s income, this financial statement may be in the form of audited or reviewed financial statements, internally produced financial statements or IRS Form 990.\\nIn calculating this financial ratio, the Alliance will also consider any issues about the accuracy of the charity\\'s financial statements as described in Standard 13.\\nThe Alliance proceeds as follows in determining the fund-raising expense ratio:\\nDefinitions Used for Standard 9\\n- Related contributions refers to those types of support generated through fund raising activities. It is not intended to refer only to annual gifts and can include donations, special event income, bequests, fund raising event revenue, federated campaigns, donated goods, donated services, and grants including foundation and government grants, etc. Other types of revenue (for example, membership dues) may be included under certain conditions.\\n- As defined in the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Not-for-Profit Organizations Audit and Accounting Guide, paragraph 5.27, \"Some not-for-profit organizations receive dues from their members. These transfers often have elements of both a contribution and an exchange transaction because members receive tangible or intangible benefits from their membership in the organization.\" As a result, depending on the circumstances, a portion of membership dues (or the total, if there are no membership benefits) may be considered to be a related contribution.\\n- Some organizations may receive contributions that donor(s) have provided with the specification that these gifts be transferred to another charity. For example, a donor to a federated campaign specifies that the contribution be given to ABC charity. In such circumstances, the accounting rules require that such donations not be recognized as part of the federated organization\\'s total revenue. For purposes of this standard, however, if fund raising expenses are incurred by the federated organization to generate such gifts, those gifts are considered to be related contributions.\\n- Fund raising expenses include invitations to voting membership and appeals to voting members, when a contribution is a principal requirement for membership\\n- Fund raising\\n- Using the charity\\'s audited or reviewed financial statements\\n- If the charity does not have audited or reviewed financial statements, the Alliance uses the IRS Form 990 to calculate the ratio. Using the IRS Form 990, the Alliance identifies the total related contributions figure, usually by adding the following three applicable line items: line 1d (total contributions) plus line 3 (membership dues) plus line 9c (revenue from special fund raising events). The Alliance then divides line 15 (total fund raising expense) by the total related contributions figure to determine the ratio of fund raising expense to related contributions (See also application of Standard 13).\\n- If the charity does not have an audited or reviewed financial statement, or IRS Form 990, the Alliance uses the latest available unaudited financial statement to calculate the ratio of fund raising expense to related contributions as explained in (a) above.\\n- If the charity does not have audited, reviewed or unaudited financial statements but completes IRS Form 990-EZIRS 990-EZ does not identify the charity\\'s total fund raising expenses.\\nA charity that does not meet this 35% standard and believes there is an extenuating circumstance should inform the Alliance of its position.\\nIn applying this standard, the Alliance prefers to use the audited financial statements rather than the IRS Form 990 for reasons including the following:\\n- In some cases, the audit report combines the finances of the subject charity with the finances of entities closely affiliated with it through financial and governance relationships, as required by generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). However, the IRS may require these different entities to file separate IRS Form 990s instead of a combined form.\\n- The audit report may include the value of donated services and the use of facilities as both a contribution and corresponding expense item, while the IRS Form 990 does not include these amounts.\\n- The audit report may include certain note disclosures relevant to the application of this standard that would not appear in the IRS Form 990.',\n",

Scientists at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) and the Veterans Administration (VA) did discover a chemical compound that caused hair regrowth in mice with alopecia, but they were testing the compound on the mouse digestive system.\\nSpecifically, the researchers were studying how stress affects digestion, as it does in irritable bowel syndrome, for example. Working with genetically engineered mice which overproduced a stress hormone called corticotrophin-releasing factor or CRF. As the mice age, it so happens, CRF also causes loss of fur, much the same way that stress can cause baldness in humans.\\nThe focus of the study was to test the effectiveness of an \\'antagonist\\' compound called astressin-B, which blocks the effects of CRF, to see if it would reverse the effects of irritable bowel syndrome in the mice. After five administrations of the astressin-B, once each day for five days, the astressin-B appeared to have reversed the condition.\\nBut the researchers returned to the mice to find that the bald ones had regrown a very thick dark coat of fur. In another four months, the mice still had their full coats.\\nLead researcher, Million Mulugeta, explained that CRF releases several stress related hormones and that further research will identify which of these hormones is most directly related to hair loss. The team is optimistic about astressin-B as a future treatment for human hair loss.\\n“These hormones and their receptors are present in the skin both in mice and\\nhumans, and they are very similar,\" Mulageta told Voice of America News. \"So all this gives us hope that the\\nantagonist may work in human(s).”\\nMulageta doesn\\'t know, however, whether the treatment will succeed for those who have lost their hair due to non-stress related causes, such as chemotherapy.',\n",

By 9:30 we had finished our breakfast, walking the dog and a few chores and we took off in the Honda for an hours drive to Sioux City. Sioux City is on the border of Iowa and Nebraska, with most of the city being in Iowa.

Today is the first of a 2 day off period and we really didn’t have a plan for today.

We woke up to thunder and light rain at 7 am. I got up took a shower and made us bacon, eggs, toast and coffee. After a leisurely breakfast it was as if all hell broke loose. The thunder roared and roared and roared and with it the rain was coming down so hard that we could not see the lake. Then the first hail storm hit us. Luckily the size of the hail was under an inch around but it was pelting the RV with the heavy winds driving it.

       " {'text': 'Staring at my bookcase, I wonder when the education books began to outnumber the music scores. When exactly did I start to purchase teaching texts over aria compilations? What changed my goal from staring in Mozart operas to being Miss Kovach and teaching about Columbus, baking soda volcanoes, and multiplication? The important thing, however, is not how this change occurred but the simple fact that it did.\\nI came to love teaching through experience. Becoming a teacher was not something I planned. At first, teaching was simply an excuse to move to Hungary. I was ill prepared and had little knowledge of what teaching actually required. I had worked as a kindergarten assistant and taught a few preschool classes for an education course in college but those were little preparation for facing a classroom of middle school students. My first day was terrifying. I remember thinking “at least I never have to have another FIRST first day of teaching!” Despite my apprehension, I am proud of my accomplishments that first year as a teacher. Of course there were problems, but as a brand new teacher with little support, just making it through the year was a victory. Now in my second year as a full-time teacher, I have realized teaching is more than a means to an end. I love teaching and I want to obtain certification which will broaden my opportunities as well as help me become a better teacher who can inspire students to love learning.\\nThe certification program at University of Bridgeport is particularly appealing to me because of the internship part of the program. After spending two years as a teacher, I hope to continue to develop through experience as well as formal education. The opportunity to apply what I will be learning directly into my internship will be a better means of reinforcement than any test or paper could ever be. Additionally, I strongly believe that teachers have an obligation to be both educators and role models to their students. The opportunity to work with and learn from experienced teachers in my placement will provide very practical and applicable knowledge in these areas.\\nMy professional goal after completing my certification is to become a classroom teacher in an international school. Grades 2-4 are particularly appealing to me, because students are excited to learn and ready to continue building on the foundation created during nursery, kindergarten, and first grade. In my two years as an English teacher in Hungary, I have seen how important it is to be an ambassador for my country. I may be the only American my students ever meet so it is vital that I make a good impression. Additionally, the children in international schools have a special set of needs and, having lived outside of the US as a child, I understand what some of those challenges can be. With this certification and degree, I hope to be better equipped to educate and inspire my students.',\n",

Before the big premiere, go behind the scenes of one of Showtime’s most scandalous hits as they preview all the schemes, scams and scoundrels to come from another year in the Gallagher household. Get ‘Shameless’ with a new preview inside!\\nA drunk father smuggling himself back from Mexico, a genius-level degenerate with a mind-for mayhem, and as much dirt as one can possibly throw on Emmy Rossum can mean only one thing: the new season of ‘Shameless’ is nearly upon us! Showtime has issued a new behind-the-scenes featurette of our favorite pay-cable dysfunctional family, previewing all the depraved antics TV’s most shameless family will find themselves in this year when the show returns on January 13.\\nThe new season follows the Gallagher household some months after the season 2 finale, where Fiona (Emmy Rossum) is further along toward getting her G.E.D. and somewhat bored in her relationship with Jimmy (Justin Chatwin). Frank (William H. Macy) on the other hand finds himself with a new business venture in Mexico, but that’s far from the only scheme the family has cooked up. The new episodes will also boast appearances from former ‘The West Wing’ star Bradley Whitford.\\nCheck out the new ‘Shameless’ season 3 trailer below, and give us your predictions in the comments!',\n",

Diana died last year at the age of 84 and her husband Arthur died in 2002 at the age of 77.\\nThe LaMontagnes built the Blue Jay Motel at Hampton Beach, which they operated for 34 years before passing the business on to their daughter, Mary.\\n\"The LaMontagnes have always been a strong supporter and advocate for Hampton Beach,\" said Linda Gebhart, a member of the Hampton Beach Beautification Committee. \"They lived a life of service to our community and were wonderful role models. We wanted to do something to honor that.\"\\nArthur LaMontagne built the Blue Jay Motel in 1950 and served as a call fireman for the Hampton Beach Fire Department for 25 years.\\nDiana LaMontagne served as a precinct commissioner until she was elected as a selectwoman in 1978. She worked to bring the interests of the town and beach together.\\nOver the years, she volunteered her time to many groups, including the Beach Women\\'s Club and Stephen Ministries, an organization that assisted Hampton\\'s senior citizens and those who were battling illness.\\n\"She loved the community and would do anything she could to help,\" Gebhart said. \"Even when she was frail and not going out, she still kept active by watching all the board meetings. She wanted to be involved and wanted to know what was going on.\"\\nThe bench was donated by Edmund St. Pierre, who refurbished it from recycled granite curbing. A resident on M Street provided the tree, which was replanted last year. Gebhart said the blue spruce was chosen because Diana loved Christmas trees.\\nMary LaMontagne, Diana\\'s daughter, said the bench was a fitting tribute.\\nAt the unveiling, Mary shared with the group how her mother used to live on White\\'s Island, Maine until her family cottage was swept out to sea in the Great Flood of 1929.\\n\"My mother and her three siblings had to be rescued by the Coast Guard,\" Mary LaMontagne said. \"After that, my grandmother decided to no longer have oceanfront property. It\\'s a fitting tribute that the bench is at the state park. It\\'s like mom\\'s life has come full circle.\"\\nMary LaMontagne was so touched by the committee\\'s efforts she presented the group with a check for $400 to help with its beautification endeavors.',\n",

       " {'text': 'Author : Lowell Bradford\\nAstrophotography is the process of taking photos of objects in space. Whether photographing a celestial object visible with the naked eye, such as the moon or a group of stars, or astronomers photographing space with the Hubble telescope, photographing space is astrophotography. The practice of astrophotography does not date as far back as some other sciences, simply because it depends on photography. Photography didn’t become a viable invention until the early 19th century. The first case of astrophotography took place in 1840 when the moon was photographed for the first time. Over a century later, astrophotography is the method used to capture the world’s most phenomenal images of space. Astrophotography is available to everyone. From professional astronomers to the backyard skygazer, all can enjoy the wonders of astrophotography.\\nOverview of Astrophotography\\nThere are several methods used in astrophotography including various techniques, camera and video equipment, and various telescopes. Understanding the type of equipment used in astrophotography will help ensure you select the best methods for taking photos. The first thing to understand is that astrophotography is different from standard photography. Those accustomed to taking standard photos may find photographing celestial objects is more difficult than anticipated. Lighting, shadows, atmospheric changes, and the distance of heavenly objects must be taken into account to ensure the best photos are captured.\\nTelescopes should be adjusted to accommodate for the rotation of the earth. This is accomplished by setting equipment to rotate in an opposite manner from earth. Telescope mounts are an important device used in astrophotography that ensures photos captured are precisely timed and accurately track heavenly objects. Preventing tracking errors is vital to successful astrophotography and there are modern-day breakthroughs in computer science that helps make that happen.\\nAstrophotography is one of the oldest forms of science-based photography. Beginning in the 19th century, early astrophotography consisted of photographing the moon, stars, eclipses, and nebulas. The procedure requires long exposure and early images were known for being quite blurry. It was not uncommon for telescopes to lose power, focus, or direction during a prolonged photo shoot.\\nThe earliest astrophotography photos captured were of the moon, followed by the sun and stars. It wasn’t until the early 20th century that astrophotography began to become an important scientific research method. The invention of refracting telescopes enabled more powerful imaging to be captured. As the 20th century progressed, new telescopes such as the Hale, Samuel Oschin, and Hubble revolutionized the art of professional astrophotography. By the late 20th century, new telescopes and equipment allowed for some of the most awe-inspiring space photos to be captured for the first time in history.\\nWhile astrophotography is an important tool used in scientific applications, it is also a popular hobby. Advances in video equipment, standard, and digital cameras have enabled the backyard enthusiast to capture amazing photos. Computer software makes it possible to take photos that appear as though a professional took them. From the novice to the advanced hobbyist, everyone can enjoy the art and science of astrophotography.\\nA variety of media devices and equipment setups are used. Examples include video and webcams, CCD, over-the-counter cameras, single lens and digital single lens cameras. Computer software may be used to adjust cameras and telescopes to zoom in on certain objects then take pictures. Photos taken may be edited in image processing software, for a clearer picture.

       " {'text': 'Cluster has spent a decade revealing previously hidden interactions between the Sun and Earth. Its studies have uncovered secrets of aurora, solar storms, and given us insight into fundamental processes that occur across the Universe. And there is more work to do.\\nThe aurora, those dancing lights in the polar skies, are but the visible manifestation of an invisible battle taking place above our heads. Supersonic particles from the Sun collide with our planet\\'s magnetic field every day. Most are deflected away but some are trapped by Earth\\'s magnetism and accelerated to collide with the atmosphere, creating the aurora, the planet\\'s radiation belts and from time to time large magnetic storms worldwide.\\nIn its decade studying this activity, Cluster has discovered giant magnetic whirlpools injecting new particles into Earth\\'s field, huge \\'holes\\' in the uppermost atmosphere of Earth that create black regions in the visible aurora, and magnetic dead spots called nulls that form just as the magnetic landscape of space is about to snap into a new configuration.\\n\"Cluster has shown us a previously hidden world of new details,\" says Philippe Escoubet, ESA Cluster Mission Manager. As well as understanding the aurora, Cluster has a practical side: it unveils the environment that spacecraft such as navigation and communications satellites are expected to work in. Solar particles can damage spacecraft electronics, sometimes critically, so Cluster\\'s characterisation of this danger can lead to more robust satellite design.\\nThere is a global science community working on Cluster. Every other day, a science team somewhere in the world has a paper accepted for publication that relies on Cluster data. The Cluster Active Archive already possesses more than 1000 users worldwide, ensuring that the science results will continue even after the mission itself comes to an end.\\nTen years is a long time in the severe condition of space. The four Cluster spacecraft are all showing their age and the operations team face a daily challenge to keep the fleet operational. Perhaps the biggest task is to make sure the power keep flowing.\\nThe solar panels no longer generate as much electricity as they did, and the batteries onboard are gradually breaking down in a dramatic way: a series of minor explosions. The batteries are made of non-magnetic silver-cadmium to avoid interfering with Cluster\\'s instruments. But over time, such batteries generate oxyhydrogen, an explosive gas. To date seven batteries have cracked across the four spacecraft, two of which were more like small explosions. Ground controllers saw the spacecraft lurch each time this happened. From twenty batteries, just nine remain. Yet new, creative scenarios for operations mean the spacecraft remain almost fully functional despite the loss of battery power.\\nAnd there is a lot still to be done. Recently, Cluster\\'s approach to Earth was lowered from 19 000 km to just several hundred kilometres. This will sweep Cluster through the regions responsible for the final acceleration of auroral particles, giving scientists an unparalleled view of this behaviour.\\nWhilst Cluster is firmly in orbit around the Earth, its science is fundamental to our understanding of the most distant realms of the Universe.\\n\"We are doing astrophysics close to home,\" says David Southwood, ESA Director of Science and Robotic Exploration, \"Beyond the solar system is an enormous Universe, filled with uncountable stars. The spaces in between them are full of magnetic fields. Other missions study the objects – the islands in the universal ocean – but Cluster studies the very ocean itself.\"\\nCluster is expected to operate until 2012. A mission extension is under review to extend its operations to 2014.',\n",

       " {'text': '\"Mr. President, you\\'re entitled to your own airplane and your own house,\" Mitt Romney said at the first presidential debate in Denver earlier this month, \"but not your own facts.\"\\nThis play on the late Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan\\'s famous quote, \"Everyone is entitled to his own opinion, but not to his own facts,\" is normally true. But not this month. Not when it comes to economic facts at least.\\nOn the first Friday of this month, the Labor Department published results from two surveys that depicted two completely different economic realities in the United States. Which report Americans choose to believe will go a long way in determining who will win the election next month.\\nThe report most favorable to President Obama, the Bureau of Labor Statistics\\' Current Population Survey (aka the household survey), found that 873,000 Americans got new jobs last month. That is the most jobs created ever reported by the household survey since 1983. And it is the sole reason the nation\\'s unemployment went from 8.1 percent down to 7.8 percent.\\nHow credible is that 873,000 jobs created number? As Wells Fargo analysts noted, September\\'s supposed household survey jobs gain was \"more than four times the size of the average change over the past 12 months.\" The last time the U.S. economy created that many jobs, in June of 1983, the economy was growing at 9.3 percent. Today, GDP is growing at just 1.3 percent.\\nWells Fargo referred to the 873,000 jobs growth number as \"a black swan outlier.\" Gallup\\'s chief economist, Dennis Jacobe, said the household survey \"seems to lack face-validity.\" This is what economic experts are saying about the economic report that Obama is using to make his closing argument to the American people.\\nMeanwhile the report less favorable to Obama, the Bureau of Labor Statistics\\' Current Employment Statistics program (aka the employer survey), showed just 114,000 jobs created in September. Not only was this report almost perfectly in line with what analysts were expecting, it was also consistent with what other economic indicators have been showing: Instead of getting better, the U.S. economy is actually getting worse. (For reference, when the household survey showed nearly a million new jobs were created in June 1983, the employer survey did not diverge nearly as much, pointing to 418,000 new jobs.)\\nSince the economy stopped losing jobs in October 2010, we have been averaging 150,000 jobs created per month, according to the employer survey. But over the last six months, job growth has slowed to just 106,000 jobs a month. The Atlanta Federal Reserve estimates that we need 100,000 new jobs a month just to keep up with population growth. That means if the current rate of weak job growth continues, roughly 8 percent unemployment is the new normal. Worse, if the rate of net job creation continues to slow, as it has been doing for months, unemployment will tick up again.\\nSo which report should voters believe? The household survey, showing rates of job creation not seen since the height of the Reagan recovery? Or the employer survey, showing the U.S. economy slowly sinking into another recession?\\nDemocrats have clearly decided to trust the household survey data. According to Gallup, consumer confidence has skyrocketed to prerecession levels ... but interestingly, only among Democrats. Consumer confidence among Republicans and independents is actually falling. And with good reason.\\nIf Obama is re-elected president, the American people are facing a $500 billion tax hike starting Jan. 1, which the Tax Policy Center estimates would translate into a $3,500 tax hike for the average American family. The payroll tax hike alone, which Obama and the Democrats have specifically said they will let happen, would take $1000 a year from the average American paycheck -- from the poor and rich alike. The Congressional Budget Office predicts that these tax hikes, along with $100 billion in scheduled spending cuts, would cause unemployment to shoot back up above 9 percent.\\nThat\\'s economic reality no American wants to be part of.\\nConn Carroll (firstname.lastname@example.org) is a senior editorial writer for The Washington Examiner.

       " {'text': 'A website is like an expensive box of chocolates. The outer carton may have a satin finish, the letters embossed in copper foil, the edges die-cut love-hearts and the whole lot wrapped in a purple satin ribbon. Gorgeous! Who cares? Let me at the chocolate!\\nSay that pretty box did its job and enticed the browser to buy. How happy will he be with the purchase if its contents are past the sell by date, the chocolates covered in mold and the sweet centres fermented and rotten. Eeew.\\nThe same is true of a company site. The outer design may be picture perfect but if there is no website content strategy the material it contains may leave a lot to be desired. As a content marketing agency, Webdirexion helps our clients reach their clients and typically one of the first items to address is the client’s website or blog.\\nIs Your Website Stale?\\n“If your website is under performing and you have been focusing on tweaking the design it may be time to take a step back and see how well your content is meeting expectations.”\\nBy the time they reach out to us, it is not unusal for the company website to have become stale. Perhaps someone breathing the rarified air of the C-Level suite decided that what the company really needed was a website. Without too much discussion with the underlings in the marketing department an expensive designer was brought in and a shiny new website built. Eventually with great enthusiasm the new site was launched upon an unsuspecting public … and it sank like a stone.\\nPerhaps there had been great intentions in the beginning to keep the site updated but without a clear content strategy and lines of governance, this initiative soon withered on the vine. Unfortunately because a website is such a visual medium, people often make the mistake of elevating the importance of the visual impact of the site and devaluing or failing to consider the importance of its creative content. Of course, it is essential that the site design should reflect well upon the corporate brand, but a site’s livery has nothing at all to do with its effectiveness in the search engines or the import of the information it presents.\\nQuite frankly a website can be plain ugly and visitors will still beat a path to its door if the content it provides has value. Don’t believe me? What about Craigslist and Wikipedia? They have got to be two of the least visually appealing sites on the web but both provide such a treasure trove of information that they are ranked amongst the most visited websites in the world.\\nThe Internet is Broken!\\nIf after the initial disappointing launch someone in the head office does not take an interest and investigate why this expensive new marketing tool is not proving itself, it is possible that the blame for the poor ROI will simply be placed upon the internet itself.\\n- “Perhaps all that hype about what a great marketing tool it is is just a load of hot air?”\\n- “The internet is not effective for our industry.”\\n- “There is already too much competition out there on the internet. You have to have deep pockets to compete with that.”\\nAnyone who has worked in internet marketing will have heard these statements and more. the frustrating thing is, they are always entirely wrong. The internet is a great marketing tool. It can be effective for any industry and the problem is not the quantity of competition but in the quality of your message.\\nContent Must Meeting Expectations\\nForest Gump’s analogy compares life to a box of chocolates in as much as “…you never know what you are gonna get.” I guess that is true if you did not pay any attention to the wrapping. But if you bought that box expecting a selection of soft-centred liqueurs and instead ended up with a run of the mill box of assoted fondants then I think you would be disappointed. A visitor to your site would be equally disappointed if he landed there enticed with the prospect of practical and informative content and instead got a run of the mill rehash of sales collateral.\\nIf your website is under performing and you have been focusing on tweaking the design it may be time to take a step back and see how well your content is meeting expectations. Does it go beyond the sales hype to really outline your product and services? Does it reach out to and attract your target client with well researched and presented articles. Does it provide content created not to sell but to enlighten, inspire, interest…?\\nIs it Time for an Audit?\\nIt is hard to look at a creative project, especially one that you have been close to for a long time, objectively. That’s why the editor role is so important as a critical eye prior to hitting the go button. When considering your website’s effectiveness, step back and ask others outwith your company to describe their experience with the site. Or go a step further and order a website review from Webdirexion. We offer a Content Marketing Audit , Site Fix or Review Consultation.

However, the Lakers were actually on the tail end of back-to-back games having won in Minnesota last night, but still managed to have seven more assists, four more steals, four more blocks, and shot a better percentage from the field than the Nuggets.\\nSure, AI may have won the individual battle with 51 points, eight assists, two rebounds, and a steal in comparison to Kobe’s 25 points, eight rebounds, five assists, two steals, and a block. But, it was the Lakers team defense that found a way to hold him to a mere two points in the fourth quarter along with only allowing the Nuggets to score 19 collectively to win the war. Furthermore, it was the Laker bench and supporting cast where the rest of tonight’s slack was made up. The Lakers had two other twenty-point scorers in Derek Fisher (20) and Vladimir Radmanovic (21) compared to the Nuggets only having Carmelo Anthony (26) reach the twenty-point mark. Plus, the Laker reserves outscored the Nuggets reserves, 35-20.\\nAnd the Nuggets were not without their chance to win this game, but when Allen Iverson couldn’t do it all himself in the final minutes and turned to his fellow Nuggets for help nobody was home. With only three minutes to play, the Nuggets were leading, 102-99, before allowing the Lakers to go on a 12-5 run as if they just didn’t have enough gas in the tank to close the game out. Kobe Bryant scored the next six points for the Lakers after a Radmanovic free-throw tied the game. Carmelo then proceeded to have two lay-ups thoroughly erased by Andrew Bynum and missed a three-point attempt. Leaving the Nuggets no choice but to foul the NBA’s second leading free-throw shooter, Derek Fisher, and have to endure the agony that is having to watch him ice the game from charity stripe.\\nMy only other mentionable note about this game was Marcus Camby recording his sixth twenty-plus rebounding effort of the season with an even 20 boards tonight. But, the harsh reality still reamains that he didn’t give the Nuggets much of anything else by not scoring a single point and only blocking one shot in 40 minutes of action.\\nNow the 11-8 Nuggets have to travel to Dallas to play the 12-7 Mavericks tomorrow night on the backside of back-to-back games.

It is a summary of the 2011 season, and it brings back some memories from a tremendous five-month.\\nThe RoughRiders’ Run to the Playoffs\\nFor the sixth time in franchise history, the RoughRiders are in the Texas League playoffs. Find out how the ‘Riders reached this point in our season rewind.\\nA Texas League season is a grind, with long trips, steamy temperatures, and few breaks. It is a long journey with peaks and valleys. Here in the RoughRiders’ ninth season, there were enough peaks for Frisco to enjoy playoff baseball for the sixth time.\\nApril was a struggle for second-year skipper Steve Buechele’s club. The ‘Riders finished the month in the South Division’s basement at 8-14. The signature moment of the rough April was quite a notable one, though. Martin Perez, the Rangers’ top prospect, tossed a rain-shortened perfect game at Arkansas April 19.\\nBy May 13, the ‘Riders worked their way back to the .500 mark. Later in the month, Frisco staked its claim to second place with a four-game sweep of Midland at Dr Pepper Ballpark. From this point on, the ‘Riders spent more time in second place than any other team in the Texas League.\\nThe RoughRiders received some temporary help in May. Last year’s American League Most Valuable Player Josh Hamilton hit a home run during his two-day rehab stint in Frisco. Nelson Cruz also graced the middle of the ‘Riders’ order for three games while battling back from an injury. Big name pitchers like Neftali Feliz, Tommy Hunter and Brandon Webb rehabbed in Frisco, too.\\nAlso, outfielder Leonys Martin made his stateside debut with the RoughRiders after the Rangers inked Martin to a $15.5 million dollar contract. Martin hit .348 in 29 games with the ‘Riders before heading to Triple-A Round Rock.\\nFrisco finished the first half strongly, but a 40-30 mark was not good enough to notch a division championship after San Antonio’s 49-win showing. Individually, Tommy Mendonca was the star of the show in June. Mendonca was the Texas League’s Player of the Month after boasting a .375 batting average and driving in 30 runs.\\nJuly was a month for the record books in Frisco. The ‘Riders matched a franchise-high in runs in their 19-4 thumping of Corpus Christi July 22. Mendonca hit three of the RoughRiders’ record-setting eight home runs.\\nOne week later, Joe Wieland became the first RoughRider to single-handedly throw a nine-inning no-hitter at San Antonio. Less than 48 hours after the no-no, the Rangers dealt Wieland and Robbie Erlin to San Diego for big league reliever Mike Adams. As a result, the former Frisco duo joined San Antonio’s loaded rotation.\\nThe RoughRiders spent the month of August holding off Midland for a playoff berth. They officially clinched a spot in the season’s final week, a few days after the ‘Riders took three of four from their first round opponent—San Antonio.\\nOver the course of 140 games, the ‘Riders played well enough to earn a chance to vie for the Texas League’s richest prize. The club has been among the best in the league in most categories this season, and Frisco is well positioned to have a September to remember for the first time since 2004—the franchise’s first and only championship season.\\nThe RoughRiders have won regularly here in 2011, and now only six playoff wins separate the ‘Riders from a title.\\nIn case you missed it, the RoughRiders have clinched a playoff spot for the sixth time in franchise history. Frisco will square off with San Antonio in the first round beginning September 7.\\nHow have the ‘Riders fared in the playoffs over the years? Here are the year-by-year results.\\nDivisional Round: Defeated Wichita 3-0\\nChampionship Series: Lost to San Antonio 4-1\\nIn the RoughRiders’ first season, they qualified for the playoffs and made quick work of the Wranglers in the first round. In 2003, like this season, San Antonio was an all-timer of a team. The Missions went 88-51 in the regular season and cruised past the ‘Riders for the title.\\nDivisional Round: Defeated Tulsa 3-0\\nChampionship Series: Defeated Round Rock 4-1\\nAfter a third-place finish in the first half, the RoughRiders blew away the competition en route to their first and only Texas League championship. Frisco went 45-25 in the second half to punch its playoff ticket. In their three-game sweep of Tulsa, the ‘Riders scored 28 runs. In the championship series against Round Rock, Frisco’s pitching staff gave up only 20 runs. This remains the lone banner in the RoughRiders’ tenure in the Texas League.\\nDivisional Round: Lost to San Antonio 3-0\\nFollowing their title in 2004, the RoughRiders missed the playoffs in ’05 and ’06. They made up for lost time with a record of 85-55 during the 2007 regular season, which was ten games better than any other team in the Texas League. However, the ‘Riders did not translate their regular season success into the playoffs. The Missions outscored Frisco 19-8 in the sweep. San Antonio went on to win the TL title.\\nDivisional Round: Defeated San Antonio 3-0\\nChampionship Series: Lost to Arkansas 3-2\\nFor the second straight season, the ‘Riders posted the best record in the Texas League (84-56). This time, the ‘Riders made quick work of San Antonio in the first round. In fact, Frisco’s sweep of San Antonio was more lopsided than the Missions’ broom job in ’07, as the ‘Riders outscored the defending champs 20-5. The championship series went back and forth, with Frisco taking Game 2 and Game 4. However, the Travelers dominated the deciding Game 5 11-3 to win their first outright title since 1989.\\nDivisional Round: Lost to Midland 3-1\\nSkipper Steve Buechele led the RoughRiders to the playoffs in his first season at the helm, but the RockHounds won back-to-back games at home after the two clubs split the two games at Dr Pepper Ballpark. Midland lost to Northwest Arkansas in the championship series.\\nAll-Time Record (Games): 17-14\\nAll-Time Record (Series): 4-4\\nThe 2011 Texas League Postseason All-Star ballots are out to managers and media members, and both Aaron and I have a vote. Below, I have my picks along with a brief explanation why.\\nFirst off, here are a few notes. As a member of the RoughRiders organization, I cannot vote for a RoughRider. Still, I have included six ‘Riders who could be on this list. Also, anyone who has played in the TL this year is eligible. Finally, all of the ballots are due by tomorrow, so the last two weeks of the season do not factor into the decision.\\nShare your thoughts at the bottom in the comments section. Here we go.\\nCatcher: Wilin Rosario (Tulsa)\\nThe Rockies’ number two prospect, Rosario has not had the best season offensively. But, he could get a September promotion to Colorado and he has put up the best numbers of any Texas League catcher (.254, 18 HR, 41 RBI).\\nFirst Baseman: Matt Adams (Springfield)\\nWith Tim Wheeler’s recent struggles and Jermaine Mitchell’s promotion to Triple-A Sacramento, Adams has an outside shot at a Triple Crown. Adams has a league-leading 30 homers (one better than Wheeler) and 94 RBIs, and he is sixth in the league in average at .313. However, the top three (Mitchell, J.D. Martinez and James Darnell) will not have enough plate appearances to qualify barring a return to the TL. His real target is Mike Trout (.326).\\nSecond Baseman: Jose Altuve (Corpus Christi)\\nI like to steer away from players who did not spend much time in a league for postseason awards, but the second base spot is weak here in the Texas League and Altuve was incredible to watch. He hit .361 in his 35 games with Corpus Christi. During that short stint, Altuve drove in 25 runs and scored 21.\\nShortstop: Darwin Perez (Arkansas)\\nShortstop is a fairly weak position in the Texas League this season, as well, so Perez is my choice because of his on-base percentage (.378, 11th), stolen bases (22, 6th) and fielding percentage (.982, 1st among qualifiers). If I could vote for a RoughRider, Renny Osuna would be my choice here.\\nThird Baseman: James Darnell (San Antonio)\\nWith apologies to Arkansas’ Luis Jimenez, Darnell was a machine in his 76 games with the Missions. Darnell hit .333, which still qualifies for third in the Texas League, and he had an OPS of 1.038. Darnell hit 17 homers and drove in 62 runs, and now his home is San Diego.\\nOutfielder: Mike Trout (Arkansas)\\nTrout was advertised as the number one or number two prospect in the minors at the start of the season, and he has not disappointed. Trout is hitting .326 with 33 stolen bases, and he earned a brief stint in the big leagues. He is incredibly fun to watch.\\nOutfielder: Jermaine Mitchell (Midland)\\nMitchell still qualifies as the league’s leader in batting average (.355), on-base percentage (.453) and OPS (1.042). He didn’t have the gaudy home run (10) or RBI (50) totals, but he was a menace atop Midland’s order.\\nOutfielder: Tim Wheeler (Tulsa)\\nWheeler has struggled lately (.200, 0 HR, 2 RBIs in August), but you have to wonder if he is getting bored at the Double-A level. He is still second in homers (29) and tied for fourth in RBIs (79). It was between Corpus Christi’s J.D. Martinez and Wheeler, and I went with Tulsa’s leadoff hitter, who is putting up middle-of-the-order stats. Don’t worry, Martinez fans…\\nDesignated Hitter: J.D. Martinez (Corpus Christi)\\nThe Hooks have the worst record in the Texas League, but they are one of three teams to have two offensive representatives on my list. Martinez, like Jose Altuve, is in the big leagues now, but he is fourth in the TL in OPS (.959) and seventh in RBIs (72) despite only playing in 88 games.\\nThree toughest offensive omissions:\\n1. Arkansas 3B Luis Jimenez (barely edged by Darnell and Martinez)\\n2. Springfield OF Alex Castellanos (gave Wheeler edge despite being in recent funk)\\n3. San Antonio OF Blake Tekotte (outfield was the most loaded position)\\nThree most likely RoughRiders on the list:\\n1. Renny Osuna (2B/SS)\\n2. Tommy Mendonca (3B)\\n3. Leonys Martin (OF)\\n1. Matt Shoemaker (Arkansas)\\nShoemaker started the season in Triple-A, but he came down to the Texas League in early May and began his dominance. He leads the league, by a wide margin, in ERA (2.18) and WHIP (1.00) among qualifiers. He also paces all Texas Leaguers in strikeouts with 121 and is tied at the top with 12 wins.\\n2. Garrett Richards (Arkansas)\\nRichards is the man who is deadlocked with Shoemaker in wins. Both hurlers are 12-2, and Richards is the league leader in innings with 141. Richards, who is currently with the Angels, is 12-2 with an ERA of 3.06, which is second to Shoemaker among qualifiers.\\n3. Dallas Keuchel (Corpus Christi)\\nDon’t let his 9-7 record fool you—Keuchel has been a legitimate ace all season long. The lefty has worked through five innings in all but one of his 19 starts, and he has only surrendered more than three runs four times. He is not overpowering (76 strikeouts in 127 2/3 innings), but he is second among qualifiers in WHIP at 1.12.\\n4. Joe Wieland (San Antonio)\\nCasey Kelly is San Diego’s top prospect, and Jorge Reyes has the best numbers of any San Antonio starter who has been on the club all year. However, who has made a bigger impact in the Texas League this season than Wieland? Wieland tossed a no-hitter with the RoughRiders against San Antonio, and then he went to the Missions. Wieland’s ERA is 1.50 in Double-A, and he has a 1.85 overall this season.\\n5. Nick Vincent (San Antonio)\\nVincent has made more appearances (58) than anyone else in the Texas League. The reliever is 7-1 with a 2.19 ERA in 70 innings, and he has 82 strikeouts to 14 walks. In the eighth inning, the righty owns a 1.91 ERA. In the ninth, that mark falls to 1.50. The Missions have been dominant all year long, and the bullpen is a big reason why.\\n6. Brad Brach (San Antonio)\\nClosers are not that common in the minors, but Brach was the man who dominated the ninth inning while in San Antonio. Brach had a 2.25 ERA and went 23 for 25 in save opportunities with the Missions before earning a promotion to Triple-A Tucson. When ahead in the count, the TL’s save leader held his opposition to an .097 average (7-for-72).\\nThree toughest pitching omissions:\\n1. Springfield’s Shelby Miller (good numbers, but not good enough to overcome small sample size)\\n2. Tulsa’s Juan Nicasio (better numbers than Miller, but fewer innings)\\n3. San Antonio’s Jorge Reyes (4th in ERA, but only worked more than five innings once)\\nThree most likely RoughRiders on the list:\\n1. LHP Martin Perez\\n2. RHP Justin Miller\\n3. RHP Tyler Tufts\\nPLAYER OF THE YEAR: Springfield’s Matt Adams\\nHe is the most dangerous hitter in the Texas League right now, and he has a chance at the Triple Crown. He may not have the upside that some other players in this league possess, but he has been the best hitter on the best offense, by far, in the TL.\\nON THE MEDAL STAND: 2. Arkansas’ Mike Trout; 3. San Antonio’s James Darnell.\\nPITCHER OF THE YEAR: Arkansas’ Matt Shoemaker\\nThe Travelers earned a first-half title because of their pitching staff, and Shoemaker has been the go-to guy. Shoemaker stumbled a bit in Triple-A earlier this season, but he figures to do much better in his second go-around at that level after an incredible season at the Double-A level.\\nON THE MEDAL STAND: 2. Arkansas’ Garrett Richards; 3. Corpus Christi’s Dallas Keuchel.\\nMANAGER OF THE YEAR: San Antonio’s Doug Dascenzo\\nThe Missions have the best record in minor league baseball, and they have had many good players. However, Dascenzo has navigated his club through many promotions, and they haven’t slowed down at all. This San Antonio club is a dominant force that will go into the playoffs as the heavy favorites, and Dascenzo is a big reason why.\\nON THE MEDAL STAND: 2. Frisco’s Steve Buechele; 3. Northwest Arkansas’ Brian Poldberg.\\nWe continue to receive tremendous support every day with the ‘Riders Insider Blog, and it is greatly appreciated. We have posted plenty of content about the RoughRiders both on and off the field, and we wanted to take a look back at ten of our most popular posts from the last few weeks.\\nBecoming Martin Perez (July 15): A look at how Martin Perez became the top prospect in the Rangers’ system during his two-year stint in Frisco.\\nThe ‘Riders Driver (July 21): Carlos Coleman is the man behind the wheel for the RoughRiders on every road trip.

We are always looking for more ideas!\\nThanks for following along, everyone!\\nNote: This is a running diary of a typical day in the life of the RoughRiders’ media department. The updates are available in chronological order, so scroll down for the latest updates.\\n10:45 p.m. Sunday (all of us): Well after the RoughRiders’ 6-5 victory over the San Antonio Missions, the media department departs Dr Pepper Ballpark. The game story is up, the information is distributed to local media, the equipment is packed, and the lights are off. We will be back here before we know it.\\n1:00 a.m. (Brian): I’m the night owl of the group, it seems. After a quick bite to eat following the game, I sit down and prepare the content for PlayBall! The text is already set to go for today’s edition, but I need to turn in the draft for Wednesday’s edition. In order to get the PlayBall! programs ready for each home game, much of the content is due 2-3 days in advance.\\nOnce I sent that to Alex, our terrific graphic designer and an avid reader of the blog, I’m done for the night. Aaron will be with you early, and I’ll follow shortly after as we continue to give you an inside look at our day-to-day life. We’ll have pictures and everything, so enjoy!\\n10:30 a.m. (Aaron): After waking up around 9 a.m. and saying goodbye to my wife Heather who left earlier this morning for work, it’s time to start working on tonight’s game notes. This is a daily task that virtually every broadcaster in the minors deals with. These notes are used by both the home and road broadcaster along with visiting media, scouts, etc. It’s about 13 pages of news, stats, bios, and trends. The idea is that you can flip through the notes and have a pretty good idea what that team has been up to lately, even if you haven’t seen them play. We always post our notes to our website as well.\\n11:14 a.m. (Aaron): Notes are taking longer today because we have a new starter tonight, Derek Hankins. I’ve just finished looking up all his career stats and bio information. I use information to make a dedicated page in our games that focuses on the starting pitcher. It’s always exciting getting a new starter, but it means a longer day for the game notes to create and format the pitcher’s page.\\n11:30 a.m. (Brian): I woke up around 10 a.m., ate some breakfast, and caught up on e-mails for a bit. The first job every day for me is to update the web site. The best part about the “newsroom” that allows us to post, archive, update, etc., is the “cheetah.” While the site is in the process of generating, we are greeted to the running cheetah that you see to your left. Once I’m done with updating the story, the game story will be down, a few new exciting RoughRiders promos will be on the home page, and the “Extra Bases Chat” will be ready to go for tonight’s series finale.\\n12:27 p.m. (Aaron): Game notes are done. I sometimes stand up and wave pom-poms when this is completed. I mentally have a hard time moving on with my day until I know this is behind me. In addition to writing them, I’ve also emailed them out to our distribution list that includes media members from around Dallas-Fort Worth, the Rangers, and their affiliates. After I emailed the notes out in PDF form, I then posted them to our website. The cheetah must have had a light breakfast, he (she?) ran pretty fast for me.\\n12:45 p.m. (Brian): Everything online is updated, and a few new promotions are available for viewing at ridersbaseball.com. Now, the goal is to get ready for some possible history at Dr Pepper Ballpark tonight. With two hits yesterday, shortstop Renny Osuna is tied with Steve Murphy for the all-time hit lead in Frisco history.\\nThis means that Osuna is one hit away from setting a very important record. As a result, we are preparing for it now. We already have a script for John Clemens, the “Voice of Dr Pepper Ballpark,” to read if/when Osuna breaks the record. Also, Alex has designed an image for us to put on the home page of our website. The sneak peak to that image is to the left. Now, time to get ready and head into the office for all of the tasks at the stadium. First pitch time is in about six hours!\\n2:00 p.m. (Brian): I am alone in the office right now, but Stephen came in here earlier today to print out rosters and stat packs. Stat packs are distributed to all managers, coaches and media members, and they contain overall stats, situational stats, the Texas League’s daily report, and much more. For a stat nerd like me, it is an important part of my preparation.\\nNow, it’s time to get the lineups set to go. We have already received Frisco’s lineup from skipper Steve Buechele. It looks pretty similar to what we’ve seen from him lately, especially because the club only has one extra player right now (Jose Felix is the odd man out today).\\nI remember when I first started covering baseball, I thought that the lineup card would be very formal and magical. Well, you can be the judge. And don’t get your hopes up.\\n2:30 p.m. (Brian): After enjoying some free pizza in our conference room (always a sign of a good day), it’s time to start getting our paperwork around to both teams and to the press box. We’ve nicknamed our printer “T.K.” and it is very busy during this part of the day. Once the printing is done, I’ll walk it up to the booth in the chilly North Texas weather. By that point, our whole force will be in here getting ready for tonight’s game!\\n2:33 p.m. (Aaron): Once the notes were done I got some lunch and did some work around the house. Trying to have a marriage and work in minor league baseball is a tough assignment. Like all of us, I’m at the ballpark eight nights a week and am out of town so often it’s hard to be very helpful at home. My wife Heather does so much for us in-season I try to help out when I can. Once I got caught up on some emails, I picked up the house (my messes, of course), emptied the dishwasher, paid some bills, and did some general husbandly duties that I (rarely) excel at.\\n3:15 p.m. (Brian): The RoughRiders’ media quartet is in the office to prepare for the game this evening, which is actually Frisco’s 26th straight day with a game. Reid is filing away with some “clippings,” which are used to document how much outside coverage the RoughRiders get. Stephen is working on a blog for tomorrow on a “behind the scenes” look at Dr Pepper Ballpark. I am doing this blog and writing a feature for Sports Page Dallas.\\nAaron appears to have the most important job of all. It is easy to lose track of things during the grind of a minor league season, and one thing that slipped all of our minds was our “recycle box.” As you can see on the left, it was quite full today when Aaron decided to usher in the off day tomorrow with a clean recycle box. Admirable.\\nTo be honest, I’m not sure if that bad will be able to hold all of the paper for the long term, but it is worth a shot. Three hours until the pre-game show. Plenty of work to do!\\n4:20 p.m. (Brian): By this time of the day, everyone is gearing up for the game in their own way. For me, as the pre- and post-game show host, I need to be prepared for the Texas League and Texas Rangers’ scoreboard. To do that, I keep some updated information on each game within the league. The sheet I used was featured back in this blog post.\\nI will also pre-record an intro for the top of the pre-game show, which features a highlight from the previous night. To record, I use a nifty-looking program called “Adobe Audition,” which you can see to your right. Plenty of green, which is my favorite color.\\n4:35 p.m. (Brian): We just found out about the pitching situation for tonight. Derek Hankins will pitch no more than four innings, and then Richard Bleier will work behind the newest ‘Rider. Hopefully this duo can give Frisco’s ‘pen a much-deserved night off this evening!\\n4:45 p.m. (Aaron): Each day I try to talk with some of the guys in the clubhouse and find out some information for the broadcast. Some days it’s nothing more than pointless chatter (like when I talk with our trainer, Carlos Olivas). Other times I get some good stuff. Along with Carlos, today I checked in with our pitching coach Jeff Andrews. He gave me the game plan for tonight that Brian mentioned about regarding how many innings Hankins will go. Normally this time of night I’m finding someone to interview for our pre-game show. However, I already recorded my interview with Robbie Erlin yesterday to play on tonight’s pre-game. Now all I have to worry about is getting dinner and filling out my scorebook.\\n5:20 p.m. (Brian): Speaking of dinner, everyone in the office was treated to some Sonny Bryan’s barbeque before the game. As we were eating, clubhouse manager CJ Allen came into our four-person office and offered up some of his delicious lasagna that was left over from the RoughRiders’ clubhouse. So, the ‘Riders’ baseball and media teams have been fueled by the same dinner tonight!\\n5:45 p.m. (Brian): Wonder what happens before the gates open? Well, after arriving in the press box a bit ago, we have been treated to some warmups by “The Crew” and some of San Antonio’s batting practice. Oftentimes, the evening’s national anthem singer will give it a whirl before fans enter the stadium.\\nAlso, if you are looking to collect a baseball from a Double-A game, try to get to Dr Pepper Ballpark early. There are always a handful of baseballs in the outfield berm following batting practice. I saw a few bombs sail out of here this afternoon. Always a nice way to get a fun souvenir.\\n6:10 p.m. (Brian): Above is a view from our press box, the highest press box in the Texas League. First pitch is less than an hour away, and our pre-game begins in 25 minutes!\\n6:35 p.m. (Brian): The pre-game show has begun! You can listen live at this link. We will still update this periodically throughout the night. After all, we promised 24 hours of the RoughRiders!\\n7:13 p.m. (Brian): Renny Osuna’s first chance at history tonight resulted in a strikeout at the hands of Robbie Erlin, the former RoughRider and tonight’s starter for San Antonio. Osuna is still one hit away from the all-time record, so he’ll get a few more chances tonight.\\n8:00 p.m. (Brian): So far, the ‘Riders lead 1-0 in what has been a good game. Aaron calls the play-by-play in the first, second, fifth, sixth and ninth innings, while I take the rest. So, I’m off the air until our scoreboard update at the end of the fifth. Plenty of great action tonight in the Texas League and in the Rangers’ system.\\n8:46 p.m. (Aaron): Was really fun to watch Robbie pitch again tonight. Too bad for him he allowed the only run so far over 6.2 innings tonight. Brian has the play-by-play now until the ninth inning.\\n9:07 p.m. (Brian): What a change of events in this one tonight. The ‘Riders go from up one to down one in the top of the eighth. Now, Reid is scrambling to change up his game recap, and Aaron is cutting up the highlights. It is much more work here in the booth when the game is close, and that’s what we have tonight!\\n9:41 p.m. (Brian): A late rally propelled the Missions to a 3-1, series-clinching victory over the RoughRiders tonight at Dr Pepper Ballpark. Unfortunately, the loss did not bring with it any history. Renny Osuna finished 0-for-4, so his hits record will have to wait at least another game.\\nWhile the crowd leaves, our work continues. Aaron is busy cutting up the highlights while I prepare for the “Scoreboard Show” that follows every game. Reid is working on the game story for the website, and Stephen is wrapping up the Extra Bases Chat and getting a head start on game notes for Wednesday. The night is almost over for us after another busy Monday.\\n10:15 p.m. (Brian): My night is pretty much over, outside of overseeing the posting of the game story. I just signed off on the Scoreboard Show, and Reid is about done with the story. The end is most certainly near.\\n10:30 p.m. (Brian): The game story is posted. The booth is clean. The media are alerted. The night is over. Almost 24 hours after we left last night, and 2,229 words later, our day is over. Thanks so much for following along!\\nThe RoughRiders have played 100 games this season. With only 40 games left, the ‘Riders currently own the Texas League’s second best record at 57-43. To celebrate the century mark, let’s tell you about 100 things from each of the 100 games. I promise that everything will not be listed, but let’s add up some of the RoughRiders’ most notable numbers and get to 100 x 100, or 10,000. Here we go.\\n0: The number of runs, hits, or base runners that Martin Perez allowed during his rain-shortened perfect game April 19 at Arkansas.\\n12: The number of home runs hit in the RoughRiders’ 19-4 victory over Corpus Christi this past Friday. The ‘Riders had eight of those, including three by Tommy Mendonca.\\n19: Frisco’s run total from that win last week, which matched a franchise-high for runs in a game. The club also surpassed its previous record in home runs (8) and hits (24).\\n20: How many times Dr Pepper Ballpark has been sold out this season. The RoughRiders currently lead the Texas League in attendance, averaging almost eight thousand people per night.\\n26: The ‘Riders have come from behind in 26 victories this season, which makes up almost half of Frisco’s wins.\\n48: How many different men have donned the RoughRiders uniform this season, which is a list that consists of men like defending American League MVP Josh Hamilton and undrafted 2011 free agent Jimmy Swift. And seemingly everyone in between.\\n65: The number of days the RoughRiders have been tied for or in sole possession of second place in the Texas League South Division.\\n76: The RoughRiders have made 76 transactions this season. The first one was sending now Chris Mobley, who is now with the Reds, to Triple-A Round Rock April 5. The most recent one was Robbie Diaz’s return to Frisco late last week.\\n100: Uh well, this is the number of games the ‘Riders have played. Sorry, I had to include it.\\n103: The number of home runs that the ‘Riders have hit this season, which is already 35 more than the club’s season total last year.\\n186: When you add the home runs and RBIs for Mike Bianucci (23, 70) and Tommy Mendonca (20, 73), you get 186. According to Michael Damman, the Director of the RoughRiders Statistical Research Department, the RoughRiders are the only team in the minors to have teammates that own 20+ homers and 70+ RBIs.\\n199: The number of wins in Frisco manager Steve Buechele’s career. He is 199-170 in his career and 120-101 during his time with the RoughRiders.\\n264: That’s how many minutes the RoughRiders’ longest game lasted. It was a 4-hour, 24-minute thriller that Arkansas won 4-3 in 15 innings.\\n296: Through Monday’s action, the Rangers’ minor league system has won 296 games, which is third-most in baseball. Texas’ farm system has the best winning percentage at .584.\\n306: Renny Osuna’s hit total while with the RoughRiders, which is second to Steve Murphy. Murphy had 319 during his time in Frisco.\\n541: The number of runs Frisco’s offense has scored this season, which is good for more than five runs per contest.\\n.570 (this is counting as 570, by the way): Frisco’s winning percentage, which would be the fourth-best in franchise history. The previous high is .607 back in 2007.\\n774: The number of strikeouts that Frisco’s pitching staff has come up with during the season. Jake Brigham leads all ‘Riders with 85.\\n910: Frisco pitching has thrown 910 innings this year. In that span, the club owns a 4.41 ERA, which is third in the Texas League.\\n965: How many hits the RoughRiders’ offense has mustered, which is almost ten per game. Frisco trails only Springfield in the Texas League in hits.\\n1.007 (this is counting as 1,007, by the way): Leonys Martin’s OPS while with the RoughRiders, which leads all 2011 ‘Riders not named Josh Hamilton (1.087), who doesn’t quite count. Martin hit .348 with four homers and 24 RBIs in 29 games at the Double-A level.\\n1509: The total number of bases the ‘Riders have reached this season. That’s a lot of running.\\n2004: The year of the RoughRiders’ first and only Texas League championship season. Here in 2011, the ‘Riders have proven through their first 100 games that they have the talent to add another title here in 2011.\\nYep, that’s 10,000. It will be fun to see what 1 or 100 amazing things the RoughRiders do in the season’s stretch run. Enjoy the ride along with us.\\nEvery Father’s Day I can’t help but think of that scene from Field of Dreams where Kevin Costner plays catch with his dad (once your done reading you can watch it here).\\nI’m not ashamed to say it makes me cry every time. I wanted to ask some of the ‘Riders what some of their favorite baseball memories were with their dads, and I’m glad I can share their answers with you.\\n“To this day, I remember my dad, and my mom, always being there and watching every game my brothers and I played.“\\nI then asked Boo about the first time his dad got to see him play in the major leagues.\\n“We were playing the Angles and I had a bunch of friends and family come out to the game. I remember hugging my dad after the game and him telling me that he had tears in his eyes during the National Anthem.”\\nLHP, Robbie Erlin: Growing up in Santa Cruz, Calif., Erlin’s father probably never imagined that his son would be the Rangers’ No. 4 prospect at just 20-years-old. But as Erlin’s coach in the Scotts Valley Little League, he greatly influenced his son’s future career.\\n“When I was 9-years-old my dad told me that before I could throw a curveball, I had to be able to locate my fastball. He and I worked after practice on throwing a curve and finally one day during a game I was pitching he signaled to our catcher to call for a curveball.”\\nAs we all know, Robbie’s curveball is now one of the best in the Rangers’ minor league system. I then asked Robbie if 9-years-old was a bit early to be throwing a curve.\\n“Not if you know how to throw it.”\\n3B, Tommy Mendonca: By now, we all know how well Tommy has been playing lately. And we all know how hard he’s been working out. Most are aware of the magical ride he went on when playing for Fresno State University in 2008 when the Bulldogs won the College World Series and Mendo was named the College World Series Most Outstanding Player as a sophomore.\\n“Both of my parents were at every game in Omaha during our playoff run. My dad was my little league coach and it was great having him and my mom watching me and supporting me when we were playing in such big games.”\\nRHP, Jake Brigham: One of seven kids (four brothers, two sisters) , Jake grew up in Florida where his dad was a barber. He had to cut a lot of hair to support all those hungry mouths and thus had one day off a week: Wednesday.\\n“Every Wednesday afternoon he’d take us seven kids to Barnett Park and we had practically enough players to field a team. I remember him pitching to us … We all got a chance to field, catch, hit, and play the outfield.”\\n“It was great having my dad coach me in Babe Ruth League. Once I turned pro, he first had a chance to watch me play in Hickory. My best memories are of him watching me in high school, though. It was great then because I always had lots of family at the games.”\\n2B, Davis Stoneburner: His real name is Ralph, which, so conveniently for today’s article, is his father’s name. After asking him a baseball memory he shared with his dad, Stoney gave me an answer in a way that only he could.\\n“The first time my dad saw me play as a professional was in Clinton, Ia. when I was playing for the LumberKings. I was a shortstop at the time and he came out to watch me play a four-game series. Bad part was I didn’t get a single hit.”\\nFortunately, he’s now riding a nine-game hitting streak. Looks like he’s recovered.\\nWe’ll have more of a tribute to Father’s Day on the pre-game show tonight. Along with Mother’s Day, it’s one of my favorite pre-game segments all season long. First pitch tonight in the series finale in Corpus Christi crosses home plate at 6:05, pre-game coverage kicks off at 5:35.\\nIf for some reason you miss the pre-game segment of all the ‘Riders wishing their dad’s a happy Father’s Day but would like to hear it, feel free to email me at email@example.com and I’ll send you the .mp3 version.\\nTalk with you tonight,\\nThe RoughRiders are about as centrally located as it comes in the Texas League. However, that doesn’t mean that the bus rides are always short. Frisco radio broadcaster Aaron Goldsmith lets you ride shotgun on the RoughRiders’ journey Wednesday night from Midland to Corpus Christi. Before you begin reading, a quick bathroom break is of course recommended.\\n9:50 p.m. Thanks to a 6:30 p.m. first pitch, I’m off the air now and can quickly wrap up my\\npost-game work and pack my radio gear to load on the bus.\\n10:14 p.m. Before every bus ride you have to fuel up – and not just with gas. After you’ve played for three hours - or in my case talked for three hours – food is a must. Here’s what was put out for us in the clubhouse in Midland. I get some BBQ chicken thighs, mac and cheese, and a few small bags of trail mix to take on the bus. All the players pay “dues” to the “clubbie” who provides the pre- and post-game spread. Since I don’t pay daily dues, I gave the clubbie $7 for my share of food (I’m that wealthy).\\n10:33 p.m. After quickly chowing down, it’s time to load up. Most of the players are already on the bus and, as you can see below, cards is a favorite way to pass the time. Hitting Coach Brant “Brownie” Brown has already put season one of Las Vegas into the DVD player on the bus for some entertainment. Brownie is a major movie buff (his favorite is the Matrix). He always brings a good selection of movies each trip.\\n10:40 p.m. Carlos, the best bus driver in the Texas League – and it’s not even close – puts the gearshift in drive and we pull away from the clubhouse and hit the road for Corpus Christi. Steve Buechele, the ‘Riders manager, is on his laptop, as is Pitching Coach Jeff Andrews. They’re both working on their post-game player reports that they usually do from the clubhouse. On get-away-days, however, they’re forced to type from the bus.\\n11:07 p.m. I’m surprised it took this long, but I finally break out my noise canceling headphones. A pricy investment, but worth every penny. Between the movie, the air conditioning, and the noise from the road, the bus is very loud – even if no one is talking. The one thing giving the noise a run for its money is the temperature. The bus tends to get incredibly cold. Even though it was 99 degrees outside when we boarded, I have a pair of grey sweat pants pulled up over my kaki shorts. (I sense a wedgie mounting an attack within the next few hours).\\n11:40 p.m. Love my iPhone. With the MLB At Bat app, I’m listening to the final innings of the Mariners vs. Angles game (the only game in progress at this hour). I’m not a fan of either team, but after calling four games solo in Midland, it’s nice to hear a voice other than my own (I’m sure others would agree).\\n1:13 a.m. My first “wakeup” of the trip. Something you get used to. On an eight hour trip I’ll probably fall in and out of consciousness at least a half dozen times. This time it’s for something somewhat rare. Carlos has pulled the bus over at a rest stop and Boo and Brownie scamper off quickly to use the restroom. The M’s/Halos game is long over. No idea who won. I wonder if people fall asleep like that when I’m broadcasting? A question I fear asking. I switch quickly to iTunes and am out again in a few minutes.\\n2:13 a.m. Strangely, exactly an hour later I’m up for no particular reason and am thrilled to see that all the cabin lights along with season one of Las Vegas has been turned off. Heaven. Sometimes the lights and movie du jour stay on until as late as 4 a.m. making it harder to sleep. I glance in front of me and see the silhouette of our Strength and Conditioning Coach, Eric McMahon. He’s wearing a ballcap, sunglasses, and headphones. Why the sunglasses when it’s dark? A veteran move. Especially for us guys who sit near the front of the bus, it helps to darken oncoming headlights, making it easier fall asleep. Unfortunately I’m officially awake. With five hours to go, it’s trail mix time.\\n3:51 a.m. Driving through downtown San Antonio. Too bad we’re playing the Hooks.\\n4:19 a.m. Finally about to fall back asleep when … wedgie.\\n5:58 a.m. Our Athletic Trainer Carlos Olivas lovingly taps my leg which is stretched across the isle. This, in the world of minor league bus rides, is a wakeup call. We’re here. He darts off the bus because someone has to be in charge of everyone’s room keys. He’s off to the front desk to check everyone in while I try to wake up.\\n6:02 a.m. As the players rush pass me to get off the bus I pack up my bag and gather my stuff. I walk off the bus to find that along with the RoughRiders, the humidity made the trip to Corpus as well.\\n6:07 a.m. I’m in my room on the 16th floor. Radio guys always get the Penthouse. Tonight is game one against the Hooks. Time to get some sleep. The bus leaves the hotel for the ballpark this afternoon 4:30.\\nWith the 447th pick in the MLB Draft, the San Francisco Giants selected Garrett Buechele, the son of Frisco manager Steve Buechele. Garrett played third base for the Oklahoma Sooners.\\nHe had been selected last year in the 18th round by the Rangers, but he did not sign. Another year in college earned Garrett a four-round increase in his stock.\\nA couple of other cool connections as the Draft continues today—Matt Skole, the brother of Texas’ first-round pick last year (Jake Skole), was the fifth-round pick (157th overall) by Washington.\\nKansas City’s 15th-round pick (456th overall), Richard Espy, is the son of Tulsa manager Duane Espy.\\nOh, and about a thousand players have been drafted out of the state of Texas. Sources tell me that number will continue to rise.\\nThe NBA Finals are set. It will be Miami against Dallas beginning Tuesday night in South Beach, just like I accurately predicted.\\nIf you were gullible enough to click that link, I apologize. Actually, I picked the Lakers over the Bulls. For what it is worth, those two teams went a combined 1-8 against the two teams that will play for basketball’s ultimate prize. As you can tell, I’m really good at predicting.\\nNot only do the Mavericks have the support of the DFW area, but they are also gaining support from all those who dislike Miami and its “Big Three.” I fall into this category, and I’m in the most passionate subset of it because I’m a Cleveland fan.\\nI’m just warning all you Mavericks fans–it isn’t a great omen to have Cleveland on your side. The city doesn’t exactly thrive in these situations. I’ll tell you this, though. If the Mavs pull it out, then Dirk and the guys will get quite an ovation in their trip to Cleveland next year.\\nLet’s go Mavs, and let’s go Facts.\\n- Before we get into a few thriving RoughRiders, there was a trade today. Right-hander Chris Mobley was sent to the Reds for a player to be named later and cash. Mobley split time between Frisco and Triple-A Round Rock and had a 4.67 earned run average in 14 outings.\\n- “This is probably one of those moves that is great for the player. There’s a Triple-A job open in Louisville,” Frisco manager Steve Buechele said about Mobley’s departure. “He’s a great kid. Hopefully, he’ll go out and help them.”\\n- He’s no Dirk Nowitzki right now, but Frisco starter Martin Perez has been on fire as of late. In his last four starts, Perez has four quality starts, 25 strikeouts, and a 0.68 ERA. Yesterday, Perez left with the lead for the fifth time this season, and he finally received his first win in those situations. His only other win (and decision, for that matter) came in that rain-shortened perfect game April 19.\\n- So far this season, it has been easy to tell whether or not Perez has it going. Perez, the Rangers’ top prospect, has given up a combined nine runs in the first and second innings and just four in the rest of the game. He owns a 1.07 ERA from the third inning on.\\n- Finally, Perez is dominating in situations that he should dominate. Against fellow left-handers, he has allowed only seven hits in 44 at-bats (.159). For what it’s worth, lefties hit .267 against Perez a year ago. Also, when Perez is ahead in the count, his opposition is hitting .113.\\n- With a top prospect, the question of a promotion pops up. “No doubt,” Buechele said when he was asked about it. “You look at the Texas League stat sheet, and he’s the number one pitcher in this league. Certainly, those thoughts start crossing your mind, and I would have no problem recommending him a promotion. I think he could handle Triple-A right now. His improvement from last year to this year has been incredible.”\\n- Buechele said that the biggest keys to Perez’s jump have been the improved command of his fastball and the ability to keep some rough innings under control. Perez has given up more than one run in an inning only three times this season.\\n- Leonys Martin continues to perform well for the ‘Riders. He has hit safely in 10 of his 13 games this year, and his average sits at .315. When you look at his game-by-game average, Martin has never had it dip below .273. He is hitting better against lefties (.320) than he has against righties (.310).\\n- What has been most impressive to me when looking at his stats is his performance in “clutch” situations. He is swinging at a .583 clip (7-for-12) with men in scoring position. Within that figure, he is 4-for-5 with runners in scoring position and two down. Overall, when men are on base, Martin has a .421 average.\\n- On the flip side, it has been a rough period for Engel Beltre. Since returning from his 15-game suspension, Beltre is hitting .154. He has yet to drive in a run or steal a base during these nine games. He has struck out eight times and walked only once.\\n- In these nine games, Beltre has played in right field four times, left field three times and center field twice. Martin has only played outside of center field once as a RoughRider.\\n- Finally, here’s a pretty cool new blog from Neil Wagner, a pitcher for the Midland RockHounds. He had a funny blog about his time in Frisco during Josh Hamilton and Nelson Cruz’s rehab stint. I hope he continues to update it.\\nJoin us for the pre-game show at 6:35 along the RBN. First pitch is set for 7:05.',\n",

       " {'text': \"Past Exhibition: The Arnhold Collection\\nThe Arnhold Collection of Meissen Porcelain, 1710–50\\nThe Frick Collection exhibited a selection of Meissen porcelain from the collection of Henry Arnhold. One of the greatest private holdings of early Meissen assembled in the twentieth century, the collection was formed in two phases, the first in Dresden between 1926 and 1935 by Henry's parents, Lisa (née Mattersdorff; 1890–1972) and Heinrich (1885–1935) Arnhold; the second, by Henry in New York between 1972 and 2006. Heinrich Arnhold, trained as a lawyer and a member of a powerful banking family in Dresden, and his wife, who had studied medicine, were married in 1914 and became deeply involved in the cultural and intellectual life of the city. Their interest in collecting porcelain may have stemmed, in part, from the fact that Heinrich served on the boards of thirteen porcelain and ceramic firms in Saxony with which his bank was affiliated. He and Lisa began by making a few tentative purchases of porcelain, which were later sold, before deciding to focus on the acquisition of pieces from the early period at Meissen, choosing, almost exclusively, wares and vases rather than figures. The collection grew to include large vases, pieces from table services, as well as tea, coffee, and chocolate services. Although well known to specialists, this remarkable collection has never before been the subject of a major public exhibition.\\nThe formula and method for manufacturing true porcelain were developed in China by the sixth century but remained a consuming mystery in the West until their discovery in 1709 by the alchemist Johann Friedrich Böttger (1682–1719), under the patronage of August II, elector of Saxony and king of Poland. The following year, the king established a royal manufactory outside of Dresden in the town of Meissen, and the porcelain created there has been known by that name ever since.\\nThe early years at Meissen were exciting times of experiment, not only with the formula for porcelain but also with shapes and decoration. Initially, many of the works produced were direct imitations of Japanese and Chinese objects in Augustus II's famous collection. Others had European forms incorporating Asian decorative motifs. Because the manufactory initially had difficulty with firing enamel colors, most of the wares were white or were painted or gilded after firing.\\nIn many ways, Henry Arnhold, in adding to the collection of his parents, continued to follow their taste and preferences. He took a new direction, however, in acquiring significant blue-and-white objects commissioned by Augustus II that bore the mark of his famed Japanese Palace, just as he did in acquiring fifteen cabinet and dessert figures in 2006. The result is a rich and profoundly personal collection of exquisite objects from the early, innovative period at Meissen.\\nThe Arnhold Collection of Meissen Porcelain, 1710–50, was organized for The Frick Collection by Director Anne L. Poulet and Maureen Cassidy-Geiger, guest curator of the exhibition. It was accompanied by a fully illustrated catalogue, published by The Frick Collection in association with D. Giles Unlimited, London.\\nThe exhibition was made possible, in part, by the generous support of the Arnhold Foundation.\",\n",

UNHCR is not responsible for, nor does it necessarily endorse, its content. Any views expressed are solely those of the author or publisher and do not necessarily reflect those of UNHCR, the United Nations or its Member States.|\\nIsraeli authorities are threatening detained Eritrean and Sudanese nationals, including asylum seekers, with prolonged detention to pressure them to leave Israel, Human Rights Watch and the Hotline for Migrant Workers said today. Since December 11, 2012, Israel\\'s pressure has convinced several hundred detained Sudanese and one Eritrean to leave Israel, and in February 2013, some 50 detained Eritreans agreed under similar pressure to leave for Uganda. All 50 remain in Israeli detention.\\nSudanese and Eritreans face a real risk of harm if they return to their home countries. Under Sudanese law, anyone who has visited Israel faces up to 10 years in prison in Sudanand Sudanese officials have said the courts will apply the law. Because of credible persecution fears relating to punishment for evading indefinite military service in Eritrea, 80 percent of Eritrean asylum seekers worldwide are granted some form of protection. For years, Israel has refused to process Eritrean and Sudanese asylum claims, although at the end of February it began to register at least some detainees\\' claims.\\n\"Israel\\'s prolonged detention of asylum seekers apparently aims to shatter all hope so they feel they have no real choice but to leave the country,\" said Gerry Simpson, senior refugee researcher at Human Rights Watch. \"Instead of browbeating some of the world\\'s most abused and vulnerable people into giving up their rights and putting themselves at grave risk, Israel should release asylum seekers while their claims are examined and protect anyone found to risk serious harm if returned.\"\\nHuman Rights Watch and Hotline for Migrant Workers (HMW), an Israeli nongovernmental organization,said that if Israel returned anyone to a place where the person\\'s life or freedom would be threatened, such return would violate international law\\'s prohibition on refoulement – forced return to a serious risk of persecution.\\nThe groups said Israel would also be violating the refoulement prohibition if a person \"chose\" return after Israeli authorities had threatened prolonged or indefinite detention as the only alternative. The 1951 Refugee Convention bars the return \"in any manner whatsoever\" to places where a person would face a serious risk of persecution.\\nRefoulement can also occur as a result of a chain deportation, in which refugees or asylum seekers are sent to third countries that predictably will not respect their rights as asylum seekers but instead send them back to places of persecution.\\nThe United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) has confirmed that Sudanese agreeing to leave Israel in recent months were sent to third countries through which they only transited and traveled on to Sudan. Human Rights Watch and HMW said those countries had no obligation to allow Sudanese nationals to enter, which means they would have been forced to travel onward to Sudan.\\nIn early March, HMW spoke with the only Eritrean to have \"agreed\" under pressure to go to Uganda who says he was refused entry there and deported to Cairo for onward deportation to Eritrea. The only alternative the Egyptian authorities gave him was to return to Israel to once again face indefinite detention, which he rejected. On March 6, he flew to Eritrea.\\nPressuring Sudanese and Eritreans to leave Israel for third countries that have no obligation to allow them to leave airport transit zones risks indirectly forcing them back to their own countries, Human Rights Watch and HMW said.\\nIsrael is holding more than 2,000 African nationals in two detention centers near the Egyptian border. This includes at least 1,100 Eritreans and 600 Sudanese, all of whom have little prospect of being released because of restrictive Israeli asylum laws and policies. Hundreds of the Eritreans only reached Israel after surviving kidnapping in Sudan and Egypt, and tortureby criminal gangs in Egypt\\'s Sinai desert.\\nAbout 50,000 other Eritrean and Sudanese nationals live in Israel\\'s cities. Israel has informally suspended their deportation, but senior officials have repeatedly threatened to deport them without officially clarifying whether they would first be allowed to claim asylum. In early March, the Israeli media reported that the Interior Minister said he planned to detain all \"infiltrators\" – which Israeli lawdefines as anyone who irregularly enters Israeland which includes the 50,000 – and to deport them to a still-to-be-identified third country.\\nOn March 3, HMW spoke by phone with an Eritrean man in Cairo who said he agreed to fly on February 28 from Israel to Uganda after Israeli officials refused to register his asylum claim and threatened to detain him for three years. He said the Ugandan authorities refused him entry and deported him to Cairo, where the authorities also refused him entry but said he could fly back to Israel where he faced further prolonged detention. After two days without sleep, the man refused and flew to Eritrea on March 6.\\nOn March 4, Israel\\'s attorney general called on the Interior Ministry not to send any Eritrean citizen \"to any destination outside Israel\\'s borders\" until a range of legal issues had been clarified. In early March, UNHCR also reported that in mid-February, the authorities had begun handing out larger numbers of asylum application forms to detainees.\\nHuman Rights Watch and HMW said that the attorney general\\'s statement was a positive move, but that the Interior Ministry should not remove any Sudanese nationals either, should allow all detainees wishing to claim asylum to do so, should release them while their claims are examined, and should end all threats of prolonged detention.\\nThe majority of those currently in detention entered Israel in or after June 2012 and were detained on arrival under Israel\\'s recently amended \"Prevention of Infiltration\" law, also known as the \"Anti-Infiltration\" law, which allows the authorities to detain anyone irregularly entering Israel. Israeli authorities have also used a September 2012 regulationto arrest and detain about 250 people, most of them Eritrean and Sudanese nationals who have been living in Israel for several years.\\nThe 2012 regulation allows the authorities to detain and deport any \"infiltrator\" who is suspected of – but not necessarily charged with or convicted of – offenses \"endangering national security or the public peace.\" UNHCR officials in Israel and Israeli groups working with refugees say that many people detained under the regulation were suspected of only modest offenses, such as minor assault charges or possession of stolen goods such as mobile phones.\\nHMW has interviewed almost 1,000 Eritrean and Sudanese detainees in recent months and has documented the departure of hundreds of detained Sudanese nationals since December 11 after the authorities refused to register their asylum claims and threatened to detain them for three years or indefinitely.\\n\"When I asked for asylum, the Ministry of Interior staff said,\\'Israel doesn\\'t want black people here,\\'\"a detained Sudanese man told HMW staff on December 19.\"He told me I should go back to my country and that anyone who did not agree to leave would stay in prison for three years. I know many people who were told the same and who went back to Sudan.\"\\nIn January and February, HMW interviewed dozens of Eritrean detainees, some of whom have been detained for almost a year, who also said Israeli officials refused to register their asylum claims and told them that they had to choose between years in detention or removal to Uganda or Eritrea. HMW said that in the first two weeks of February, around 50 Eritreans signed documents \"agreeing\" under this pressure to be removed to Uganda.\\n\"It doesn\\'t matter how you dress this up, Israel is pushing people into a corner and giving them the repugnant choice of years of hardship in detention or removal from Israel,\" said Sigal Rozen, public policy coordinator with HMW. \"Those agreeing to leave say it was no choice at all. All they want is to get out of detention.\"\\nOn February 25, UNHCR in Tel Aviv criticized Israel\\'s pressure on detained Eritreans, saying that \"agreement to return to Eritrea under a jail ultimatum cannot be considered voluntary by any criterion.\"\\nOn February 18, Interior Minister Eli Yishai told the Knesset that Israel had no formal agreement with Uganda or any other country governing transfer of Eritreans, although he added that Israel would continue \"with the utmost decisiveness\" to ensure that Eritrean and Sudanese nationals would \"voluntarily or involuntarily\" leave Israel.\\nUNHCR says it has received reports that the Israeli authorities have filmed detainees threatened with prolonged or indefinite detention who were asking to sign a statement saying they came to Israel to work and that they wanted to return to Eritrea or go to another country.\\nA Sudanese detainee told HMW in December that he had seen Interior Ministry staff filming people, \"asking them to say they wanted to go back to Sudan\" and that when the person being filmed said the wrong thing, the staff members said: \"Don\\'t say that! Just say that you are from this and that country and that you want to go back.\"\\nUNHCR also said Israel\\'s failure until late February to register any detainees\\' asylum claims, and the resulting prospect of prolonged or indefinite detention, meant detainees faced significant pressure to agree to leave Israel. In its February 25 statement, the refugee agency said detainees \"don\\'t receive full access to the refugee apparatus, and when there\\'s no access ... lead[ing] to release, then there is no voluntary return.\"\\nUNHCR Detention Guidelines say asylum seekers should be detained only \"as a last resort\" as a strictly necessary and proportionate measure to achieve a legitimate legal purpose and that countries should not detain asylum seekers simply for the purpose of deportation. Detention is permitted only briefly to establish a person\\'s identity or for longer periods if it is the only way to achieve broader aims such as protecting national security or public health.\\nIsrael does not have formal transfer or readmission agreements with any African country. UNHCR\\'s Executive Committee says that states should expeditiously return people not needing international protection to \"their countries of origin, other countries of nationality or countries with an obligation to receive them back,\" but does not list as an appropriate option returns or transfers to countries that have no connections or obligations whatsoever toward the person being returned.\\nHuman Rights Watch and HMW said that sending Eritreans to Uganda and Sudanese nationals to other countries where they had never been before clearly did not meet UNHCR\\'s criteria.\\n\"Sudanese and Eritrean nationals returning to their home countries from Israel risk persecution,\" Simpson said. \"Without formal agreements monitored by UNHCR, the Israeli authorities should not be transferring them to other countries either, let alone pressuring them to forego claiming asylum and to leave Israel.\"\\nFor details about Israel\\'s restrictive asylum policies toward Eritrean and Sudanese nationals and extracts of HMW\\'s interviews with detainees, please see below.\\nFor Human Rights Watch\\'s October 2012 joint news release with Israeli organizations on Israel\\'s pushbacks of asylum seekers at its border with Egypt, please visit:\\nFor Human Rights Watch\\'s June 2012 news release calling on Israel to amend the newly revised Anti-Infiltration law that punishes asylum seekers for irregularly crossing into Israel, please visit:\\nFor Human Rights Watch\\'s September 2012 reporting on torture of Eritreans in Egypt\\'s Sinai peninsula, please visit:\\nFor more Human Rights Watch reporting on Israel, please visit:\\nAuthorities Thwart Detainees\\' Attempts to Claim Asylum to Coerce Agreement to Leave Israel\\nIsrael purposefully uses several measures to pressure detained Eritrean and Sudanese nationals to agree to leave Israel, Human Rights Watch and HWM said. These are the threat of long-term detention, limited or no access to Israel\\'s nascent asylum system, and approval of refugee claims at such extremely low rates that there are only very slim chances of being released from detention as a recognized refugee.\\nIsrael has detained most of the 2,000 people currently in detention centers for about six months, and in some cases for more than a year, UNHCR said. UNHCR\\'s 2012 Detention Guidelines say that countries should only detain asylum seekers as a measure of last resort, \"with liberty being the default position.\"\\nHMW and other Israeli refugee groups have reported many times on the Israeli authorities\\' failure to give detainees the opportunity to lodge asylum claims. Detainees told HMW that if Israel had allowed them to claim asylum when they were first detained and had released them while reviewing their claims, they would not have agreed to leave Israel.\\nUNHCR and Israeli refugee organizations say that over the past nine months, hundreds of detainees have struggled to lodge asylum claims because of insufficient information on how to submit claims, some officials\\' refusals to distribute asylum application forms or lengthy delays in receiving forms.\\nBetween September and the end of January, HMW staff working with interpreters conducted 137 prison visits and 963 detailed interviews with detainees.\\nHundreds of detainees told HMW that when they asked how to claim asylum, officials – including prison guards, detention tribunal judges, and Tigrinya interpreters – told them they would be detained for at least three years or indefinitely if they lodged asylum claims.\\nDozens told HMW that the prospect of prolonged detention and a lack of access to asylum meant they had little choice but to sign forms agreeing to their removal.\\nSome said officials simply denied they had a right to claim asylum. A detained Sudanese man told HMW on February 12:\\n\"In the first interview I told [the officials] that I want to ask for asylum. When I said that, the interrogator banged his fist on the table and said that in Israel there is no asylum and that we come just to work and should go back [to Sudan].\"\\nSome said officials refused to respond to their asylum requests and simply threatened long-term detention.One of the Sudanese detainees HMW interviewed on February 12 said:\\n\"After HMW helped me to ask for asylum, the Ministry of Interior staff asked me three times whether I was ready to return to Sudan. I said no. They put pressure on me, saying that if something happened to my wife and children in Sudan it would be my fault. They said if I stayed, I would spend many years in prison. Some said three years, others said five, and then they said eight or ten years.\"\\nOther detainees said they had no access to asylum application forms. An Eritrean man who has been detained for 10 months at the Saharonim detention center told HMW on February 14:\\nI did not fill out an asylum request form because I didn\\'t have access to a form, so HMW tried to claim asylum for me. The judge said I would stay here [in detention] for three years. The bullet wound [from being shot in Sinai] means I use crutches. I have been here for a long time. The conditions here are hard for me, physically and emotionally. Because of the pain and my emotional state I agreed to leave for Uganda. If you tell me you will release me from prison [in Israel], I won\\'t go to Uganda and I will wait.\\nIn another case, detainees told HMW that after repeated requests, guards put 12 asylum application forms in a room and that so many detainees tried to grab them, the forms were torn apart in the rush.\\nMany said the prospect of prolonged detention meant that they felt forced to agree to leave Israel.\\nAn Eritrean man detained for eight months in the Saharonim detention center, who has also unsuccessfully tried to claim asylum in detention, also told HMW on February 14:\\n\"It is very hard to live here. Many people are in bad emotional states, and this is very stressful for all of us. That is the reason that people are choosing to go to Uganda. It\\'s hard to bear the thought that we\\'ll be in here for three more years.\"\\nOther detainees simply referred to the overall confusion about asylum procedures and how long they might be detained.\\nAn Eritrean man detained for eight months in the Saharonim detention center told HMW on February 14:\\n\"Everything we are told in prison is very confusing. One person says we can file an asylum request and that we will get a response in three months, another says we will be here for three years, another says we can only go to Uganda.\"\\nHuman Rights Watch and HMW said that on February 17 at least 34 Eritrean detainees in Saharonim detention center demonstrated against what they said was the authorities\\' refusal to allow them to claim asylum. They were transferred to the Ktisot detention center, where they were made to live in tents as punishment.\\nBased on interviews with hundreds of detainees, UNHCR and HMW said that as a result of Israeli authorities\\' obfuscation of procedures and prolonged detention threats, hundreds of would-be asylum seekers detained since June 2012 have been unable to claim asylum.\\nUNHCR says Israel only started distributing a significant number of asylum application forms to some detainees in mid-February and that before February, very few forms were distributed.\\nOn February 26, the Israeli authorities informed UNHCR in writing that there were no plans to deport Eritreans to Uganda or Eritrea. Human Rights Watch and HMW said Israel had not been accused of deporting Eritreans to Uganda or Eritrea and that the authorities\\' statement did not address the fact that Eritrean detainees had been told to sign \"voluntary\" removal papers or remain in detention for years.\\nHMW and UN Refugee Agency Attempts to Help Detainees Claim Asylum\\nBetween September 2012 and mid-February 2013, HMW attempted to file 320 asylum claims with the Interior Ministry on behalf of detainees who said they had repeatedly asked detention center staff to give them asylum application forms, but that staff told them they had no forms.\\nIsrael\\'s 2011 asylum regulations do not specify the format in which an asylum claim should be lodged. HMW said it has repeatedly written to the Interior Ministry and immigration authorities to ask for copies of official asylum registration forms. When replying, the ministry ignored the request and simply said detainees were told how to claim asylum.\\nSince early January, the ministry has informed HMW that all its submissions were invalid because asylum claims had to be completed on official forms.\\nHMW staff visiting detention centers said detention officials started distributing a new standard six-page asylum registration form in English on February 12, the day on which HMW issued a news releasecondemning Israel\\'s pressure on Eritrean detainees to agree to removal to Uganda or Eritrea.\\nHuman Rights Watch and HMW said Israel has ignored its own asylum regulations, which say that \"information sheets regarding the manner of submitting an [asylum] application … the procedure for handling … applications, the duties of the applicant, the right of the asylum seeker to contact a legal representative of his choosing and the scope of representation to which he is entitled during the process, will be available in places of custody...\"\\nIn October, immigration authorities told HMW they had posted notices in all parts of the detention centers explaining how to claim asylum. HMW said it had not seen any such notices during its 137 visits between September and January, and UNHCR said that the authorities had not provided that information in the detention centers.\\nIn December, UNHCR submitted a draft document to the Interior Ministry that explained in simple terms how detainees can lodge asylum claims. UNHCR said that in late February, the authorities posted unclear notices in detention centers on how to lodge claims.\\nIn early March, Israel\\'s Interior Ministry told UNHCR it had registered 800 asylum claims at the Saharonim detention center, up from 50 in December and 400 in January.\\nUNHCR said it has no evidence that the Interior Ministry is conducting adequate asylum reviews in detention and has asked to observe asylum interviews with detainees. Since 2011, the Interior Ministry has refused these requests for all but two interviews.\\nOther Pressure on Eritreans\\nDetained Eritreans told HMW in February that 23 of them who agreed to be removed to Uganda were taken on February 11 to the Eritrean Embassy in Tel Aviv to help arrange travel documentation.\\nHMW and UNHCR, who between them interviewed all 23 of the group, say that only six met with an embassy official, possibly the ambassador, but that the rest refused to meet with anyone, either because they had not known they would be taken to the embassy or because the first six were told the embassy could only help them travel to Eritrea. All 23 remain in detention.\\nAn Eritrean man detained in the Saharonim detention center for a year told HMW on February 14 that he had decided to go to Uganda rather than remain in detention any longer:\\n\"The extended stay in prison has made me hopeless. So last Monday [February 11] they took us to meet the Eritrean ambassador in Tel Aviv, but he said he could only help us go to Eritrea, not Uganda. We told him we did not want to go to Eritrea and then he asked us why we were claiming asylum in Israel.\"\\nTwo men taken to the Eritrean embassy on February 11 told HMW that an Eritrean official had \"asked for and written down names and phone numbers of their relatives and family in Eritrea.\" Human Rights Watch and HMW said that putting Eritrean nationals who had been denied access to Israel\\'s asylum system in contact with Eritrean officials put their lives and the lives of their relatives in Eritrea at risk. The Eritrean government treats asylum claims by Eritreans as treasonous acts.\\nRuled by an extremely repressive government, Eritrea requires all but a few of its citizens under 50 to serve in the military indefinitely. Anyone of draft age leaving the country without permission is branded a draft evader or deserter, risking years in prison, often in inhumane conditions, as well as forced labor and torture. UNHCR\\'s 2011 guidelines on Eritrean asylum seekers consider that, in practice, the punishment for desertion or evasion is so severe and disproportionate that it constitutes persecution.\\nUNHCR says that over 80 percent of Eritrean asylum seekers worldwide are granted some form of protection.\\nIsrael has granted about 37,000 Eritreans living in Israel\\'s cities a minimal form of what UNHCR calls \"temporary protection,\" which amounts to a right not to be deported to their home countries but nothing else. They are given \"conditional release permits,\" referring to a release from what would otherwise be deportation.\\nIsrael told UNHCR in November 2012 that all permit holders could apply for asylum, but UNHCR says the authorities have not published any statements or information on this policy and that very few permit holders are aware they can apply. UNHCR says that it has not seen any documentation proving Israeli authorities are reviewing any claims Eritrean and Sudanese permit holders may have lodged.\\nIsrael\\'s Lack of Transfer Agreements With Third Countries\\nIsrael does not have formal transfer or readmission agreements with any African countries.\\nUNHCR\\'s Executive Committee Conclusion 96 of 2003 calls for efficient and expeditious return of people found not to need international protection to \"their countries of origin, other countries of nationality or countries with an obligation to receive them back.\"\\nIt does not list as an appropriate option transferring a rejected asylum seeker – or a person blocked from claiming asylum – to countries that have no ties with, or obligations toward, the person and where there is not even a bilateral agreement governing such a transfer. Human Rights Watch and HMW said sending Eritreans to Uganda clearly did not meet UNHCR\\'s criteria.\\nFormal agreements on readmission of third country nationals – which involve returning them to countries they have passed through en route to the country that is sending them back –normally include provisions committing the sending country not to return people at risk of persecution to their home countries.\\nHuman Rights Watch and HMW said that transfer agreements – to countries where the person has never been before – should have identical provisions. Absent such an agreement, Israel\\'s transfer of Eritrean and Sudanese nationals to countries like Uganda provides no guarantee of admission to the third country and no assurance that those countries would not immediately return them to home countries where they would risk persecution.\\nUNHCR said it has not been actively involved in any discussions about facilitating voluntary repatriation, or travel to third countries, of Sudanese or Eritrean detainees from Israel. That is because UNHCR does not consider return from detention to be voluntary unless detainees have had full access to a fair, efficient, and transparent asylum system.\\nRisk of Indefinite Detention of Sudanese and Need to Recognize Them Automatically as Refugees\\nHuman Rights Watch and HMW also said that Israel\\'s inability to deport 600 detained Sudanese to Sudan because of the extremely high risk of persecution there means they face indefinite detention in Israel, unlawful under international law.\\nAs it does with Eritreans, Israel has granted about 14,000 Sudanese nationals living in various parts of Israel informal temporary protection and has not registered any of them as asylum seekers.\\nThe two organizations said Israel\\'s coercion of detained Sudanese to return to Sudan meant the temporary protection status for the 14,000 currently not in detention – but who risk detention at any moment – was not enough to protect them against the risk of refoulement.\\nThe 600 detainees, and 14,000 other Sudanese nationals in Israel, should be automatically granted refugee status. Section 52 of Sudan\\'s Penal Code says that Sudanese nationals who visit an enemy state will be sentenced to 10 years in prison. Sudanese officials have repeatedly referred to Israel as an enemy state and have threatened to apply the law.\\nIn 2007, the Sudanese Foreign Ministry said that visiting Israel was a crime and the Sudanese Refugees Commissioner claimed that Sudanese refugees in Israel wanted to \"implement Zionism agendas against Sudan,\" and called on Egyptian authorities to \"firmly penalize any Sudanese refugees if they were found trying to infiltrate through Egypt into Israel.\"\\nSudanese nationals in Israel therefore have a sur place refugee claim, in which the well-founded fear of being persecuted arises as a consequence of events that happened after the person left his or her country of origin.\\n50,000 Eritreans, Sudanese Risk Detention, Pressure to Leave Israel\\nSince 2006, around 37,000 Eritrean and 14,000 Sudanese nationals entered Israel through Egypt\\'s Sinai region. The numbers of new arrivals prompted Israel to build a recently completed fence that runs the full 240 kilometers of Israel\\'s border with Egypt, which now makes it extremely difficult for anyone to enter Israel irregularly from Egypt.\\nAccording to the Israeli authorities, in December only 40 people entered the country from Egypt, down from 1,500 a month for most of 2012. UNHCR says fewer than 20 entered from Egypt across the land border in January. In October 2012, Human Rights Watch reportedon Israel\\'s pushbacks at the border fence and called on Israel not to reject and push asylum seekers back or deport them without first reviewing their refugee claims.\\nUNHCR says most of the approximately 50,000 Eritrean and Sudanese nationals in Israel live in Tel Aviv. They are free to move within Israel and can work informally, thanks to a January 2011 Supreme Court ruling which says that the police and other authorities may not take legal action against employers who hire people holding the permits. If the authorities want to take such legal action, they must inform the court 30 days in advance.\\nUNHCR, HMW, and other Israeli refugee groups say that Israeli officials have repeatedly criticized \"work infiltrators\" and threatened to fine employers, and have not publicized information about the Eritrean and Sudanese national\\'s work rights.\\nIsraeli refugee groups say they are concerned Israel will soon use the Prevention of Infiltration Law and the September 2012 regulation to detain tens of thousands Eritrean and Sudanese nationals currently living in Israel in four newly expanded detention centers with a capacity of 16,000 people, and then to deport them.\\nIsraeli government officials, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Interior Minister Yishai, have repeatedly threatened to deport all Sudanese and Eritrean nationals in Israel either to their home countries or to third countries. In early March, Israeli media reported the Interior Minister\\'s most recent threats.\\nHMW said that in late February, Israel\\'s Population and Immigration Authority posted a noticein the Saharonim and Ktsiot detention centers saying, among other things, that the government could use the Anti-Infiltration law to detain anyone who \"infiltrated\" – irregularly entered – Israel at any time. This would apply to the vast majority, if not all, Eritrean and Sudanese nationals who entered Israel over the past seven years or so. The notice said that \"a warrant will be issued against these infiltrators and they will be transferred to a detention facility.\"\\nIsrael\\'s \"Prevention of Infiltration Law\" and the September 2012 \"Regulation for the Treatment of InfiltratorsInvolved in Criminal Proceedings\"\\n2012 Amendments to Israel\\'s 1954 \"Prevention of Infiltration\" law\\nHuman Rights Watch and HMW said all Eritrean and Sudanese detainees face prolonged or even indefinite detention because of changes to detention powers in Israel\\'s 1954 \"Prevention of Infiltration\" law that came into effect in June 2012.\\nThe amendments give border guards and judges the power to detain indefinitely anyone who has irregularly entered Israel – that is, without passing through an official border post – and who is not a \"resident,\" as defined by Israel\\'s Population Authority Law. The law refers to all such people as \"infiltrators.\"\\nThese legal provisions violate international refugee law by not distinguishing asylum seekers from others who enter irregularly, in effect punishing asylum seekers for their irregular entry.\\nIn addition, UNHCR\\'s 2012 Detention Guidelines say that \"detention of asylum seekers should be a measure of last resort, with liberty being the default position.\"\\nThey also say that countries should not detain asylum seekers simply for the purpose of deportation: \"It is unlawful to detain asylum-seekers in on-going asylum proceedings on grounds of expulsion as they are not available for removal until a final decision on their claim has been made …[D]etention for the purposes of expulsion can only occur after the asylum claim has been finally determined and rejected.\"\\nYet the Explanatory Note accompanying the 2012 amendments to the Israeli law say the amendments aim \"primarily to allow for the detention of infiltrators for a much longer period of time … and to add … the necessary mechanisms … for holding infiltrators in detention until their deportation.\"\\nUNHCR\\'s guidelines also say that deterring others from seeking asylum, or dissuading those who have already lodged their claims from pursuing them, is not a legitimate purpose to justify detention.\\nBut the Explanatory Note to the 2012 amendments says that \"the expectation is that the length of … detention will curb the infiltration phenomenon… a phenomenon which has to be prevented … in order to protect … the state\\'s sovereignty.\"\\nIsrael\\'s Anti-Infiltration law says that the head of the Border Control Authority and Detention Review Tribunals may – but are not obliged to – release an \"infiltrator\" with a guarantee if a person has requested a residency permit, which includes asylum claims, and the \"handling\" of the request has not begun three months after the request was made, or if there has been \"no decision\" on the request nine months after the request was submitted, or if the \"infiltrator\" has been detained for three years.\\nThe new provisions replace parts of Israel\\'s 1952 Law of Entry into Israel, under which people irregularly entering Israel should be deported within 60 days or released, although in practice detainees have been held for much longer because authorities say the law gives them discretion, not an obligation, to release after 60 days.\\nThe law says that the head of the Border Control Authority and Detention Review Tribunals may refuse to release \"infiltrators\" after three or nine months, or after three years, if, among other things, they have delayed their deportation because of a lack of cooperation and if their release \"would endanger national security, public order or public health.\"\\nThe Anti-Infiltration law also says that the head of the Border Control Authority and Detention Review Tribunals may – but are not obliged – to release \"in exceptional circumstances\" an \"infiltrator\" if due to \"age or physical condition\" detention is \"likely to harm his or her health and there is no other way to prevent the harm,\" or if there are \"other special humanitarian grounds.\"\\nSeptember 2012 Regulation \"for the Treatment of Infiltrators Involved in Criminal Proceedings\"\\nA September 24, 2012 regulation \"for the Treatment of Infiltrators Involved in Criminal Proceedings\" allows Israeli authorities to detain and deport any \"infiltrator\" who is suspected of – but not necessarily charged with – criminal offenses defined in the 1954 law as offenses \"endangering national security or the public peace,\" or who has been convicted of such offenses and who has served a prison sentence. The 1954 law does not give more details on what constitutes such offenses.\\nUNHCR and Israeli nongovernmental organizations say that some of the people detained under the September regulation were suspected or convicted of only minor offenses, such as minor assault charges, possession of stolen goods such as bicycles or mobile phones or falsification of documents such as work visas, making their detention illegal under Israeli law.\\nHMW says that in a few cases its lawyers have successfully challenged decisions to detain Eritrean and Sudanese nationals under the September regulation.\\nHuman Rights Watch and HMW said that they were aware of only three cases in which the head of the Border Control Authority or Detention Review Tribunal judges have used their discretion to release a detainee under the amended 1954 law. Although all detainees have the right to appeal a Detention Tribunal\\'s decision not to release them to the Administrative Affairs Court, very few detainees can afford to pay a lawyer to represent them, which means in effect they have no right toappealtribunal decisions.',\n",

       " {'text': 'Snowflakes are a seasonal craft around here. Using my aforementioned Snowflake Seeds, my little family makes a variety of snowflakes to decorate our windows. This year, I tried something a little different… a steampunk snowflake:\\nI wasn’t sure that it would work… and I could do a lot more detail with a laser cutter… but for an experiment, I’m pretty happy with how it turned out. I’m obviously cheating on the spans, and I’ll make one with better meshing teeth later. It really should get the brass and grunge treatment, but the shape is what’s important for this initial test. I’d really love to make one with working gears via Shapeways… maybe once I can carve out a bit more time.\\nEdited to add: Now, with more sense! This version of the Gearflake has one more gear at the center, and the shape is entirely gears, no support struts like the first one. Way too much fun to make these, I tell you. The great part is that they don’t need any weird laser cutting tools, you can do these just with paper and scissors. All the cuts come in from the sides of the snowflake seed. (I’ve got a picture around here somewhere of the folded/cut versions of these…) Sure, the gears aren’t machine precise, and there are errors thanks to the paper folding thickness… but still, these are great to see take shape.\\nThis is the pattern to make the Gearflake 2.0. Once you have the snowflake seed wedge, you take this pattern (maybe fudging the teeth if you want it a little more precise) and cut out the dark parts. Leave the blue-grey parts.\\nThanks for stopping by, especially if you’re here from epbot.com. Many thanks for the link!\\n…aaand here’s version 3.0. Each iteration comes with another layer of gears. I’m running into cutting resolution issues and slight warping (though that can be cleaned up with iteration), so I’m not sure if I can go a layer deeper. I guess we’ll find out. The basics are simple enough, alternating sides for each successive gear arc when plotting them out on the ‘seed, as you might note on the 2.0 pattern. I’m sure I could use Illustrator or even Photoshop to nail down some more precise gearwork… these have been just arcs I’m guesstimating by hand.\\nThis is probably way more fun than it should be. It’s just papercutting after all… but it’s also math, art and a little bit of whimsy. I love playing in that space. It’s a somewhat eclectic Venn intersection, but it’s satisfying to see things come together. Left brain-right brain combinations and all that.',\n",

       " {'text': 'In a bid to expand its breadth and adapt to changing consumer habits, the Avis car rental company announced a deal Monday to purchase car-sharing business Zipcar for about $500 million.\\nZipcar Inc. has been growing as more people in urban areas forgo owning a car and instead tap car-sharing and hourly rental services when they need a vehicle. The company’s third-quarter sales grew 15% to $78.2 million while its membership (renters) grew 18% to more than 767,000. Zipcar earned $4.3 million in the three-month period and has said it expected 2012 to be the first full year for which it posts a profit.\\n\"We see car sharing as highly complementary to traditional car rental, with rapid growth potential and representing a scalable opportunity for us as a combined company,” said Ronald L. Nelson, chief executive of Avis Budget Group. “We expect to apply Avis Budget\\'s experience and efficiencies of fleet management with Zipcar\\'s proven, customer-friendly technology to accelerate the growth of the Zipcar brand and to provide more options for Zipsters in more places.”\\nAvis Budget, the nation’s third-largest car rental company -- after Enterprise Holdings and Hertz -- will pay $12.25 a share in cash for Zipcar, a 49% premium over the stock\\'s closing price Monday.\\nThe deal is subject to approval by Zipcar shareholders and other customary closing conditions, but owners of 32% of Zipcar’s stock have already agreed to the transaction. It is scheduled to be completed in the spring.\\n“We believe this combination is a win across the board for our members, shareholders and employees,” said Zipcar CEO Scott Griffith. “We will be well positioned to accelerate enhancements to the Zipcar member experience with more offers and additional services as well as an expanded network of locations.\"\\nAvis believes it can whittle $50 million to $70 million of expenses out of the combined operations of the companies by eliminating duplication of functions such as the cost of maintaining Zipcar as a publicly traded company.\\n\"Avis Budget\\'s existing infrastructure, scale and experience with managing multiple brands make us uniquely positioned to accelerate the growth and profitability of Zipcar,\" said Nelson.\\nGriffith will continue to run Zipcar’s day-to-day operations. The car-sharing business operates in 20 major metropolitan areas in the United States, Canada and Europe and has cars at 300 college and university campuses.',\n",

It was entertaining and informative, but I already knew most of the information in the film, so it was a bit of a let down. From there, we were taken to a spot above the factory where we could view the ice-cream being made. Unfortunately, we were packed so tightly into the space that unless you were one of the lucky few who got the spots by the windows, you couldn\\'t really see what was happening in the factory. To compensate for this, they do have two televisions that show the machinery being described, but it\\'s not really the same thing—I\\'m in the factory, I want to see the factory, not a pre-made film.\\nWe moved from this room to the final part of the tour—the free ice-cream. It\\'s a nice sized sample, and of course it\\'s quality, but by this point I just kept thinking to myself \"this is it? this is the whole tour?\" In the end, I wished I could have my $3 back so I could buy a cone of ice-cream which would have been far more enjoyable.\\nThere was one good thing about the tour, though. You\\'re free to pretty much roam about the area as you like. We walked over to the flavor graveyard, where there are tombstones set up to honor retired flavors. This was a fun trip down memory lane that we were able to do at our own pace. The land is beautiful, and there is a small playground set up for the kids. My advice to those who are thinking about taking this tour is save your money, buy some of the ice cream, and spend the time walking around the grounds. You\\'ll have a full tummy and a nice walk in beautiful Vermont.\\nFrom journal Stowe and Burlington VT\\nby Mr. Wonka\\nBrooklyn, New York\\nMay 11, 2006\\nFrom journal Vermont Road Trip!

There is a little store and an ice-cream shop (so you can get more ice cream).\\nIt\\'s very tasty, and I would recommend checking it out if you are in the area.\\nFrom journal Burlington Area\\nRothesay, New Brunswick\\nMay 30, 2004\\nThe tasters at the end of the tour were quite popular. Of course, you have to have ice cream at the end of the tour. My favorite was the Chunky Monkey, although my favorite name had to be the Chubby Hubby. If you are in the area, there is a great stop at a combination shopping area with specialty shops of teddy bears, cheese, and chocolate on the right just before Ben and Jerry\\'s coming from Stowe. Also worth stopping in at is Cold Hollow Cider Mill.\\nFrom journal Things to see within an hour\\'s drive of Stowe\\nalbany, New York\\nJuly 7, 2003\\nWe had stopped at the store about 8 years ago and decided not to take the tour this time. The tour costs about $3 each and covers a lot of tidbits of information. If this is your first time visiting the store, you should definitely sign up. Of course, on the tour, you get free samples!\\nWhat else is there besides the tour? One stop is the gift store. There are lots of neat \"things\" to look at and to buy. If you have to buy lots of Christmas stocking stuffer gifts, this store is for you. The gifts are unique and not too expensive. And best of all they are a reminder of your vacation in Cow country! Lots of gizmos and weird things that guys like to examine.\\nIn the hallway, there are plenty of photographs and newspaper articles to read. There are some stories about the background of how a flavor was developed. There was also a newspaper article moaning fact that the yearly festival was being moved from Vermont to Woodstock, New York that I found interesting since I am from New York.\\nOutside the store the most important item of interest is the area to buy the main event: Ben & Jerry’s ice cream! And there are lots of picnic tables set up for eating your cone or dish of selected flavor! In addition, the playground apparatus are very Cow oriented themes.\\nBe sure to read more by visiting two web sites. The first is another visitor’s summary: Click here to read the professional newspaper writer’s narrative.\\nClick here to access the official company website .\\nI absolutely loved the company’s website since it was so interesting and had great graphics. It made me laugh with all of the puns you expect from a company with the history of Ben & Jerry’s, but are still surprised to see. Shameless plugs, but historical and interesting! Make sure you see the section on flavors for a change (consistent with their environmental background), the \"suggest a flavor\" section (with the comment \"you know you want to\") and the graveyard (with appropriate graphics for all of the retired flavors). The site is a barrel of laughs.\\nFrom journal Discovering Waterbury Vermont',\n",

       " {'text': 'The Success of Washington Academy is due to Dr. Jack Schwartz\\'s keen understanding of what students need within a classroom in order to be successful. His philosophy was simple, \"all students are special, but some children need special help.\"\\nThat core vision drove him to develop the Washington Academy core program over 30 years and the reputation of the school began to grow both within the special education community and throughout public schools in Northern New Jersey. Washington Academy became known as the \"school that makes a difference.\"\\nThousands of students have come through the program at Washington Academy over those 30 years with a wide array of challenges. Some students lack academic confidence and some need additional social skills support. Dr. Schwartz always saw each student for who they were, without blame. Dr. Schwartz stressed that every student within his program was a \"Washington Academy kid. And Washington Academy kids are good kids.\" By eliminating the social labels placed on students with special needs, the staff at Washington Academy could see the student for their individual personality and provide direct support for the underlying challenges that student faces.\\nEach aspect of the school addresses self-esteem, self-confidence, academic success, literacy, social skills, and making good choices in life. That is why parents of former students frequently call the school to provide updates on their children. And also why former students schedule time to come back and visit. The school is a community of learners and each member of that community is important and special.\\nDr. Schwartz always believed that with \"love, attention and affection, each child shall flourish.\" And a school that can embody those values can change the future success of any child.\\nAbout Dr. Schwartz:\\nHe began his educational career in East Harlem, NY as a teacher, where he learned how environmental issues affect how students interact with teachers and with the instution of school. He became a School Psychologist in the public school in New Jersey assessing and testing students who were identified as special needs. He then earned his Ph.D from Fordham Univeristy and continued in special education until he founded Washington Academy in 1982 in South Orange. Dr. Schwartz was a psychologist in New Jersey as well as a lecturer at Fordham University in teaching, special education and a special United States Grant graduate program in Puerto Rico.\\n\"With Love, Attention and Affection...\"\\nEducational Leadership Director (Current 2012-2013)\\nDavid Schwartz, M.A.\\nMr. Schwartz brings to Washington Academy a breadth of experience unparalled in special education and school leadership. He earned a Bachelor\\'s degree from Brandeis University in American Studies as well as media communications. He has many years experience in media communications, including several years in Trenton working with the New Jersey State Assembly. He spent a few years in the classroom as a Teacher in the Technology lab. He also has over ten years experience as a Director of Washington Academy first in school operations and now as the Educational Leadership Director, in charge of overseeing the academic curricular program, the school business office and the LCSW program. Mr. Schwartz has a certificate in School Business as well as Superintendent of Schools. He earned his Masters degree from Montclair State University in Educational Leadership.\\n\"It is an honor to continue the legacy of \\'Doc\\',\" said Mr. Schwartz. \"When a student and family choose Washington Academy as their school they get 30 years of dedication, perserverance and a \"failure is not an option\" attitude. I love and care about all the students at Washington Academy because each student deserves to have someone encouraging them daily that they can succeed despite external odds, whether real or perceived.\"\\nHe is trained in Positive Behavior Support systems, Professional Learning Communities (School Improvement Analysis) and Management (AMA). He is currently putting together a book/professional workbook to assist educators in implementing \"inclusion\" strategies in all classrooms. And he is in the development process of authoring a brand new high school program that will incorporate the College and Career ready goals of the 21st Century and plans to partner with national education book manufacturers.',\n",

       " {'text': \"Experts: Common Women's Condition Needs a New Name\\nJan. 24, 2013 -- What’s in a name? If it’s polycystic ovary syndrome, a lot of confusion, says a panel of experts convened by the NIH -- and they’re calling for a change.\\nPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is one of the most common endocrine disorders, affecting about 1 in 10 women in the U.S. It’s also a major cause of infertility. But as doctors have learned more about the complex condition, they’ve changed the way it’s diagnosed. As a result, a woman doesn’t necessarily have to have polycystic ovaries to have PCOS.\\nWhat’s more, for many women, the consequences of the disease extend beyond the ovaries. Recent research suggests PCOS may set women up for a variety of long-term health problems, including type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, heart attacks, and perhaps some kinds of cancers.\\nThe current name, experts say, doesn’t adequately reflect that.\\n“It does have a branding problem in the sense that people assume that it’s all about obesity; people assume that it’s all about diabetes; or people assume that it’s all about polycystic ovaries,” says Ricardo Azziz, MD, MPH, MBA, an obstetrician-gynecologist who specializes in PCOS. Azziz testified before the NIH panel. He’s also president of Georgia Regents University in Augusta.\\nNew Name Could Foster Funding, Education\\nCurrently, no one medical specialty claims PCOS. That makes it tough to get funding for research. It’s also difficult to educate patients and doctors about the serious and sometime long-term consequences of the syndrome.\\nWomen with PCOS don’t ovulate regularly. They also overproduce or are overly sensitive to male hormones, like testosterone. The result is a collection of symptoms that can seem unrelated. Those may include:\\n- Excess hair on the face or body\\n- Thinning of hair on the scalp\\n- Difficulty getting pregnant\\n- Depression or anxiety\\nRecent research has suggested that, at least for some women with PCOS, the hormone insulin may lie at the root of these problems. Some women with PCOS are resistant to insulin’s effects. That puts them at higher risk for problems like type 2 diabetes, high cholesterol, high blood pressure, and perhaps heart attacks and cancers of the reproductive organs.\\n“The current name focuses on only one of the criteria and actually doesn’t include a discussion about the metabolic syndrome and the metabolic consequences, the insulin resistance, and some of the other major issues that could be lifelong issues that people who have this disease or this series of diseases might have,” says panel member Timothy Johnson, MD. He is an obstetrician-gynecologist at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.\\n“Our hope was that a group or some group of people who are interested in the condition could come together very, very quickly and simply pick a name that is more inclusive,” Johnson says.\",\n",

       " {'text': \"23 Tips to Protect Yourself and Enjoy in Summer (India)\\nArticle by Rajesh Vadlamani.\\nIf you think of India, what comes to your mind? Culture, food, language, religions and what else? SUMMER! Summer in India can be very hot and at times I feel that I am thrown into Sahara desert. The temperature can reach up to 45 degree centigrade and even higher.\\nI remember my childhood days, when I used to visit my mom’s native town called Ongole (Andhra Pradesh) for summer vacation. My cousins, friends and myself would play indoor Cricket, Snake and Ladder, Judo and watch many movies via cable connection. We were blessed with water melons, “hard rock” curd and lemonade which were well prepared by my granny to beat the S factor.\\nI vividly remember one miserable experience I had during those days. On one summer noon, we all went for a short picnic to nearby paddy fields. It was very hot that day as Mr. Sun showed no mercy on us. That night I felt ill and very feverish because of Sunstroke. I felt very weak due to the loss of electrolytes and was not even able to move. If any of you had gone through the similar experience, you know what I am talking about.\\nI am posting down some tips here to help you from this deadly S factor. Try following these tips carefully and you can guard your dear ones and yourself in summer.\\n1. If you wear dark clothes, you have to pay for it. Try to wear simple and light colored cotton dresses. If you are in Chennai, you can get nice clothes at damn cheap prices, at shopping markets like Pondybazar and Purasaiwakam.\\n2. Avoid makeup as possible as you can. While you go out in Sun, apply moisturizing cream which has SPF (Sun protecting factor).\\n3. To keep your lips healthy, apply milk cream (a thin layer of cream that is formed on the surface, when you warm up the milk and then cool it down).\\n4. Massage your head with coconut oil once a week. If you apply oil to your head daily, it causes dust to stick to your hair and your face also looks greasy!\\n5. Keep a clean kerchief at handy always, to wipe your face. Try not to use tissue papers because you can help save trees!!\\n6. Take bath twice a day. Use a lemon flavored soap or a soap that contains tea tree oil. Tea tree oil helps your skin free from pimples and fungal infection. If you cannot afford it, try adding Neem leaves to your bathing water before you take bath.\\n7. You may apply talcum powder to keep yourself from excessive sweating. Nycil and Shower to Shower brands may help you in this regard.\\n8. Eyes are very delicate to the Sun's rays. You can protect your beautiful eyes by wearing goggles that cover your entire eye part. I recommend goggles which has UV protecting stuff in it.\\n9. If you are a traveling buff, you may be prone to eye infection, commonly called as Madras Eye in South India. No need to spend too much money on medication for curing Madras Eye. There are proven and much cheaper alternatives like Neem tube paste which is available in many medical stores.\\n10. You can expect heavy “snow” during summer. It is dandruff falling off your hair when you comb. These snowflakes are due to a fungal infection. You can prevent or get rid of dandruff easily by maintaining hygienic practices such as using a clean comb and a separate towel for yourself. Apply mild shampoo daily while having head bath. Dry your scalp completely. Thumb rule: “where it is wet on your body skin for a long time, some fungal infection may happen”.\\n11. Yummy! King of fruit (Mango) hits market every summer in India. Mango is a very good source of vitamins and fiber. Be careful not to be carried away by its tastiness. Eat it in the right amount!\\n12. Succulent fruits such as cucumber, water melons, tomatoes, kiwis, peaches etc are refreshing and also help your body to maintain its water levels. Come on, fill your refrigerator with these fruits rather than carbonated soft drinks. Fresh fruits are good source of anti-oxidants, vitamins and minerals. Some fruits even have the ability to prevent deadly cancer. So come on, go green guys and move to veggie and fruits.\\n13. Many people experience the problem of bad odor due to sweating. In my opinion, one should not try to avoid sweating by using antiperspirants. I would prefer to use talc, lavender oil or sandal wood oil instead of deodorants. In many cases, these essential oils are cheaper and better than branded deodorants. These are more eco friendly as they do not contain aerosols.\\nSome other miscellaneous tips to have a safe and enjoyable summer:\\n14. Do not work out during noon. It can lead to loss of ions and minerals, and quicken dehydration.\\n15. Try to avoid your children from going out especially during 10am-3pm. It has been proven that UV radiation is very high during this period.\\n16. If someone is sick due to Sunstroke, offer them electrolyte water, glucose water, tender coconut water or diluted buttermilk. This is the best first aid in my opinion.\\n17. Summer is the best season to start growing some plants in your gardens, or in pots or wherever you can find place in this “concrete jungle”. Plants add an aesthetic look to your home other than the benefit of providing fresh air. They can also prevent some dust from entering your home.\\n18. Try to avoid using air conditioners in your office and home. Rather go green! In that way, you can save electricity and cut down CFC (chloro fluro carbons). Use Vetiver mats. These “root mats” help keep your rooms cool. A little labor is required to sprinkle water over it. Encourage your children to do this work so they can learn some new stuff.\\n19. Enjoy indoor games like Chess, Snake and ladder, Scrabble, Caroms.\\n20. Teach your children to keep your home clean. Help them cultivate indoor hobbies.\\n21. Sleep on terrace during nights so you can save electricity. You will also get fresh air!\\n22. Learn about solar panels and start installing and using them.\\n23. Always carry an aluminum bottle for drinking water sake. If you are always going to buy packaged water, remember that you are polluting the environment. In a recent survey, it is found that less than twenty percent of drinking bottles are recycled in India.\\nWish you a Happy Summer!\\nto Stay Positive and up-to-date.

As a newcomer to the town, Victoria Sturgess has made her mark on the popular thoroughfare by opening a bookshop full of ‘loved and used books’ at 24 West Borough. Sitting in Victoria’s front room, it is a pleasure to be surrounded by a hand chosen collection of out-of-print books. The shelves groan at the sheer weight of choice and I was delighted to purchase ‘An Outpost in Papua’ by Arthur Kent Chignell an account of missionary work in the early 1900s. Anything written about Papua New Guinea interests me, owing to my experience of living in Wabag, Enga Province during the 1980s.\\nVictoria has always wanted to run a book shop and began purchasing books that would form the stock three years ago. Paperbacks are a sideline (along with LPs, cigarette cards and magazines) and these are displayed in a wheelbarrow that is set outside the front door whenever the shop is open. Victoria encourages customers to knock on the door to gain access outside normal opening hours or you can telephone ahead for special visiting arrangements.\\nAlready there are a number of regular visitors to Black Pug Books, and Victoria provides a social space with tea or coffee available as well as a friendly ear. She enjoys the opportunity to talk about books almost as much as selling them. All books are individually priced and Victoria is happy to undertake book searches for customers.\\nAlongside The Minster, Black Pug Books provides another good reason for visiting Wimborne.',\n",

       " {'text': 'Asus PadFone Infinity\\nWith the Mobile World Congress happening in Barcelona this week many new smartphones and gadgets have been introduced, but one that is catching the sight of many is the Asus PadFone Infinity, a phone and tablet combo that is really two devices in one to satisfy a very particular set of needs. While not a new concept, it has always remained a niche product because of the extra cost of this type of gadget. Once again, the PadFone Infinity is not cheap, but it does deliver where it counts, if you have the money to spend.\\nAccording to Asus, this device has it all. It is intuitive, providing a display of 10.1\" full HD on the tablet side and 5\" on the phone side. Both devices are unibody aluminum with a brush finish which gives them that sleek look. There is a 13MP camera for full HD videos and photos, and finally the tablet part boosts a 19h battery life. But of course, the biggest feature is the fact that it is really two devices which can be turned into one. By placing your phone into the tablet, you turn a very portable mobile phone into a much more convenient tablet able to work and provide a large display for movies or photos.\\nThe main reason someone would want such a device is to have a single place where all their data resides. Your phone is your main hub of activity, hosting photos, documents and contacts. You never have to transfer things between a phone and a tablet, because as you get home or to the office, you simply insert that phone into the tablet, and all of the power and data stored in that device become instantly available on the tablet screen. There is no boot time needed either, since the phone powers it all. Of course, all of this comes at a cost. The PadFone will be on the expensive side, around a thousand euros. Still, if you live in the UK, it will be available in April, with other countries following. (Update: You can now order the Asus Padfone here on Amazon.)',\n",

       " {'text': 'Sign of the Rat – Illustrated Action Thriller\\nAs a veteran adventurer who loves Asian destinations, my reading selections are usually travel diaries – with the occasional novel thrown into my bag for a fast-paced escape. Imagine my surprise when I found a book that brought to life my favorite places in Hanoi and kept me hooked on an exciting and unpredictable story. Sign of the Rat is an illustrated action thriller, with more than 60 photo-realistic drawings. The visuals looked especially stunning on an iPad (and it seems you could also download the book with Kindle for PC or enjoy a traditional paper copy). This fast-paced novel begins in Manhattan, then goes to Paris, but the majority of the story centers on North Vietnam. The main character is a thirteen-year-old archaeologist who lives up to his nickname – “Trouble.” I am not a fan of children’s books – yet the search behind Trouble’s adventures and the vivid writing pulled me into the story for two days – and I postponed meetings just to find out “what happens next.”\\nThe Vietnam scenes begin on the streets of Hanoi, in the tropical humidity of downtown. The prose captures the author’s experiences, a chaos of energy, with motorbikes, cyclos and trucks all jockeying for the next open space in traffic. Teens on scooters wearing the latest designer shades contrast with traditional street vendors in cone hats and linen pajamas. The smells of fresh greens and bun cha awakened my appetite and reminded me of the vendors who use little electric fans to spread the enticing smells of their grilled meats through the crowds. I particularly enjoyed the transition from modern life to the Old Quarter -\\n“They entered Old Town near a communal home with walls built around a huge tree. The strangler fig’s leafy canopy shaded the building’s roof and several more homes. The tree appeared to melt on walls like thick syrup. Strangler fig branches dropped aerial roots that over decades became thick trunks. These supplemental growths helped feed and support branches longer than a big rig tractor-trailer truck. At ground level, the tree became an impromptu Buddhist temple. Burning incense sticks jutted from knobs and tiny gift flasks of rice whiskey peppered crevices.\\nThey walked through the tree and found Hanoi’s Old Quarter to be a tangle of curving lanes, with few street signs. There was barely enough room to squeeze between tides of people. Vendors hawked rolls of cloth and plastic bags of vivid dyes, displaying more wares in the street than in their narrow shopfront. . . “\\nBeyond the shopkeepers, the main character Trouble and his friend Chiaro hide from their pursuers, with a tense visit to a water puppet performance. The smoke of firecrackers and carved wooden dragons in a pageant is a dazzling event, followed by a chase scene with a runaway vehicle.\\nLovers of Asian cuisine will enjoy the descriptions of memorable food, from humble street dumplings to sophisticated dishes. If you have ventured across Long Bien Bridge to the small dining villas and restaurants devoted to one of Vietnam’s rare specialties, then you will really enjoy the visit to a unique establishment, where dinner is caught in front of your eyes. A real surprise awaits you when you see what can be done when creatively using a particular creature for an elaborate feast. Other chapters bring alive the fusion cuisine of Hoi An, where Japanese and French influences impact delicate flavors. As a lover of traditional food, my favorite dish is cau lau, delicious pork slices in a rich broth served over hot noodles (especially with extra chili sauce and Thai basil).\\nTense action and exotic clues lead to meaningful encounters in Halong Bay. Mini-islands rise from the water like craggy eggs. The evocative scenes match my impressions of junk tours, when boats pause at the shoreline of these limestone karsts. The author shares a thrilling ride past emerald green islets, and an authentic interaction at a floating village, where the characters buy provisions before racing to their final destination. I don’t want to spoil your fun by revealing the ending, but it involves a transformation that will haunt you for a very long time. Sign of the Rat is a rare feat of storytelling. This thriller keeps you guessing about what will happen next while giving a true glimpse of Vietnam, as a colorful modern country that is alive with unique experiences.\\nThere are more special features and interactive content about this illustrated action thriller at www.SiliconValleyNovel.com.

In addition, Madrid is a city known worldwide for spaces for sports activities (the most famous building is the football stadium of Real Madrid), and cultural, politics and technologies conventions that are made throughout the year (in the Palacio de Congresos de Madrid)\\nTo serve these purposes, there is a great range of accommodation offered by the city. Although many of the hotels can be expensive, as in all European capitals, the truth is that there are countless cheaper accommodations such as “pension” and low to mid range hostels and guest houses.\\nOnce you check into a nice hotel Madrid offers a plethora of activities to choose from. We suggest planning several routes with itineraries that include both the center of the city and the outskirts of the city, which bear interesting attractions to enjoy.

Nesting dolls can be made decorated in any way the artist or designer chooses and are often made to resemble favorite characters or pets.\\nMatryoshka dolls are often used to celebrate games that people enjoy. Some of the most interesting feature nesting dolls as chess playing pieces. These sets are unique and may include the King, Queen, Rook, Bishop, Knight and Pawn as interesting conversation starters. Other games and game characters, such as Mario and company, are adorable as Matryoshka dolls.\\nDIY Nesting Dolls\\nUsing kits of blank nesting dolls, a designer, artist or DIY crafter can create anything they can imagine. Matryoshka dolls must nest inside each other, so hand painting them is a popular option. Some designers are creative with fabric and felt and create the look of more traditional soft dolls with their kits.\\nFavorite characters from movies, books and folklore are also often featured on nesting dolls. Santas of all varieties are collectors’ items, so it only makes sense that Santa Matryoshka dolls are readily available. Best loved characters from movies and cartoons also make nesting dolls really special to collectors.\\nWorld Leader Nesting Dolls\\nDictators, presidents and world leaders are commemorated in Matryoshka dolls quite frequently. Collectors value these nesting dolls as historic timestamps, as the leader’s look during a particular election of time in power is recorded on each set of dolls. Russian presidents are a particularly popular subject of Matryoshka dolls.\\nPets and Animals\\nFrom endangered species to beloved family pets, nearly all types of animals have been featured on Matryoshka dolls.

       " {'text': 'Jenesys Inc. has created a series of Flat Pack PreFab homes that are energy efficient, affordable and great looking. From their British Columbia studio they design first rate houses that are pre-fabricated by a local Structural Insulating Panel (SIP) factory. SIPs are pre-fabricated exterior wall and roof panels made up of a thick slab of foam insulation sandwiched between two layers of plywood or oriented strand board. The resulting SIP panel is very insulative and much stronger than \"stick\" or traditional stud construction.\\nCompared with Modular PreFab, Flat Pack PreFabs are much less finished. All interior finishes, stairs, plumbing and mechanicals need to be contracted for separately. What you get with the Jenesys system is a home design that has had many of the bugs worked out and the architectural design costs spread over many installations.\\nI particularly appreciate Jenesys showing some very nice smaller house designs that reduce the amount of raw materials used in construction and are more energy efficient.R-Values. Recent tests by Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) showed a SIP structure had 90% less air leakage than an identical structure built with 2x6\" walls using fiberglass insulation. And, according to Jeff Christian, ORNL director of the laboratory\\'s Building Technologies Center, an INSULSPAN 4\" SIP wall delivered a whole wall R-Value of 13.83, compared to R-9.68 for 2x4\" framed walls with fiberglass insulation, and R-11 for a typically constructed 2x6\" wall with fiberglass insulation.\\nSince air leakage accounts for 30 to 40% of the energy loss in the average home, air sealing measures and insulation should be considered in tandem as a single solution for keeping conditioned air in your home. With SIPs, you get dramatically less air leakage, better insulation and more comfort.\\nI have found that using SIPs allows you to save on mechanical equipment, because you need a smaller furnace and air conditioner/heat pump. You also save time. When coordinated properly, you can install the building foundation while the factory cuts the unique panels for your project. When the panels arrive they can be tilted up and made weather tight much faster than with â€œstickâ€ construction.\\nThanks to Jenesys Assistant Manager Jenesysck Brummer for answering questions about their SIP design process + photos.\\nwritten by dan malott, April 13, 2007\\nwritten by Jamie Pero, April 14, 2007\\nwritten by Used Pole Trailers, March 24, 2010\\n|< Prev||Next >|',\n",

It was a fun-filled evening with more than 64 local business owners and visitors in attendance, some from as far away as Death Valley, Bishop and Ridgecrest.\\nThe event was hosted by Jaque and Art Hickman at the Boulder Creek RV Park. With a hosted bar, members and guests were treated to a wonderful dinner which included delicious baby back ribs, warm potato salad and beans with bacon, donated and prepared by Dave Haas with the assistance of the Boulder Creek RV Park staff. A shrimp cocktail salad, cheese and bread were provided by Erick Schat’s Bakkerÿ , and delicious bread pudding from the Merry-Go-Round Restaurant were also served. While the dinner and open bar were free, more than $1,000 in donations were collected to support the Chamber.\\nThe guest speaker for the evening was Clifford Beddingfield, the local outreach coordinator with Praxis Associates based in Bishop. Beddingfield is working on the Digital 395 Middle Mile Project under the California Broadband Cooperative. He gave a brief overview of the $101 million project and the timeline for completion, which is expected to bring high-speed broadband to Inyo County by the end of July of 2013. In response to concerns from the audience on whether or not outside contractors will be brought in to do the work, he explained the project is obligated to use local contractors experienced in a number of areas, mostly trenching and excavation. He noted that there is a requirement to use laborers from the local area as well, and that job training will be provided.\\nAccording to Beddingfield the new 583-mile, fiber network will provide a 10 gigabyte high capacity fiber optic middle mile and back haul route which will essentially follow the U.S. Route 395 highway and will extend from Barstow to Reno, Nev. The project’s proposed service area encompasses 36 communities (including the Town of Benton off U.S. Route 6), six Indian reservations and two military bases. Unused, high-capacity fiber will be available to the region’s last mile providers such as Lone Pine TV, Suddenlink Communications in Bishop, NPG Cable in Mammoth and others to expand or enhance service to households and businesses.\\nDr. Ben Jones was recognized as the Chamber’s Volunteer of the Year for his work over the past 30-plus years making the Wild Wild West Marathon a success.

It separates from the Naviglio Grande at Abbiategrasso and heads south, reaching Bereguardo at the Ticino Rive. Ships which from the Po, sailed up the first part of the Ticino, and wanted to reach Milan, had to be transferred over land to this canal, and then sailed up the Naviglio Grande to reach the city. Use of the canal started to decline in the 1800s, when Naviglio Pavese was completed, which, thanks to an elaborate system of locks, directly connects Milan with the Ticino, a short distance from where it flows into the Po.

Consequently, the result here involves larger uncertainties. The reason is that the regular changeover of the consumer price index from base year 2000 to the new base year 2005 has not been completed yet.\\nOn 29 February 2008, the final result for January 2008, the provisional result for February 2008 and recalculated results from January 2005 on the new basis 2005 = 100 will be released. Then the price trend will be shown in a breakdown by product groups again.\\nThe year-on-year rate of change of the harmonised consumer price index for Germany, which is calculated for European purposes, is estimated at +3.0% for January 2008. In December 2007, the rate of change was +3.1%. Compared with the previous month, the index will be down by 0.3% in January 2008.\\nAccording to provisional results of the Federal Statistical Office retail trade decreased in December 2007 a nominal 4.9% and a real 6.9% compared with the corresponding month of the previous year. The number of days open for sale was 24 in December 2007 and 24 in December 2006, too. Obviously there is a certain base effect here given the pre VAT increase in sales in December 2006, but still, the level is really shockingly low.\\nWhen adjusted for calendar and seasonal variations (CENSUS-X-12-ARIMA), the December 2007 turnover was in nominal terms 0.4% and in real terms 0.1 smaller than that of the preceding month.\\nIn 2007 turnover in retail trade in Germany was in nominal terms 1.2% and in real terms 2.2% smaller than that of the previous year.\\nSales, adjusted for inflation and seasonal swings, declined 0.1 percent from November, when they dropped 1.9 percent, the Federal Statistics Office in Wiesbaden said today. Germans seem to have maintained a rather discrete level of spending after inflation accelerated last year to the fastest pace since records began in 1996, driven by a higher sales tax and rising energy prices. Retail sales fell for a fourth month in January, the Bloomberg PMI showed yesterday.\\nConsumer prices rose 3 percent from a year earlier in January using a harmonized European Union method, the statistics office reported today. That\\'s well above the European Central Bank\\'s 2 percent limit on annual price gains.\\nConsumer spending appears to have been hit recent by fears about inflation – German retail sales fell by 1.8 per cent in the fourth quarter of last year, according to official figures. Employment data appeared to paint a more upbeat picture - German seasonally-adjusted unemployment fell by a sharper-than-expected 89,000 this month to the lowest level for 15 years - however unemployment trends have a well known tendency to lag behind other developments in economic activity.\\nEurozone inflation has soared to a 14-year high of 3.2 per cent, adding to the European Central Bank’s case a hard-line stance on future interest rate moves.\\nThe unexpected rise from 3.1 per cent in December suggests that the “hump” in inflation caused by higher energy and food prices will prove larger and longer-lasting than anticipated by the ECB. January’s rate was the highest since the Frankfurt-institution took responsibility for monetary policy in the region in 1999.\\nEmployment growth remained robust in December 2007. According to provisional calculations of the Federal Statistical Office, the number of persons in employment in December was up by 596,000 or 1.5% on December 2006. Compared with November 2007 the number of persons in employment was down by 139,000, which was a smaller decline than is usual at this time of the year. In December 2007, there were 40.15 million persons in employment whose place of residence was Germany.\\nThe relative increase compared with December 2006 (+1.5%) was slightly smaller than the respective increases for September, October and November (+1.6% each on a year earlier). However we need to take into account of the favourable employment situation in December 2006 (the high base effect).\\nAs is usual at that time of the year, the number of people in employment decreased in December 2007 on the previous month. Compared with November, it was down by 139,000. That was a markedly smaller decrease than the November-to-December decreases observed on an average of the previous five years (–178,000).\\nThe impression of robust growth is supported by the trend of the seasonally adjusted number of persons in employment, that is upon elimination of the typical seasonal fluctuations. Compared with November, the number was up by 37,000 persons. The growth of the seasonally adjusted number of persons in employment even increased slightly since July.\\nBased on the labour force survey, Destatis published a seasonally adjusted 3.35 million unemployed for December 2007. Compared with the same month a year earlier (December 2006), the number of unemployed was down by 530,000 persons or 13.6%. The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate – which is harmonised at the EU level and measured as the share of unemployed in the total labour force – amounted to 7.8% and was thus considerably below the level of the corresponding month of the previous year (9.0%).\\nFriday, January 25, 2008\\nThe sub-indicator measuring willingness to spend rose to minus 8.8 from minus 10.7 and households are more optimistic about the economic outlook, with a gauge rising to 28.7 from 23.6. But perhaps most importantly, the measure of consumers\\' income expectations fell to minus 4.7 from minus 1.7.\\nFor income expectations to ``stabilize, it is essential that some calm returns to price developments,\\'\\' GfK said in its statement. German inflation accelerated last year to 2.3 percent, the fastest pace since harmonized euro-region records began in 1996, driven by a higher sales tax and rising energy prices, while consumer-price inflation slowed to 3.1 percent in December from 3.3 percent in November.\\nThursday, January 24, 2008\\nThursday, January 17, 2008\\nAs regards the use side, economic growth was based on both foreign and domestic demand. Price-adjusted exports saw a by far higher rise (+8.3%) than imports (+5.7%). The increased export surplus (net exports) contributed 1.4% percentage points to GDP growth, while the contribution of domestic uses was one percentage point. This development was above all determined by gross fixed capital formation in machinery and equipment: In 2007, capital formation of enterprises in new machinery, equipment and vehicles again increased considerably (+8.4%) on a year earlier. Final consumption expenditure contributed 0.2 percentage points to economic growth. However, only final consumption expenditure of general government had a positive impact (price-adjusted growth rate +2.0%), while the real final consumption expenditure of households declined 0.3% on a year earlier. On an annual average in 2007, the economic performance was achieved by slightly more than 39.7 million persons in employment, which was an increase of 649,000 persons (+1.7%) compared with the preceding year.\\nAccording to provisional calculations,net lending and net borrowing of general government (including central government, state government, local government and social security funds) were in balance in 2007. When put in relation to the GDP at current prices the financial position ratio is in the black. On 14 February 2008, the Federal Statistical Office will publish first national accounting results for the fourth quarter of 2007 and the revised results for the year 2007 (only GDP); on 26 February, the detailed results will be released.\\nOn an annual average in 2007, the economic performance was achieved by slightly more than 39.7 million persons in employment, which was an increase of 649,000 persons (+1.7%) compared with the preceding year. Hence employment reached its highest level since German reunification in 2007. According to provisional results of the labour force survey, the number of unemployed persons (international definition) decreased by 641,000 (−15.1%) to 3.6 million. Increases in labour productivity measured as the price-adjusted gross domestic product per person in employment and per hour worked amounted to 0.8% each in 2007. Hence they were clearly below the growth rates (+2.2% and +2.4%, respectively) observed in 2006.\\nAs regards the production side of the gross domestic product (price-adjusted), all economic sectors had a positive impact on economic growth in 2007. Industry experienced a particularly strong growth. Its gross value added was up 5.2% on a year earlier. Economic performance also saw a clear rise in trade, transport and communications (+2.3%), in financial, real-estate, renting and business activities (+3.1%) and in agriculture, hunting, forestry and fishing (+2.7%). Furthermore economic performance improved by 1.7% in construction. However, the economic upturn which started in 2006 (at that time, price-adjusted gross value added increased 5.4%) thus slowed down markedly.\\nGross value added of other service activities increased 0.6% on the previous year. As regards the use of the gross domestic product, economic growth in 2007 was based on both foreign and domestic demand. The continued foreign demand for German goods and services led to an 8.3% increase in exports. The rise observed in imports was 5.7% and hence clearly below the export level. The resulting price-adjusted export surplus (net exports) contributed 1.4% percentage points to GDP growth. Domestic uses contributed one percentage point to growth based, above all, on gross fixed capital formation. In price-adjusted terms, the latter saw an increase of 4.9% on 2006. Gross fixed capital formation in machinery and equipment again had a substantial effect on growth: Capital formation of enterprises in machinery, equipment and vehicles increased 8.4% on a year earlier.\\nHowever, gross fixed capital formation in construction was up not more than 2.0%. This increase was almost completely attributable to gross fixed capital formation in non-residential buildings, which rose 4.3%. Hence the positive development of 2006 continued (+4.3%, too). Price-adjusted gross fixed capital formation in residential construction climbed only 0.3%. Thus the growth rate was clearly smaller than the rate recorded a year earlier (+4.3%). Final consumption expenditure contributed 0.2 percentage points to economic growth.\\nHowever, only final consumption expenditure of general government had a positive effect on growth (price-adjusted growth rate +2.0%). Final consumption expenditure of households declined 0.3% in 2007 on a year earlier, which resulted in a negative contribution to growth of 0.2 percentage points. In 2006, final consumption expenditure of households still made a positive contribution to growth (0.6 percentage points). Certainly, the above two results also reflect the rise in value added tax which led to purchases in 2006 that had originally been planned for a later time. The national income (factor costs), the two components of which are compensation of employees and property and entrepreneurial income, rose to EUR 1,825 billion (+ 4.2%) in 2007. While compensation of employees (EUR 1,180 billion) was up 2.6% on a year earlier, property and entrepreneurial income saw an increase of 7.2% to EUR 645 billion.\\nThe share of compensation of employees in the national income at factor costs (wage ratio) declined to 64.6%; that was one percentage point less compared with the previous year. Gross wages and salaries increased to EUR 954 billion (+3.1%) in 2007. The last time a higher increase was recorded was in 2000 (+3.4%). Net wages and salaries, which are obtained after deduction of wage tax and employees’ social contributions, amounted to nearly EUR 620 billion and hence were 2.3% above the level of the previous year. While employees’ social contributions recorded a comparatively moderate rise of 2.7%, employee wage tax was up 6.2% according to first provisional results. This strong increase was, among other things, due to the clear rise observed in the number of jobs fully subject to social insurance contributions and to changes in income tax law (for instance, elimination or restriction of commuter tax allowance).\\nThe number of employees was up 1.7% in 2007. Average gross wages and salaries (per employee) climbed 1.3%, while average net wages and salaries increased 0.5%. In 2007, the disposable income of households rose 1.6% to EUR 1,518 billion. Compared to 2006, consumer reticence of households was again stronger in 2007 so that the growth (+1.4%) of household final consumption expenditure (at current prices) was even smaller than the moderate increase observed in the disposable income. The saving ratio climbed to 10.8%, which was an increase of 0.3 percentage points on a year earlier. According to provisional calculations,net lending and net borrowing of general government (including central government, state government, local government and social security funds) were in balance in 2007. When put in relation to the GDP at current prices the financial position ratio is in the black. On 14 February 2008, the Federal Statistical Office will publish first national accounting results for the fourth quarter of 2007 and the revised results for the year 2007 (only GDP); on 26 February 2008, the detailed results will be released.\\nThe results published in August 2007 for the years 1991 to 2006 have not been revised, as is always the case at this time of the year. The above and other national accounts data may be accessed via the internet (http://www.destatis.de/). In addition, more detailed results are published in Fachserie 18 “Volkswirtschaftliche Gesamtrechnungen”, Reihe 1.1 “Erste Jahresergebnisse” (order number 2180110).

In 2007, prices of energy products (household energy and motor fuels) rose 3.9%. Among all energy prices, electricity prices increased most strongly (+6.8%). Mineral oil products in 2007 were on average by 3.0% more expensive than in 2006 (of which motor fuels: +4.1%; liquid fuel: –1.2%).\\nStripping out energy prices, the annual average of the year-on-year rate of price increase would have been 1.9%. The marked rise in the annual year-on-year rate of price increase in 2007, exceeding the two-percent threshold, was increasingly driven in the second half of the year by successive price rises for food (+3.1% on an annual average in 2007), in particular for some milk, flour and fat products by two-digit rates (including butter: +19.1%; flour: +15.4%; curd: +12.0% and full-cream milk: +10.3%).\\nFurthermore, the higher prices of education had an impact on the rate of price change already since April 2007, especially because of the introduction of tuition fees in some Länder. Also, prices of alcoholic beverages and tobacco (+3.1%) increased above average on an annual average in 2007; however, price increases were smaller than the total consumer price increase, for example, for consumer durables (+0.9%), clothing (+0.8%) and communication (+0.2%).\\nIn December 2007, the consumer price index was up 2.8% on December 2006. Since September, the year-on-year rate of price increase constantly exceeded the two-percent threshold. November saw the annual peak (+3.1%), while in December the price rise slowed down a little (+2.8%). Compared with the previous month, the index was up 0.5% in December. In a year-on-year comparison, energy prices had an upward effect in December 2007, as was the case in the previous months, although prices of mineral oil products decreased towards the end of the month (including motor fuels: +11.9% on December 2006 and –5.4% on November 2007). Not considering the price trend of energy products (household energy and motor fuels), the year-on-year rate of price increase in December 2007 would have been only 2.2%. Mineral oil product prices were up 14.5% (including liquid fuel: +25.1%). Electricity prices, too, rose above average in December 2007 (+8.2% on a year earlier), whereas gas prices were down 2.4%.\\nFood prices in December 2007 were up an average 6.0% on December 2006. Prices rose considerably – as in the previous months – especially for oils and fats (+25.5%; including butter: +44.9%) as well as milk, cheese and eggs (+17.3%; including curd: +37.8%). Prices of bread and cereals, too, were markedly higher than a year earlier (+6.0%), including flour: +27.6%. For some items, however, price rises were markedly smaller than total consumer prices, that is, among other things, communication (+0.8%) and clothing (+0.1%). The marked 0.5% increase in the price index from November 2007 to December 2007 was mainly due to seasonal price trends.\\nWhat should especially be mentioned apart from price increases for some fruits and vegetables (including grapes: +16.0% and lettuce: +13.1%) is common price rises caused by the seasonal highlights (Christmas and New Year’s Eve) for package holidays (+32.5% on November 2007) and accommodation services (+20.8%). Seasonal month-on-month increases were also observed towards the end of the year for air fares (on average +6.7%) and rail fares (on average +3.6%). A consumer-friendly month-on-month trend was however shown especially by motor fuel prices (–5.4%; including supergrade petrol: –5.9%). For clothing and footwear, too, first price reductions on the previous month were observed (–1.0%) because of the coming seasonal change from the winter to the spring collections.\\nThe harmonised consumer price index for Germany, which is calculated for European purposes, rose 2.3% on an annual average in 2007. In December 2007, the harmonised consumer price index was up 3.1% on December 2006. Compared with the previous month, the index climbed 0.7%. The estimates of 28 December 2007 were thus confirmed both for the consumer price index and for the harmonised consumer price index. Detailed information on consumer price statistics is contained in Fachserie 17, Reihe 7, which is available free of charge from the publication service of the Federal Statistical Office at www.destatis.de/publikationen, search word “Verbraucherpreisindex\\nConsumer prices rose 2.3 percent in 2007, using a harmonized European Union method, the Federal Statistics Office in Wiesbaden said in a statement today. It\\'s the first year the increase in Europe\\'s largest economy breached the European Central Bank\\'s limit. Measured by national rules, inflation averaged 2.2 percent, the highest level since 1994.\\nAs the effect on inflation of an increase in value-added tax last January wanes, ECB policy makers are concerned that rising oil and food prices will lead workers to seek higher pay and spark a wage-price spiral.\\n``It\\'s a dramatic figure, but it was boosted by the VAT hike,\\'\\' said Luigi Speranza, an economist at BNP Paribas in London. ``While the inflation rate has peaked, elevated food prices will keep it above 2 percent until at least mid-year.\\'\\' The ECB targets an increase of just below 2 percent.\\nIn December, inflation slowed to 3.1 percent from 3.3 percent the previous month, matching both the median in a survey of 29 economists and preliminary figures from Dec. 28. From November, consumer prices rose 0.7 percent.\\nElectricity & Butter\\nThe price of butter rose 19 percent last year, and the cost of milk gained 10 percent, the statistics office said. Electricity prices increased 6.8 percent and car fuel rose 4.1 percent. Excluding energy costs the national inflation rate was 1.9 percent. Heating oil costs declined 1.2 percent.\\nIn the euro area, European inflation averaged 2.1 percent in 2007, staying above the ECB\\'s ceiling for an eighth year even after policy makers doubled interest rates in the 18 months through June last year. Inflation stayed at the highest in more than six years in December as food and energy costs soared.\\nECB council member Axel Weber said yesterday that the bank won\\'t tolerate pay increases that fuel inflation. ``There are indications of intensifying wage pressure, in particular in the public service,\\'\\' Weber said. ``We\\'ll counter second-round effects as well as other risks\\'\\' to price stability ``resolutely.\\'\\'\\nGerman public-sector workers want the biggest pay raise in 16 years. Ver.di, Germany\\'s second-biggest labor union, is seeking 8 percent more for about 1.3 million workers on federal and local government payrolls.\\nExpectations, as measured by the break-even level of 10-year inflation-linked French government bonds, have risen 11 basis points to 2.19 percent since the ECB shelved plans to raise interest rates on Sept. 6 following a rout in U.S. subprime mortgages.\\nThe Federal Statistics Office will publish a flash estimate of January inflation on Jan. 31. The six German states that provide the data for the estimate will not release figures separately this month, resuming normal procedure in February.\\nTuesday, January 15, 2008\\nToday we also learnt from the Federal Statistics Office that German economic growth slowed to 2.5 percent in 2007 from 2.9 percent in 2006. At the present moment the Bundesbank is predicting growth of some 1.9 percent this year, but it is evident that the number of downside risks to this forcast are now growing almost by the day.\\nGerman industrial production, exports and retail sales all declined in November, suggesting the economy is gradually losing momentum as a stronger euro makes exports less competitive even as the global economy slows, and record oil and food prices drive up inflation. Higher credit costs will may also restrain company investmen. The Munich based Ifo institute said in December that it expects company spending on equipment to grow about 4 percent in 2008 after increasing by 9.2 percent in 2007.\\nWednesday, January 9, 2008\\nRetail sales in November also dropped 1.3 percent. More importantly ...\"as shown by estimates of the Federal Statistical Office (Destatis), the 2007 nominal retail turnover in Germany is expected to be between 0.7% and 1.0% smaller than in 2006.\"\\nAlso industrial production fell 0.9 percent in November from October, the Economy Ministry in Berlin said today. Equally importantly construction output was down 1.6 percent from October.\\nEntering Reform Fatigue?\\nOne of the thing which strikes me about all those false hopes for a sustained recovery that people are forever being offered in Germany and Japan is the corrosive effect that this can have on the psychology of all the ordinary people who are on the receiving end.\\nWhat Claus and I have been noticing is just how hard it is for people to take seriously the idea that there may be a long term underlying problem in these countries associated with years of very low fertility and population ageing. In both countries now, after years of hard and difficult reforms - what the Economist calls \"cultural changes\" - people may be less ready to receive yet another dose, and will quite possibly be willing to try different ideas and other formulas. Some indication of this is to be seen in the recent defaut of the LDP in the Japanese Upper House elections and the early departure of Abe.\\nSo enter another argument. Consumption is weak because wages and salaries are too low. Companies in Germany and Japan have lots of profits,while what they don\\'t have are wages, and hence internal consumption. To some extent, of course, this is the case. The question is why.If wages are trending downward in Italy, Japan and Germany as aggregate population age rises there may be some productivity and human capital related explanation for this, as I explain in my recent extensive study on the German labour market.\\nSo it may be that - as the Financial Times reports this morning - we see some serious attempt in the short term to raise wages.\\n\"German government and union officials gather on Thursday in the baroque town of Potsdam outside Berlin to start wage negotiations for the country\\'s 1.3m civil servants, kicking off what the head of the country\\'s largest trade union predicted would be a year of \"mega-wage deals\". After years of wage stagnation in Europe\\'s biggest economy, calls for substantial pay increases are growing louder – and prompting warnings from economists about the potential impact on jobs and inflation.\"\\nSuch an attempt to increase the wages share in German National Income in not supported by productivity and value chain shifts will, unfortunately, do more harm than good by slowing down the pace of job creation, and pushing up inflation in the short term. Since this will be unsustainable, as the economy slows the danger can then very rapidly shift from inflation to deflation. There are now no easy \"instant coffee\" policy solutions available to the underlying problem in Germany. The first step in begining to make the best of a bad job would be to recognise that what is happening actually is happening. Reading the majority of commentators at this point I fear we are still a long way from that recognition, so it seems things will continue to get worse before there is any chance of them getting better. I emphasise, the most important step towards begining to do what can be done now in Germany passes through a general recognition of the problem being faced. Without this there is little hope of real progress.\\nConclusion, Have We Been Here Before?\\nTo close, just a couple more graphs. We can see from the most recent export y-o-y chart that export growth is now slowing significantly, and that we are now entering the downward phase of the whole cycle. We have, of course, been here before, after the collapse of the internet boom.\\nIt may be worth reminding ourselves at this point what ectually happened last time round, ie the last time the acceleration in the Y-o-Y growth rates in German exports effectively stalled. That was back in early 2000, as we can see from the chart below. And what happened at that next? Well the fed was easing as the US entered recession, and the euro was to some extent rising, both of which put a strong break on German exports. And after export growth collapsed, German GDP growth wasn\\'t far behind. So it isn\\'t the rise in the currency alone that matters, you have to think about the whole environment which produces it. Why your currency is rising, while someone else\\'s is falling. And of course, in German export terms, after the rise comes the fall. This is the cost of not being able to depend on your own internal demand, you have to depend on someone else\\'s demand.\\nSecondly, we should also think about what happens to employment creation and unemployment as GDP growth stalls. The chart below offers a comparison of movements in the two main unemployment indicators for Germany - the ILO comparable one, and the national German one - from the early 1990s to date. As can be seen the stall in GDP growth produced the rapid rise in umeployment after the summer of 2000, as win-win became lose-lose. I don\\'t see why the picture shoud be that different this time round. The ageing population component in the slowdown will - if anything - be worse this time (the median age is higher). The labour market arguments are outlined in much more depth in this post.\\nThe German economy is losing momentum as a stronger euro makes exports less competitive and near-record oil prices drive up inflation, leaving households with less money to spend. German Finance Minister Peer Steinbrueck said today the government may cut its 2008 growth forecast.\\nConstruction output was also down in November 2007, falling 1.6% from October.\\nGermany\\'s IWH institute last month cut its growth forecast for 2008, citing both weaker exports and consumption. The pace of expansion may slow to 1.7 percent this year from 2.5 percent in 2007, Halle-based IWH said Dec. 20. It previously forecast growth of 2.5 percent for this year. The German government may lower its 2008 growth forecast when it publishes a new projection later this month, Steinbrueck said in an interview today.\\n``I think we\\'re not going to face the same economic growth rate as in 2007,\\'\\' Steinbrueck said. ``Perhaps 1.9 percent or 1.8 percent\\'\\' instead of the 2 percent currently projected.\\nAdding to signs of slowdown, German business confidence fell to the lowest in almost two years in December and investors were the most pessimistic since January 1993.\\nThe euro increased 11 percent against the dollar last year, reaching a record $1.4967 on Nov. 23. The currency, used in 15 European countries, traded at $1.4704 at 1 p.m. in Frankfurt. Todays report showed that exports rose 3.2 percent during 2007. The trade surplus, adjusted for seasonal swings and working days, widened to 19.8 billion euros -- the most since records began in 1950 -- as imports dropped more than exports.\\nMonday, January 7, 2008\\nThe above charts are striking, as is the entire recent performance of the German economy in terms of job creation, but before we go any further I think at this point it is also worth taking into account the following information release on German unemployment statistics from the EU Statistics Office, Eurostat (full reference at the foot of this post):\\nMonthly data for Germany from the Labour Force Survey (LFS) is only available since early 2005, and this is not sufficiently long a time series to enable reliable seasonal adjustment using standard techniques. Eurostat considers the minimum length of a series for testing the extraction of the seasonal pattern to be four years for the monthly unemployment data. It is thus unlikely that seasonal patterns in the unemployment directly measured by the LFS are sufficiently known until early 2011. Until then an alternative method, such as using information from auxiliary sources, needs to be applied.\\nI introduce this quote at this stage in the argument, since it is important to note that nothing - or virtually nothing - here is what it seems to be. Germany has recently introduced a whole new methodology for measuring unemployment - a monthly (as opposed to an earlier annual) labour force survey (more below) and this fact alone already makes inter-temporal comparisons of unemployment data tricky, to say the least.\\nNonetheless there can be no doubt that unemployment is falling, and quite rapidly, in Germany. It is how to interpret this data which is what we need to think about. In its most recent monthly report for example the Federal Labour Agency said seasonally-adjusted unemployment had dropped by 78,000 to 3.4m, almost twice the average monthly fall in the past year. Altogether, more than half-a-million people have come off jobless benefits in the past year. The internationally comparable (ILO harmonised) jobless rate, whose publication lags one month behind the national data, stood at 7.9 per cent in November - the lowest level since the end of 2001 – thanks to robust economic growth, an increase in hiring, and a fall in the number of people claiming unemployment benefits.\\nMore surprising to many of us who are watching the current course of the German economy than the figures themselves was the publication of a series of business sentiment surveys which appear to show continued resilient hiring intentions among managers even as the German economy shows visible signs of slowing. These suggest the improvement in the data we are receiving for the labour market should continue, and that the decline in the numers of unemployed - which has now been taking pace for some 21 months - should continue at least into the near future. The Ifo institute’s employment barometer, for example, stood at 106.8 points in December, markedly above the average registered over the past 12 months. So what is actually happening? Well my guess is that nobody really knows. And I do not pretend to have the magic lantern here, but I have spent considerable time over the past 24 hours trying to find some light at the end of the cavern, and what follows is a provisional account of my finding.\\nThe Hartz Reform\\nNow the more astute among you will have noticed that in the above chart for unemployment rates, I present Germany\\'s unemployment as measured on two different concepts. The first is the new German Labour Force Survey Methodology - which as I have already pointed out was only introduced last October - and the second is measured using the internationally comparable ILO methodology. The basic difference is that the ILO methodology uses the idea of actively seeking work, while the Federal methodology has previously been based on the concept of simply being registered, irrespective of whether or not the intention is to find work. Naturally the level as measured using ILO criteria (although this is a rather complex issue) has tended to be lower. But the even more astute among you will have noted that over the last two years these two measures have gradually come together. As far as I can see this growing similarity between the two readings is the result of a confluence of two factors. Firstly the new methodology the Federal Statistics Office introduced last October (2007), and secondly the series of reforms which have come to be known as the \"Hartz Concept\".\\nNow as regards the first, starting from the release of 31 October 2007 the Federal Statistics Office has replaced their earlier, temporary, method of calculating harmonised monthly unemployment for Germany by a new method. This new method bases the unemployment estimates on the new continuous (monthly) German Labour Force Survey (LFS), and in so doing Germany has brought itself into line with the methods used for the other Member States of the European Union.\\nThe reason for this change is that Germany\\'s earlier methods of gathering employment and unemployment data was, to put it rather mildly, in something of a mess. Now regulation EC 1991/2002 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 8 October 2002 made the continuous, quarterly LFS mandatory for all Member States from 2003, although it did specifically provide, among other things, a transitional period for Germany, a period which could last until 2005.\\nBasically in all the countries of the European Union, the LFS is used to derive quarterly results, however, in order to provide unemployment rates and data with a monthly frequency, short-term trends from unemployment registers are also used to update the much more detailed findings of the quarterly LFS. Now, prior to 2005, the Labour Force Survey was only conducted on an annual basis in Germany. During one week every spring, information concerning labour force status was provided by respondents during detailed interviews. This methodology was considered to be totally unsatisfactory when viewed from the persective of establishing a harmonised EU unemployment measure, consequently the German system has been in transition, and it is this transition that can best be seen in the way in which the German rate has steadily come closer to the ILO methodology one.\\nHowever, as luck would have it, precisely in January 2005, at exactly the time the new continuous LFS commenced in Germany, the German Federal Government introduced an extensive reform of the social security system, areform which included among its objectives the bringing together under one roof of unemployment and social welfare benefits. The measures involved are usually referred to as Hartz IV. Since the Hartz concept effectively involved a redefinition of what constituted unemployment, and more importantly who would be entitled to benefit, it was already anticipated at the time of framing the legislation that there would be significant effects on the registered level of unemployment at the system was introduced.\\nTherefore, the assumption was from the outset that the register of unemployment as measured in the annual LFS would not give a very accurate reading of the level of German unemployment over an unspecified period, and that this period of uncertainty and undecideability would commence in precisely January 2005. During the transitional period it was not considered practical for the Federal Labour Agency ito maintain a separate time series, and thus the compromise solution was adopted that they would continue to use the old definitions of registered unemployment.\\nUnder those circumstances it proved impossible to produce reliable harmonised monthly unemployment rates for Germany. While work was ongoing to make the continuous LFS suitable for the production of monthly unemployment figures, Eurostat and Destatis looked for a temporary alternative. For this purpose Destatis expanded the ILO Monthly Telephone Survey (MTS) that had been running from April 2003 as a pilot survey to 30 000 interviews per month. The MTS would run until April 2007. Eurostat agreed to use, for a limited time, the results from the Monthly Telephone Survey for estimating the harmonised unemployment rate for Germany. When the temporary measure of basing the unemployment estimation on the Monthly Telephone Survey was introduced the effect was a downward shift in the time series for the total unemployment rate for Germany. And, of course, it is this effect that we are now seeing.\\nWithin Europe, the German Labour Force Survey is the largest household survey of its kind. The average sample size per month is around 30 000 dwellings, with completed interviews of persons of working age approximately 35 000 on average each month. The survey is part of the German Micro-Census and has a very high response rate (approx. 95% annually) compared to other Member States and a relatively low rate of proxy6 answers (approx. 27%). All households are visited and interviewed by specially trained interviewers using portable computers, but those respondents who so wish can complete the questionnaire on their own on paper.\\nThe replacement of the provisional unemployment figures based on the Monthly Telephone Survey by the estimates from the LFS results in a major upward revision. The LFS measures a significantly higher level of unemployment in Germany than the MTS. The chart below - which was prepared by Eurostat, shows the level of unemployment in Germany from 2000 to September 2007, showing the previous Eurostat estimates based on the Monthly Telephone Survey as well as the revised estimates based on the Labour Force Survey.\\nSome indication of the chaos and confusion which all this has caused can be seen in this extract from the Federal Statistics Office report on the changeover. According to the Federal Statistics Bureau\\nThe number of unemployed as determined according to the ILO concept in January 2005 (3.99 million) was by about one million below the number of registered unemployed in the same month according to the Social Security Code (5.04 million). According to the results of the telephone survey, about 1.2 million persons were recorded as unemployed who indicated not to be registered as unemployed. On the other hand, 2.2 million respondents who, as indicated by themselves, were registered as unemployed were not unemployed according to the ILO concept. As is shown by experience acquired in the pilot surveys, the resulting difference between unemployment (ILO concept) and registered unemployment (Federal Employment Agency) is larger in winter than on an annual average due to seasonal factors. Also, it is assumed that the statistical “Hartz IV effect” contributed to the difference observed in January this year. While the Hartz IV reform increased the registered unemployment according to the Social Security Code, as observed by the Federal Employment Agency, beyond the level that is usual at this time of the year, the ILO unemployment figure is not influenced by such statistical effects caused by changes in law.\\nWell I think we can leave this part of the story there. Unemployment either was always much higher than was officially recognised, or never rose as much as it appeared to at the start of 2005. Choose your own version. But what we should be aware of is that the reduction in unemplyment which appeasr to be taking place in Germany needs to be handled with a good deal of care.\\nThe Hartz Concept\\nAccording to Wikipedia, the Hartz Concept may be defined as follows:\\nThe Hartz concept is the name given to the recommendations resulting from a commission on reforms to the German labour market in 2002. Named after the head of the commission, Peter Hartz, it went on to become part of the German government\\'s Agenda 2010 series of reforms, known as Hartz I - Hartz IV. The reforms of Hartz I - III took place between January 1, 2003 and 2004; Hartz IV began on January 1, 2005.\\nOn February 22, 2002, the \"Hartz Commission\" was founded; its real name was die Kommission für moderne Dienstleistungen am Arbeitsmarkt - the Commission for Modern Services on the Labour Market. Its 15 members were led by Peter Hartz, then Volkswagen\\'s personnel director.\\nThe commission came up with thirteen \"innovation modules\" suggesting changes to the German labour market system. These were then put into practice as Hartz I - IV.\\nIn January 2005, Germany\\'s unemployment rate - as predicted in advance by many observers - rose instead of falling. As suggested above, this rise was not due to any sudden and rapid deterioration in Germany\\'s economic situation. Rather it was due to a kind of statistical effect, and in part, as the unemployment figures come down and down in Germany we are seeing some sort of \"obverse\" reflection of this statistical effect, and this is why the data needs to be treated with so much caution, especially given the role which inflation wage push concerns in Germany - via the good offices of the Bundesbank - are playing in policy making at the ECB at present. Indeed, ECB President Jean Claude Trichet specifically singled out German postal workers when he indicated his ongoing intentions to exercise inflation vigilance rather than monetary loosening in the face of the eurozone\\'s growing economic headwinds.\\nUnder the new legislation introduced in that month, all people deemed capable of work but without a job found themselves with the obligation of registering as unemployed with the Federal Labour Offices. This marked a change since previously such registration had not been necessary for recipients of social assistance (and the whole issue of registration or non-registration lies at the heart of the methodological disputes about German unemployment). When the Hartz concept was introduced the Institute for Employment Research (In-stitut für Arbeitsmarkt- und Berufsforschung (IAB)), the Federal Employment Services\\' research institution, forecast the number of people affected by this measure would be approximately 300,000. In reality the problem proved to be even worse than the forecast, since in January 2005 the Federal Employment Service announced the unemployment figure to stand at 5,037,000, an increase of over half a million on the December 2004 number (with roughtly 225,000 of these being attributable to the Hartz reform).\\nNow one of the key features of the reform concerned unemployment benefit, since entitlement to maximum benefits was considerably reduced. Starting on January 1st 2004 the maximum period of entitlement to such benefit was reduced to 32 months as a transitional measure. But for new claims presented after January 31st 2006 the entitlement generally lasts for a maximum of 12 months, and for persons older than 55, for a maximum of 18 months. A very simple calculation should show us that for anyone registered on 1st January 2004, benefit will have run out around September 2006. I think we are lead to the unescapable conclusion that some portion of the frenetic rise in the German employment levels of late is a by-product of the increasing number of people who are facing the imminent prospect of having their benefit terminated. This could also be a factor in squaring why all the extra employment, far from producing optimism, is leading to a growing feeling of pessimism in the consumer sentiment indexes. Especially given the nature of much of the employment being created (see below) and the general economic conjuncture in which Germany finds itself.\\nThe high withdrawal rates for additional income earned while unemployed - which Hartz introduced - have been and still are a crucial problem. The problem hangs around the difficulty that - by differentiating between income from a regular job on the first labour market on which the high withdrawal rates have to be applied - and income from doing community services (so called 1-Euro-jobs, see below) for which lower rates hold, a bias towards jobs in the second labour market has been enforced. This of course is part of the intention.\\nMany voices have been raised in Germany to argue that with the introduction of class II unemployment benefit a kind of \"wage dumping\" process was initiated since the unemployed people were effectively forced to accept any job no matter the wage, solely to keep their benefits. The fact that one of the results of the introduction of the Haryz concept is that more people work in jobs with low incomes seems to me to be undeniable. This is exactly what the reform aims for: the creation of a low wage sector in which people with low-skills, who have been disproportionately unemployed, can find a job. A quite separate question revolves around why there are so many low skilled persons in Germany, and around the macro economic consequences of a structural increase in such forms of employment, and these will to some extent be addressed below.\\nBefore moving on to this we might note in passing that it is far from surprising that Hartz has lead directly into the current debate about whether or not it is desireable to establish a statutory minimum wage in Germany, since I feel many of the people who endorsed Hartz never really understood what the underlying issue was, nor why Germany\\'s economic performance was giving the results it was. Of course, as far as the present argument goes, what needs to be born in mind is that such a minimum wage would in fact conflict with the core objectives of the Hartz social and labour market reform and in this sense would be counterproductive, since precisely the kinds of work which is now being created would disappear, and the consequence would be that the people concerned went back to unemployment rather than the creation of a larger number of better paid jobs.\\nOne Euro Jobs?\\nThe so called One-Euro-Jobs – the official name is MAE (Mehraufwandsentschädigung, compensation for additional effort) - are forms of community-related employment available to the unemployed at very low salaries (hence the \"one euro\" label), sufficiently low as to not imply the total loss of benefit. The underlying philosophy is that they should be thought of as a graduated step into work. In fact recipients of type II unemployment benefit are virtually obliged to accept such jobs or face benefit curtailments. Rejection is normally followed by benefit cuts (in the first instance by 30 percent, but repeated refusals ultimately lead to a statutory minimum of rent plus food stamps). In Berlin, One-Euro workers get 1,50 Euro an hour (although sometimes this may be as low as 1,20 Euro). Normally such workers work 30 hours per week. They are entitled to earn around 180 Euros MAE on top of Alg2 (Type II benefit) plus rent. The One-Euro agencies or contractors get 500 Euros per month for each MAE job (for management expenses and qualification efforts).\\nIt is a legal requirement that the One-Euro-Job is “additional”, i.e. such employment should not put regular jobs at risk. One-Euro-Jobs do not constitute an employment contract so employment rights (like sick pay, holiday pay or the right to go on strike) do not apply (hence the low levels of social security registration being noted, see below).\\nIn Germany a total of 176.000 MAE jobs had been created by the middle of 2005. I have no recent data on MAE jobs, so if anyone reading this can update me, I would be grateful. One thing which immediately becomes clear to me at this point is the large difference which exists between Germany and Southern European countries like Spain and Italy in this regard, since in Southern Europe the MAE type jobs are being systematically filled by new migrants (care for the aged would be the obvious example here), while in Germany it is the native born population which is being moved over into such activities, this seems to fit in with the general picture we have been receiving from Research organisations like the Lisbon Council about the poor quality of much of the human capital which Germany faces going forward, and some of the difficulties this represents in the context of a rapidly ageing society.\\nWhere we are now?\\nThe first thing to recognise is - whatever data interpretation issues we may have - the Hartz reforms have resulted in a real decline in unemployment, and a significant increase in the volume of new jobs created. According to first provisional calculations of the Federal Statistical Office , the number of people in employment in Germany in 2007 averaged 39.7 million. This represented an increase of 649,000 people employed or a rise of 1.7% over the 2006 number. So the increase in employment is real enough. This increase follows a rise of 242,000 persons (or +0.6%) on 2005, so the rate of increase accelerated, and the average number of persons in employment reached its highest level since German reunification.\\nThe problem we have, and this is the point of all the rigmorole I have gone into above, is in deciding - from a macroeconomic viewpoint - what significance can be attach to this process? Certainly there is a fiscal impact, and this we are seeing, as part of the burden of supporting the poorer sections of German society falls on the citizens themselves. This is clearly a net plus.\\nAlso it is important to note that the average increase in employment in 2007 was largely driven by an increase in the number of employees, which rose by 595,000 persons (+1.7%) to just under 35.3 million compared to the previous year. Hence the number of employees was only slightly below the all-time high registered in 2001 (35.3 million, but note the date here, as it is significant, as we will see below). The positive effects of the reform and Germany\\'s economic expansion also had an impact on the number of jobs subject to social insurance contributions, which after falling for several years, once more started to increase in 2006:\\nHowever we should note that, as a proportion of total employment, these social security covered jobs have been declining steadily, year by year (and indeed during 2007 the percentage has remained very near the 2006 level of 67.5% according to my own very rough and ready calculations). So what we are seeing is a very large increase in temporary, part time, or other more fragile forms of employment, which, welcome as it is, needs to be but into perspective if we are to think about the robsutness of the German recovery, and the ability of domestic consumption to sustain economic growth at some point in the future.\\nWe also know that the number of German workers in part time jobs has been rising steadily as a percentage of the total workforce (see chart below).\\nHuman Capital and OutSourcing\\nNow another way of looking at this whole situation is to ask what exactly is happening to Germany\\'s human capital stock at the present time. It is evident that in the context of ongoing demographic shifts developing and maintaining the human capital is going to play a key role in determining future economic prosperity. Germany\\'s median age is rising, and is projected to rise, quite rapidly, much more rapidly, say, than that of France.\\nAt the same time the key 25 to 49 age group reached its maximimum weighting as a proportion of the total population back in the mid 1990s, and is now falling.\\nMeanwhile at the extremes - the oldest and the youngest ages, the paths completely diverge, as the proportion of the young population declines and the proportion of the older groups increases. The important thing to realise is that this change is permanent, it is not simply the passing through of a \"baby boom\", and German society needs to make long term changes to adjust to this reality.\\nIn the above chart - which shows the relative changes between the 0 to 14 and the 65 to 79 populations, I have intentionally not made use of any of the future projections, since I want to emphasise that the argument we are persuing on this blog is that these age structural changes are having a real impact in the here and now, and not something which might hypothetically happen 30 or 50 years from now.\\nHuman Capital Index\\nPrecisely in order to address this sort of concern, and in an attempy to try to measure the development of human capital in European Union member states the Lisbon Council and Deutschland Denken! have created the European Human Capital Index - a ranking index of 13 the European Union member states. You can find the various editions of the index on this page here.\\nEssentially the index looks at each country\\'s ability to develop and deploy its human capital resources. This is important since one of the core explanations as to why the population ageing process can take place in a reasonably painless fashion is that leveraging human capital resources can help less people be as effective economically as more people were previously (ie the economy can still grow even with a reducing workforce). This is one of those ideas which sounds awfully good on paper, but may turn out to be much more complicated to apply in practice, and one of the reasons for writing this lengthy post and thinking about this so much is that in those countries most directly affected at the present time - Germany, Japan and Italy - we seem to be observing not the promised surge in the quality of the aggregate human capital deployed, but rather a steady decline, and in particular as reflected in the wages and salaries paid as the median age rises. Indeed, it is rather noteworthy in this connection to note that as the speed of the expansion in Germany slows (January 2008), record numbers of employees are still being added to the labour force.\\nIn order to try to carry out a quantitative comparison between countries the Lisbon Council defined human capital as the cost of formal and informal education - as expressed in euros - and multiplied this result by the number of people living in each country. They also adjusted their calculations to take account of ongoing demographic developments, provisioning for the loss of human capital due to declining workforces and shifting population patterns across the EU countries. What they found in their 2006 edition was as follows:\\nSome countries – notably Germany and Italy – are courting disaster by allowingtheir human capital to stagnate through high workforce exclusion andchronic underinvestment in education an training. Unless reversed, these trends will lead to a deterioration of human capital in those countries – countries which traditionally served as the engine of European economic success. That, in turn, will have devastating economic consequences for the citizens of those countries which can already be forecast today. For example, if current trends are not reversed, the citizens of Germany and Italy could find themselves with up to 50% lower gross domestic product per head (a standard measure of basic prosperity) than people in Sweden, Ireland or the United Kingdom by 2030 – an historic reversal of Europe’s traditional pattern of economic distribution, brought on in no small part by the poverty of contemporary policies towards human capital in those countries.\\nIn fact Sweden topped the European Human Capital Index in 2006, while Germany and the Mediterranean countries marked the bottom (Germany was in tenth place out of thirteen, just above Portugal, Spain and Italy, in that order). Indeed the study found that high-skill immigrants tend to go to countries that are prosperous and offer attractive job opportunities.\\nAs growth and wealth diverge, highly-skilled citizens from stagnating economies are unlikely to merely watch their standard of living decline relative to their European neighbours. German doctors working in the Nordic economies, or London’s pull on financial-service workers, are examples of a phenomenon that is likely to become more widespread – with ultimately negative consequences for countries that are unable to attract and retain their best and brightest workers. This migration of highly-skilled labour will amplify economic divergence, reducing economic growth further in the economies at the bottom of the table and enhancing the position of those at the top.\\nHuman Capital Utilization\\nThe Lisbon Council also found significant divergence in degrees of human capital utilisation across the European Union, with levels varying from those encountered in Italy - where a scoreof only 52% was registered - to the Netherlands - where the equivalent level was 64%. However they found that this gap had been reducing, since the spread had previously been even wider, with some countries at one point utilising only 40% of their available human capital.\\nThey found that, over the last two decades, Human Capital Utilisation across the EU had risen to 58%, up from the earlier average of 50%. During that time, three countries were found to have exhibited particularly stellar performances, rising from the bottom all the way to the top – the Netherlands, Spain and Ireland.\\nAt the other extreme the worst performer was found to have been Germany, where they found that Human Capital Utilisation had actually fallen or stagnated. As shown in the charts above, as populations more and more human capital is vested in the over 60s. If current retirement patterns do not change, the average level of German Human Capital Utilisation will fall to 52% by 2030 based on current demographic trends. If this happens, it will roll back and reverse all of the achievements in effective Human Capital Utilisation made over the last 20 years. This is why what is happening in Germany\\'s labour market at the present time is so important.\\nAnd the point is that retirement patterns are changing, and more and more people over 60 are going to work - in Germany, Japan and Italy - but the kinds of jobs they are doing are generally ones with a much lower value content than those they did when they were under 55, and this is what is being reflected in the very weak upward movement in aggregate wages and salaries in these countries of late.\\nThe employment rate of older workers (as shown in the chart above) is calculated by dividing the number of persons aged 55 to 64 in employment by the total population of the same age group. This age - while still not especially high for Germany - has been rising steadily of late, as has the average age of exit from the labour force (see chart below).\\nThe magnitude of the demographic trends we are looking at varies greatly from one country to another across Europe. France, Ireland and Sweden, for example, have been able to maintain their birth rates around or near to replacement levels. In Germany and Italy, on the other hand, fertility has been unable to break out of the 1.3 tfr zone, and has been at very low leves for decades now, hence all the available alarm bells should be ringing. If current employment and immigration patterns continue, the thirteen countries analyzed in the European Human Capital Index will lose 12.4 million employees by the year 2030, a loss of close to 8% of the workforce. Of these, Germany will lose 5.2 million and Italy 3.5 million employees, jointly accounting for an incredible 70% of the total European drop. In Germany, the shortfall will be equivalent to about six age cohorts that should be working instead of retiring – or in other words the average effective retirement age would have to move to 66 by 2030, up from 60 today, in order to neutralize the demographic change. In Italy the shortfall is closer to seven age cohorts, and the effective retirementage would have to rise to 68 in 2030, up from 61 today.\\nBut of course even as the proportion of people over 60 is going up, what we are seeing is that the economic value of their contribution is going down. So the very big question is really why this is happening? Why is Germany\\'s human capital so evidently in jeopardy, just at the time when the German economy appears to be performing so exceptionally well in terms of new job creation. And in particular why is it that Germany is producing so many low-skill jobs at just the time when skill shortages in the higher value work seem to be presenting themselves on an ever increasing basis.\\nAnd again all of this takes on some importance in the context of the present debate about the dangers of wage push inflation as Germany\\'s labour market tightens. If we look at the chart for total wage costs, we can see these have been pretty weak over quite an extended period of time now.\\nBut if we come to look at the path of total wages over the last 12 months we will find that one important reason why German wage costs have remained so flat even while unemployment has declined has been that total wage cost increases have been offset to some extent by a one-off reduction in non-wage costs, but this is coming to an end as we enter 2008, which is one reason why all the parties concerned are extremely nervous.\\nIn December 2007 the Bitkom industry association - which includes industry \"heavyweights\" like Deutsche Telekom, Microsoft Germany and SAP - produced a report which argued that two-thirds of German high-tech firms consider that their operations are being hampered by a lack of IT experts.\\nIndeed, we are faced with the curious anomaly that even though some 3.8 million Germans remain unemployed, the country\\'s recent growth spurt has left businesses unable to fill an estimated 600,000 vacancies, including many high-skilled jobs, according to research last year by the IW economic institute in Cologne. Among these missing skilled workers are some 48,000 engineers, whose absence the Institute estimates cost Germany last year about €3.5 billion in lost output.\\nWell part of the answer to our question is possibly to be found in some recent research carried out by the Munich-based economist Dalia Marin. In a paper entitled \"Is Human Capital Losing from Outsourcing? Evidence for Austria and Poland\", Marin and her colleagues argue that:\\n\"multinational firms in Austria and Germany are outsourcing the most skill intensive activities to Eastern Europe taking advantage of cheap abundant skilled labor in Eastern Europe. We find that the firms’ outsourcing activities to Eastern Europe are a response to a human capital scarcity in Austria and Germany which has become particularly severe in the 1990s.\"\\n(see detailed link and full references at the foot of this post, together with details of other related material - including a link to the PhD thesis of Marin\\'s student Alexander Raubold, on which much of the resulting research seems to be based).\\nNow this finding when I discovered it some months ago really rather surprised me, although perhaps, with hindsight it shouldn\\'t have. I had imagined, like many others doubtless also do, that Germany and Austria were outsourcing primarily unskilled, or lower skilled work (this is, for example, the situation in Sweden, see the Becker et al paper referenced below). But then reflecting a little on simple economic theory, and taking on board the fact that both Austria and Germany are now suffering relative shortages of young people, and the huge differential in skilled wages which exist between East and West , then it may well make sound economic sense for German and Austrian companies to employ relatively more intensive quantities (in terms of labour-capital ratios) of relatively cheap skilled labour in the East, and this does seem to be what has been happening.\\nCorporations’ outsourcing of skill intensive firm activity to Eastern Europe has helped to ease the human capital crisis in both countries. We find that high skilled jobs transferred to Eastern Europe account for 10 percent of Germany’s and 48 percent of Austria’s supply of university graduates in the 1990s.\\nThe Austrian number seems really enormous, the German one less so, but it is still important. In addition Marin produces data which shows that German affiliates in the accession countries were paying (prior to 2004) 17 percent of their German parent wages but had been able to increase their productivity to 60 percent of the parents’ productivity level. Simple mathematics therefore suggests that they were able to reduce the labor costs by some 70 odd percent relative to their parent-firm cost in Germany.\\nOn examining the pattern of multinational investment and outsourcing across sectors Marin found that German investment was predominantly engaged in manufacturing activity in Eastern Europe (almost 60 percent of total investment), of which manufactured goods and machinery and transport are the most important sectors. She also found that some 90 percent of German investment in machinery and transport were outsourcing (rather than local market oriented) investments.\\nMarin then went on to look at the levels of skill intensity for outsourced work and asked just how skill intensive the activity undertaken by German affiliates in Eastern Europe actually was when compared to their parent firm activity in Germany. She used two indicators to measure the skill intensity of German affiliates in Eastern Europe:\\na) the share of workers with a university or college degree and\\nb) the share of personnel engaged in R&D or engineering activities in the manufacturing and service sector.\\nThe data she studied suggest that the high-skill ratios of affiliates (the number of university or college workers in percent of total affiliate workers) are 2 to 3 times as large as that of German parent firms in the Eastern Accession Countries. The share of university or college graduates among affiliate workers in Eastern Europe was found to vary between a high of 86 percent (Czech Republic) and low of 8 percent (Slovenia).\\nThe most skill intensive activity was being undertaken by affiliates in the Czech Republic (with a skill share of 86 percent), and Slovakia (skill share of 40 percent). This compares with an average share of university or college graduates of German parent firms of 18 percent only. Thus, measured by the number of university and college graduates, German affiliates in Bulgaria were found to be 12 times as skill intensive than their German parent firms, and affiliates in the Czech Republic 5.5 times as skill intensive. Only affiliates in Hungary were found to have a skill share below that of German parent firms.\\nA similar picture emerged when she looked at the skill intensity of German affiliates as measured by the share of workers engaged in R&D and engineering. The R&D personnel ratios of affiliates in Eastern Europe ranged between 4.0 percent (Slovakia) and 27.8 percent (Croatia and Russia). This compared with an average R&D personnel share of 13.6 percent of German parent firms. Thus, German affiliates in the Czech Republic are 1.7 times as R&D intensive as their German parent firms.\\nThese are striking and puzzling numbers. German and Austrian multinationals tend to outsource the most skill and R&D intensive activities to Eastern Europe. Why is this happening? Well according to Marin:\\nEconomic theory guides us to look at the factor endowment of these countries for an answer. If countries outsource the most skill intensive activities to other countries, then these countries must be poorly endowed with skills relative to their trading partners.When Germany and Austria’s endowment with skills is compared to Eastern Europe.....we find.....the Baltic States, Russia, Hungary, and Bulgaria are the most skill rich countries as measured by the share of the labor force with a tertiary education level. Germany’s education level lies below the OECD average and roughly matches that of the accession countries average. In particular, Germany is less skill rich than the Baltic States, Russia, and Hungary. In this ranking of countries Austria turns out to be the most skill poor country.\\nIn order to examine Marin\\'s thesis a little for my own satisfaction I thought it might be interesting to examine the services trade balance situation in the EU 10 economies. As is relatively well known most of these economies run a much stronger position on their services trade than they do on their goods trade. In order to examine this I broke the EU 10 down into two groups. A first group - Poland, Hungary, Estonia, the Czech Republicand Slovenia, who as can be seen are all doing reasonably well (these are absolute not proortional values - millions of euros - so it is the slope not the level of the line that matters). Poland is doing particularly well, which must be seen as some sort of indication of the quality of the human capital which it still has available at this point (remember, many of these countries can themselves soon face the problems which Germany now faces due to demographic ageing as the reserves are steadily used up).\\nThen we have a second group - Slovakia, Romania, Lithuania, Latvia, Bulgaria - which do far less well. Bulgaria - as Marin found - seems to have a lot of potential, but the data fluctuates cyclically, although the general ine is clearly up. Romania seems to do the worst, but none of the other three are particularly impressive. In general, of course, this data is far more interesting for what it reveals about the mid term underlying structural dynamics of the EU10, but it also does give an interesting picture of what is actually happening right now.\\nAnd especially when we come to look at the negative goods trade balance position of these countries (with the exception of Hungary - which now of course has an internal demand recession - and the Czech Republic).\\nObviously, looking at the strong downward line for Romania, we have a clear warning of what is about to come in that country, but this is not our point of interest here. What we can see is that these countries are to some extent (given the importance of Germany in their overall trade) importing finished manufactured products from Germany and paying for these with service exports. This to a considerable extent reverses the normal trading dynamic between developed and emerging economies, and is why Marin described - in a cryptic reference to the tarde links between Mexico and the USA - what was happening as being Maquiladoras in reverse (Maquiladoras are affiliates of US multinationals in Mexico which specialize in the low skill intensive part of the value chain).\\nSo what conclusions can we draw from all of this. Well arguably not the sort of standard ones you will find in the Economist or Bloomberg, or the Financial Times.\\nThe data is the latest evidence that the German economy has proven resilient despite strong economic headwinds, defying the global financial market turbulences and credit squeeze, the sharp rise in the euro, rising raw materials and energy prices, and the marked US slowdown.\\nConclusion, Have We Been Here Before?\\nTo close, a few more charts. We can see from the most recent export y-o-y chart that export growth is now slowing significantly (see below), and that we are now entering the downward phase of the whole cycle.\\nWe have, of course, been here before, after the collapse of the internet boom, so it may be worth reminding ourselves at this point what ectually happened last time round, ie the last time the acceleration in the Y-o-Y growth rates in German exports effectively stalled. That was back in early 2000, as we can see from the chart below. And what happened at that next? Well the fed was easing as the US entered recession, and the euro was to some extent rising, both of which put a strong break on German exports. And after export growth collapsed, German GDP growth wasn\\'t far behind. So it isn\\'t the rise in the currency alone that matters, you have to think about the whole environment which produces it. Why your currency is rising, while someone else\\'s is falling. And of course, in German export terms, after the rise comes the fall. This is the cost of not being able to depend on your own internal demand, you have to depend on someone else\\'s demand.\\nSecondly, we should also think about what happens to employment creation and unemployment as GDP growth stalls. The chart below offers a comparison of movements in the two main unemployment indicators for Germany - the ILO comparable one, and the national German one - from the early 1990s to date. As can be seen the stall in GDP growth produced the rapid rise in umeployment after the summer of 2000, as win-win became lose-lose. I don\\'t see why the picture shoud be that different this time round. The ageing population component in the slowdown will - if anything - be worse this time (the median age is higher). The labour market arguments are outlined in much more depth in this post.\\nTwo Documents I have found particularly useful in preparing this post are:\\nRevision of the monthly harmonised unemployment figures for Germany, Eurostat, European Commission, 2007.\\nHartz IV – The German “Word of the Year 2004” and the Country’s Hope to overcome its Problem of Unemployment, Tim Lohse, University of Hanover Discussion Paper, February 2005.\\nThe Wikipedia entry on The Hartz Concept is also reasonably informative.\\nThe Federal Statistics Office page on the ILO Methodology\\nILO Seasonally Adjusted Unemployment Statistics as presented by the Federal Labour Office.\\nSome explanation of the ILO methodology implications According to the can also be found from the Federal Statistics Bureau here.\\nWhat Explains Germany’s Rebounding Export Market Share?\\nStephan Danninger and Fred Joutz\\nIMF working paper WP/07/24\\nOverall Development in Foreign Trade 1950 - 2006.

HOWARD BERMAN (D, CA-28): Integrating India into a global nonproliferation regime is a positive step. Before anyone gets too sanctimonious about India\\'s nuclear weapons program, we should acknowledge that the five recognized nuclear weapons states have not done nearly enough to fulfill their commitments under the Nuclear\\nNonproliferation Treaty, including making serious reductions in their own arsenals, nor in the case of the US in ratifying the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.\\nOpponent\\'s argument to vote No:Rep. BARBARA LEE (D, CA-9): In withholding my approval, I seek not to penalize the people of India but, rather, to affirm the principle of nuclear nonproliferation. Jettisoning adherence to the international nuclear nonproliferation framework that has served the world so well for more than 30 years, as approval of the agreement before us would do, is just simply unwise. It is also reckless.\\nApproval of this agreement undermines our efforts to dissuade countries like Iran and North Korea from developing nuclear weapons. By approving this agreement, all we are doing is creating incentives for other countries to withdraw from the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.\\nReference: US-India Nuclear Agreement;\\n; vote number 2008-S211\\non Oct 1, 2008\\nVoted YES on killing a bill for trade sanctions if China sells weapons.\\nVote to table [kill] an amendment that would require sanctions against China or other countries if they were found to be selling illicit weapons of mass destruction.\\n; vote number 2000-242\\non Sep 13, 2000\\nVoted NO on capping foreign aid at only $12.7 billion.\\nAdoption of the conference report on the 2000 Foreign Operations Appropriations Bill provided $12.7 billion for foreign aid programs in 2000.\\nVetoed by President ClintonVeto message of 10/18/1999: W cannot protect American interests at home without active engagement abroad. We must lead in the world, working with other nations to defuse crises, repel dangers, promote more open economic and political systems, and strengthen the rule of law. This bill rejects all of those principles.\\nThe overall funding provided by H.R. 2606 is inadequate. By denying America a decent investment in diplomacy, this bill suggests we should meet threats to our security with our military might alone. That is a dangerous proposition. For if we underfund our diplomacy, we will end up overusing our military.\\nFor example, A generation from now, no one is going to say we did too much to help the nations of the former Soviet Union safeguard their nuclear technology and expertise.

DURBIN: The definition of \"genocide\" is \"the deliberate and systematic extermination of a national, racial, political, or cultural group.\" Scholars agree that what the Armenian people suffered in 1915 to 1917 fits the definition of genocide. To date, 19 countries and 37 US states recognize the Armenian Genocide. Genocide is wrong. It is evil. It is evil whether its victims are Armenians, Sudanese, Rwandan Tutsis, Cambodians or European Jews. Not to acknowledge genocide for what it is denigrates the memory of its victims. Recognition of genocide is part of the healing process. Official recognition will reaffirm our tradition of protecting the vulnerable and inspire us to not stand by and watch as genocide occurs in our time.\\nSource: Armenian Genocide Resolution (S.RES.106/H.RES.106) 2007-SR106 on Mar 14, 2007\\n- WHEREAS the Armenian Genocide was conceived and carried out by the Ottoman Empire from 1915 to 1923, resulting in the deportation of nearly 2,000,000 Armenians, of whom 1,500,000 men, women, and children were killed, and which succeeded in the elimination of more than 2,500-year presence of Armenians in their historic homeland;\\n- WHEREAS, on May 24, 1915, the Allied Powers issued the joint statement of England, France, and Russia that explicitly charged, for the first time ever, another government of committing \"a crime against humanity\";\\n- WHEREAS, despite the international recognition of the Armenian Genocide, the failure of the domestic and international authorities to punish those responsible for the Armenian Genocide is a reason why similar genocides have recurred and may recur in the future, and that a just resolution will help prevent future genocides:\\n- NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED, that the Senate calls on the President, in the\\nPresident\\'s annual message commemorating the Armenian Genocide, to accurately characterize the systematic annihilation of 1,500,000 Armenians as genocide and to recall the proud history of US intervention in opposition to the Armenian Genocide.\\nCondemn violence by Chinese government in Tibet.\\nLautenberg co-sponsored condemning the violence by Chinese government in Tibet\\nA resolution condemning the violence in Tibet and calling for restraint by the Government of the People\\'s Republic of China and the people of Tibet.

       " {'text': \"Welcome to My Site — This is the third incarnation of the Scissors & Paste website, and is once again, hopefully, an improvement on its predecessors, at least in design. Much of the credit for this must go to the long-suffering Sheryl Straight, whose patient advice, particularly on the mysteries of Cascading Style Sheets, has been invaluable.\\nA New Publication — I am delighted to announce, but sorry not have done so earlier, the appearance of a major new bibliography of erotica, Jean-Louis Guereña's excellent Un Infierno Español. Un Ensayo de Bibliografia de publicaciones eróticas Españolas Clandestinas 1812–1939 (Madrid: Asociación de Libreros Viejo , 2011). So far as I am aware, this is the first attempt to systematically describe erotic and pornographic literature published in the Spanish language, and certainly deserves its place beside the other recent works of such authorities and Peter Mendes and Jean-Pierre Dutel whose bibliographies of the erotica of England and France respectively have proved so valuable to those of us whose fancies lie in that direction. It is to be regretted that Sr. Guereña's book is not more easily available outside Spain, but copies may be obtained through the ABE website. Prices vary, but are in general more than reasonable for a work so admirably researched and attractively printed. For a larger view of the front wrapper, please click the illustration of it above.\\nOld books Future Plans — I am, as always, casting about for new projects to publish on this site, not an easy task. One that has been completed is a bibliography of the clandestines of Jean-Jacques Pauvert, inevitably a rather short compilation since unlike his contemporary, the late Eric Losfeld, Pauvert seemed uncomfortable publishing secretly and more interested in challenging French censorship head-on. Notes towards a listing of the works of the prolific Alphonse Momas ['Fuckwell,' 'Le Nismois,' &c] have also been posted.\\nAdditions & updates — Since this site's been up, I've made a good many changes. Some have not been obvious–the addition of a new work or addition to a catalogue, or the silent correction of blunders when they pointed out to me. Observant visitors, however, may have noticed a sudden sprinkling of 'new' and one 'updated' labels, and I have indeed been busy accumulating new material. Some is of marginal interest, erotically speaking, such as the reprint of Henry Spencer Ashbee's short account of a trip that he made to Coney Island in the 1880s, but I am happy with the pages devoted to John Stephen Farmer, the noted lexicographer, and the greatly expanded catalogue of the contents of the British Library's 'Supressed Safe' collection of books locked away for libel or other reasons. The augmentation of this latter was so great that I was obliged to put it up on my site as a .pdf file. The J.S. Farmer page grew out of the discovery of some curious information concerning his private life; the research wasn't mine alone, but I felt it was of sufficient interest to add as part of the preliminary matter to a short-title catalogue of his publications.\",\n",

       " {'text': 'In about 2 weeks there will be a great webinar panel discussion on the business and technology architecture concerns in automating your cloud and how to measure the value. Unleashing automation solutions to do what they do best may make or break a company’s IT strategy over the next few quarters as those cloud journeys begin.\\nThe webinar,IT Automation Unplugged, a panel discussion moderated by Glenn O’Donnell of Forrester will indeed be a cool event to listen in to. Not only has Glenn followed this space for many years but he also has some really insightful perspectives on the Journey to Cloud. This webinar has the potential to highlight some really pointed dialog between myself and Brad Adams of rPath, Nand Mulchandani of ScaleXtreme, and Luke Kanies of Puppetlabs. I bet the sparks might fly as we trade our perspectives on the huge demand for private and public clouds and need for enterprises to show value quickly.\\nThis brings me to a great phrase I heard this week from one of our customers. It was used in the context of their employees using their company’s private cloud. It was “High Governance”. It was seriously lacking in their current solution which highly leveraged their virtualization vendor’s software. I probed them on what they meant by “High Governance”. It was mostly around ensuring that individuals that provision services would get access to only the services, cloud data center locations, and specific providers that they are entitled to. While this is not a new concept, the element that grabbed my attention was that IT shops have a strong need for different sourcing strategies based upon end user role, organization, location, and any number of policy settings in their Active Directory or LDAP.\\n“High Governance” means ensuring that your cloud users get ONLY what they are entitled to in your IT policy. No more generic UIs for generic users or uber UIs for unknown hypothetical users. The cloud is now a strongly governed personal experience, what a novel concept.\\nI wonder what the panel will think about this. Please attend if you get a chance.\\nRecently, I participated in a conversation with our LinkedIn community on GETideas.org. The crux of the discussion was labels--should there be a universal taxonomy for terms such as Global Education, and would trying to foster global adoption of such terms speed up the transformation of the societal challenges we face today? It got me thinking about all sorts of terms that pop into our language stream. One day you’re talking about the “inequalities of the distribution of wealth and the effects of taxation on global markets;” the next day you’re texting an associate and summing up your thought stream with the word “Occupy”.\\nIn my preparation for a panel discussion called Why enterprise Social Media Loves Social Good?, I poked around online to see if there was any consistency in the meaning for the term “social good”. Almost all the discussions and posts I found connected “social good” directly to its use within the business community. While businesses vary in their approaches to social good, this definition seems to be a common one: “A good or service that benefits the largest number of people in the largest possible way. Some classic examples of social goods are clean air, clean water and literacy; in addition, many economic proponents include access to services such as healthcare in their definition of the social or “common good”. (Source: http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/social_good.asp) Read More »\\nI just finished an interview on the topic of “Cloud in Manufacturing” with a German machine-building and factory automation magazine. The interview ran an hour longer than scheduled—an indication of the publication’s interest, as well as its lingering doubts about whether cloud services truly can benefit “real manufacturing.”\\nWe discussed an abundance of cloud-related ideas – most pertaining to obvious areas such as web presence in marketing, after-sales application hosting to make field engineers more productive, and collaboration as a service to enable partners and suppliers to work together more effectively on large projects.\\nThe uncharted cloud territory, however, is the area that manufacturers see their “core”: the physical making of things. Can cloud play a role in supply chain management (yes, it can)? Will there be a cloud service for motion control (due to latency and determinism considerations, not yet) and for asset management and MIS applications (yes)?

It’s our seventh and it covers our CSR efforts in the areas of governance and ethics, value chain, our people, society, and the environment.\\nSince the founding of our longest-running CSR program, the Cisco Networking Academy in 1997, our efforts have been authentically grown from the inside out with enthusiastic support from our employees. We believe technology is a powerful tool that can not only help our customers thrive, but bring people together to transform lives, build communities and preserve the environment.\\nBefore you stifle a yawn, consider this: Sound records and information management means that employees up and down the corporate ladder follow consistent policies and procedures. This translates into strict compliance with laws and regulations and contributes to overall organizational success. And it gives shareholders, customers, regulators, and employees confidence.

       " {'text': 'Doulas and Homebirth\\nCompiled by Molly Remer\\nThe decision to hire a doula is a personal one, regardless of in which setting you give birth. My first baby was born at a birth center with the presence of a midwife, a doctor, my doula, a friend, my mother, and my husband. In hindsight, I felt like it had been too many people and that the doula hadn’t really been needed. For my second birth, at home, it was extremely important to me to have as few people present as possible. My husband, my mom, and my son greeted the arrival of my second son. My midwife arrived five minutes before his birth—just in time to catch! My midwife for this birth was so amazing, that I didn’t feel the need for any other professional care. I still miss her! For my third birth also at home, this time a second trimester miscarriage with only my husband present, I really wished I had a doula there for emotional support and supportive physical care tasks (not medical support, but tea bringing and towel washing). And, finally, with my last baby, while I liked and respected my midwife I didn\\'t have the same warm bond with her and really wanted to hire a doula, precisely because I was missing some of the emotional component I value so highly in midwifery care. It is really the little things that make doula care so special. In the included photo my doula (FoMM President, Summer!) puts warm socks on me after my baby’s January birth.\\nDespite my own range of personal experiences, when calling for contributions for this article, I still anticipated receiving a number of responses suggesting that doulas at homebirth are unnecessary, or redundant. After all, an emotional connection and secure trust is often the hallmark of what differentiates the midwifery model from the medical model. However, the responses I received were overwhelmingly in favor of hiring a doula for a homebirth.\\nFinding inner power instead of crumbling in pain\\nAs I eagerly awaited my homebirth, I never considered getting a doula. I had two midwives assisting me, so I figured that would be enough, wasn’t that the same thing anyway? When labor hit in the middle of the night I could hardly function, I was in so much pain. Everything I learned in childbirth class went right out the window, and the same thing happened for my husband when it came to trying to help me. One of my midwives didn’t show up for a few more hours, so I was alone struggling with my blinding pain that whole time. Once she did arrive, and started walking me through my contractions, it made a world of difference. My homebirth ended up turning into a hospital transfer due to decelerations in my baby’s heartbeat during every contraction, and a doula was called out to stay with us while our midwives couldn’t. I don’t know what I would have done without her… Having to transfer to the hospital was a very scary experience, and when my much hoped-for homebirth turned into a much dreaded c-section, my doula was there as a voice of reason as well as much-needed emotional support. Looking back on the whole turn of events, I’m so grateful she was there and I have a whole new outlook on the work of a doula. There’s no way I’ll go through labor without one again. I had to get an epidural for the c-section, and that turned out to be the most terrible, painful part of the whole experience – much worse than labor by a long shot. Ever since my experience, I’ve been encouraging all of my friends to hire a doula for their births, whether they choose to go to a hospital or not. If they want a sure shot at avoiding drugs, a doula is the way to go at a hospital. And it makes sense at a hospital, but why would a home birth mom consider a doula? There aren’t any drugs or negatively persuasive doctors or medical staff to avoid there, and isn’t that the biggest reason to have a doula? I thought so, anyway. But doulas offer much more than a voice of reason against pressuring medical personnel. They help you find your inner power when you could easily crumble under the pain of labor. They erase fear that can easily find its way into your mind if you’re laboring without support. And, speaking from personal experience, they change labor from “painful” to “empowering”, turning it into the beautiful, positive experience it should be – you’re bringing a baby into the world! Something so wonderful shouldn’t be tagged with such a negative word as “painful”, and doulas make that possible. Labor is labor, no matter what your location is when you’re experiencing it, and having a doula there during it makes a huge difference.\\nA lasting legacy\\nMandy writes: Hanging on my fridge is a note that reads, call me if you need groceries, a hug or anything! My doula put that there after I gave birth at home. For most of my pregnancy, I thought I would not need a doula at my homebirth; afterall, I had a wonderful midwife and assistant. As my pregnancy became more and more uncomfortable, I thought having extra support at my homebirth would be wise. I wanted the full attention from my partner, and I knew I would need my midwives to be able to focus their energy on the progression of my labor and on how well both our baby I were working together. My doula helped to support us as a family caring for my partner, our other child, as well as the much needed emotional and physical support that I ended up needing. It takes a lot of compassion and wise intuition to find the balance to meet the needs of both my family and the midwives. She provided massage, position suggestions, hydrotherapy, encouragement and cleaned, cooked, fetched things that were needed and even made coffee for everyone. While the midwives and I were caught up in the whirlwind of a difficult labor, she stood in the back keeping the peace. Every time I look at the note on my fridge, I smile and think about how deeply grateful I am to have had her with us on our birth journey.\\nAnd, Fabiane shares: My doula was my angel, she helped me through it. My labor lasted 36 hours and she was there all the way. She didn’t sleep, and I felt bad for her, she held me when I was in pain and scared, she told me everything was going to be fine. Her support made all the difference. Her kind words when I had to be transferred to the hospital made me realize I was not a failure for doing that. Meredith B. you are my angel!!!\\nSeveral women wrote sharing their experiences with both hospital births and homebirths and of a doula’s special touch.\\nBecky wrote to share:\\nWe had a doula for four of our births, and a midwife for the last three. We had a midwife and a doula for one of them. We had a doctor who did housecalls for two of the births. We had a hospital birth that made us decide that the rest needed to be home births. We didn\\'t have a doula for that one. I honestly wonder how differently that birth would have been if we had had a doula. Because the housecall doctor was much like a midwife would have been (although a different gender than most midwives), having a doula wasn\\'t as important as if it had been hospital. However, having a female there was a lot better than a male doctor, and she stayed with me for the hours and hours (and hours) that I was in labor before we called the doctor.\\nI had the same doula at both my hospital birth and my homebirth and it was well worth it in both cases. At the homebirth she obviously didn\\'t have to function as a warrior/advocate like she did at the hospital birth, but it was still wonderful to have her there in a supportive role. My husband was there to give support as well, but there is just a different kind of support that comes from another woman, especially one whom you know has experienced what you are going through at that moment. It also seemed at both births that she knew just what to say at the right moment when I was having trouble, whether it was how to take the edge off of the contractions, or helping things move along when my pushing was ineffective. Having a doula there for mental and physical support provided comfort and assurance, while allowing my husband to be \"in the moment\" with me while my midwife could focus on the particulars of the labor and delivery themselves. I wouldn\\'t have had things any other way and I would highly recommend having a doula at any birth, home or hospital.\\nThe benefits of a doula:\\nThe midwife team I had for my homebirth were trained doulas. I didn\\'t know exactly what would be midwife roles and what would be them acting as doulas. In hindsight I think having a doula with the midwives may have been a little nicer since it was my first homebirth/natural birth and the midwife seemed to be having to do a little more \"technical\" stuff than I expected but it probably depends on lots of factors. Either way, I did fine and the baby came out! My husband was there too doing his best. I look at it as a learning curve so I hope to have more kids and have less and less worry and pain with each birth! (doula or not!)\\nA midwife’s perspective\\nDebbie offered the following perspective on doulas at homebirth: I think doulas are wonderful for women choosing hospital birth. The kind of care the laboring woman gets from the hospital staff can really be supplemented by a doula. In that situation, a doula is a great benefit to the mother. I have a lot of doula friends, and I do not mean to disrespect them in any way. They go places and do work that I cannot emotionally handle. I am a homebirth midwife. I have had a couple interviews where a woman has asked if she should have a doula at her home birth. If someone wants to hire me and a doula, I will not try to talk them out of it. But I see my work as being a doula plus a midwife. I bring an assistant to every birth. If it’s a VBAC, I bring another fully-trained midwife. I don’t know what I would be doing during the birth if there was a doula there, too. If I had to sit in the corner and my only work was to check heart tones and catch the baby, I would feel like an obstetrician! I don’t want to do birth that way! I love birth! I love helping the woman through her contractions as they build and build. I love rubbing her back, holding her up, giving her bites of food and sips of drink, helping her squat, and breathing with her. During a birth I get tired, sore muscles from squatting and bending, sweaty from the heat, humidity and heavy lifting. But I wouldn’t have it any other way. I love my work!\\nSusan also wrote with the opinion that a midwife fills the doula role well: My experience of three homebirths is that the midwives play the role of doula as well. It seems to me that often one midwife is more \"doula\" and the other more \"doctor\", if that makes sense. The two together make a great team, and I\\'m sure their roles vary from birth to birth. If, perchance, there were only one midwife attending a birth, I believe a doula would be a wonderful addition.\\nA father’s perspective\\nBen wrote to share his family’s experiences with doulas: Our first birth was in the hospital and it was horrific. I had been raised in an environment friendly to home-birth, but when it was my first child, I over-rode my wife\\'s wishes and we had a hospital birth. It\\'s one of the few things in my life I truly regret.\\nOur second and subsequent births were at home. We used a doctor who made housecalls on our first two home-births, but we also asked some old family friends to help out. They were doulas. I didn\\'t even know what a \"doula\" was at the time.\\nFrom a male perspective, a doula is a life-saver. There I am, the \\'extraneous\\' member of the family (during birth, at least)--but one who is wracked with emotions for the safety of my wife and child. My wife leans on me for her emotional support--and I was just as much an emotional wreck as she was, with that \"I\\'m hiding my insecurities in machismo\" facade. The doulas were as much a comfort to me as they were to her. Kind words, a hug, a held hand, those life-saver words, \"It\\'s okay, this is normal,\" a gentle suggestion to step away for a few moments. And when the baby came, when the emotions flooded over us both and all we could do is kiss and cry and hug and hold our life\\'s joy in our arms together, the doulas were there to settle the room, soften the lights, take away the trash and clutter and afterbirth and details and all that myriad of things that neither one of us could even think about. While the doctor or midwife (we had both depending on the birth) was there to do all the technicals, to check on the health, the doulas were there to comfort, to settle, to relax the chaos of our lives and let us truly experience the first moments with our most precious treasure.\\nMen think about the costs, the finances, the harsh realities of life. If I were to give an expectant father advice about the new baby: Pay for a good midwife, pay for a good doula, make sure your wife is comfortable with both of them and slather the baby\\'s bottom and diaper with vaseline for a week after birth (meconium was a real shock till I learned that trick). :)\\nDoulas weigh in\\nGenevieve: My favorite place to doula is at homebirths. I give my clients a discount for having a homebirth because, as I always tell them, it is easier on everyone! It\\'s easier for the mom, baby, dad, doula, and midwife!\\nHillary: I am a doula who has attended homebirths. It\\'s a different thing. I find myself arriving before the midwife. Providing support for long labors so the midwife can conserve her energy for the important work she might need to do during the actual birth and immediately after. I find myself doula-ing the birth team. Making tea, providing support to the dad, taking pics and of course, supporting the mom as she wishes. I had a doula at my last birth and I relied on her a lot for emotional support during pregnancy. I\\'m so glad she was there.\\nI also posted to the Citizens for Midwifery Facebook page asking for input on the doula’s role at homebirth. While the responses were more varied, many women were squarely in favor of doula support during homebirth.\\nOpinions from the larger birth community\\nGillian: As long as the doula understands that homebirths often need the doula to \"do\" less and \"be\" more I think it can be a great help to the client and the midwives. I did go to one birth with a control-freak doula who couldn\\'t stop trying to fix everything but I think that was an anomaly.\\nWhat I notice, as a midwife, is that most clients are already paying for their homebirth care out-of-pocket and the idea of paying for additional support seems like quite a stretch. I haven\\'t had any clients choose doula care for their homebirths unless the doula was also a friend or family member working attending for free out of love. I think I give really good support as a midwife so I don\\'t think that my clients are lacking but during some births, especially the long ones, I can really see the benefit of someone else who can support while the midwife takes a snooze!\\nChristine: I was a doula before I ever got pregnant, so I actually had two at my first birth (one I had hired and one I had apprenticed with). Two was overkill, but my husband really appreciated having them there, probably more than I did! My next two births were fairly precipitous, so no doulas (although I had arranged to have one for the second birth). I loved being a doula at homebirths, and suspect that they are as useful at home (or maybe more so?) as they are in hospital. A doula empties the birth pool or makes supper for everyone, starts a load of laundry and rocks the baby while mom showers; basically does what needs to be done, so that everyone else can concentrate on their specific jobs...\\nFonda: My last two were at home. Having to shell out nearly $4k out of pocket each time, paying for doula on top of that would have been impossible. That said, being at home I didn\\'t really need one.\\nMaria: I had a homebirth but no doula. My midwife had two assistants and they acted very much like doulas, doing things like laundry, breakfast, partner support, etc. I also had a very fast labour, and think a doula would have been excessive. I recommend doulas all the time to my preggo friends, although I don\\'t see myself ever hiring one...\\nLaura: I think one difference between home and hospital is that generally you know more what you are getting in advance in terms of support in a homebirth situation--usually you have one or maybe two midwives in a practice whom you already know fairly well prenatally, and perhaps an assistant or apprentice who works with the midwife. So you have a pretty good idea before you go into labor how much support and what type of support your particular midwife/practice will provide. In a hospital setting, the L&D nurse is really the primary potential support person besides a spouse or family member--and that is somebody you don\\'t know until going into the hospital and it\\'s a wild card how supportive or unsupportive the L&D nurse will be of your wishes or how much that person can/will do in terms of emotional support or comfort measures. I think doulas are more critical/necessary for that reason in a hospital setting than in a homebirth setting.\\nThat said, I think it also depends on the particulars of your own homebirth situation. I hired a doula for my last homebirth because I had a midwife who worked alone (no assistant or apprentice) and I wanted to make sure there was an extra pair of hands/extra person available in case of 1) a long labor where my midwife and husband needed a break, 2) a complication of any sort, 3) as a backup support person for my older child in case her babysitter wasn\\'t available to come and be there with/for her (no family nearby who could be with her during the birth).\\nKatie: I planned a homebirth with my twins, and did not have a doula. I ended up with a (pretty terrible) hospital birth and I WISH I had a doula. I will have a doula if I ever birth again, no matter where I birth (but hopefully it will be HBAC!), and I recommend EVERY mother I know to have a doula, no matter where she births.\\nNatalie: My midwife had an assistant at my three homebirths. I felt no need for a doula, but if I had a solo midwife or was planning a hospital birth I would want one.\\nRaissa: I had the same doula for my first (surgical) and second (home birth) and wouldn\\'t have wanted it any other way. At home she came several hours before the midwife and really gave peace of mind for me and took some of the pressure off my husband. Worth every penny! (I literally paid for her with my babysitting money.) And, since the midwife got stuck in traffic, she unpacked the birth kit and almost got to catch the baby!\\nElizabeth: We had our baby at home with the help of two midwives and a doula. Our doula was amazing. She is still the person from our birth team that I talk to the most -- it has been 18 months since the birth of our child. Her care and concern for my family\\'s welfare has been ongoing and consistent. I strongly encourage any pregnant woman, regardless of where they intend to give birth, to hire a doula or search for volunteer doulas if hiring one is not financially feasible. I can\\'t imagine having a baby in a hospital without a doula.\\nKasey: I don\\'t remember if the doula showed up during my labor or after to help my midwife, but my placenta wouldn\\'t come out and I had to have a catheter put in, and since my husband was caring for the baby, the doula filled in (I\\'m petrified of needles and the like) and I have to say, I was very grateful she was there. If my husband couldn\\'t have been there for whatever reason, I would definitely want a doula present, no doubt about that.\\nI really appreciate all the people who lent their voices to this article. I very much valued the specific and customized postpartum care my doula provided to me after my last homebirth and I’ve concluded that a doula has the potential to offer something unique and precious to families, in whatever setting the birth takes place. I also agree with Elizabeth’s remark above, that it does seem like the doula is the most likely member of the birth team to remain in contact with the family in the future. Perhaps it is because, even given the friendliness of the midwifery model, there is less of a \"power differential\" between mother and doula.\\nAs we prepare to greet a new year, I propose this toast: Here’s to beautiful, empowering, healthy, fulfilling births for all women, in all settings, with the birth companions of their heart’s desire.',\n",

       " {'text': 'Fall-planted cool-season annual forages make economical winter feed for beef cows, say University of Missouri agronomists.\\nThey say several annual forages, including annual ryegrass, wheat, cereal rye, turnips and rape, can be fall-seeded for grazing in late fall, winter and early spring. Using a computer model, they compared the cost of those forages with that of stockpiled tall fescue, tall fescue hay and alfalfa hay.\\nThe annual forages were considered separately and in a limited number of combinations.

An August wedding that would have featured a jazz band and Mardi Gras Indian chiefs has been canceled and the telephone isn’t ringing like it did during the past two summers, said proprietor Don Hubbard.\\nThe irony is that the city’s ambiance and culture are as vibrant as ever, but the grim images featured on most nightly newscasts are causing vacationers to go elsewhere or stay home.\\n“We’ll never have enough money to buy advertising or put together a major PR campaign to counteract that,” said Toni Rice president of the New Orleans Multicultural Tourism Network.\\nNew Orleans recently had an influx of visitors attending the Essence Music Festival and a National Education Association conference, but it’s the future that worries Rice most. Organizations that have already scheduled major events there, or may be considering it, are wondering how long the problem will last and whether they should choose another city, Rice said.\\n“Much of the negative impact that [we’re] experiencing is more from misconceptions concerning the oil spill and its impact than reality,” explained Jim Hutchinson, assistant secretary of the Louisiana Office of Tourism. The areas most adversely affected are the coasts that depend on activities related to sports fishing and boating, which have been significantly curtailed.\\nHotels housing clean-up workers are enjoying an economic boon, but when those workers go home, Hutchinson said, the hotels are going to experience “tough times” because they’ve been unable to sell future bookings.\\nAccording to Rubincon, which collects forward-looking data from major hotels, the Florida Panhandle accurately illustrates the spill’s effect on Gulf tourism.

       " {'text': 'U.S. drug regulators approved another new weight-loss pill July 17. It\\'s the second approval in the last month, and may be the more effective of the two. Together, they are the first new prescription weight-loss drugs in the last 13 years. The newest drug, called Qsymia, is made by Vivus Inc. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced the first approval in late June. That drug, Belviq, is made by Arena Pharmaceuticals. Qsymia is a combination of 2 drugs already on the market. Phentermine suppresses the appetite. Topirimate makes people feel satisfied and full longer. In the 1990s, doctors often prescribed phentermine along with a different drug, fenfluramine, for weight loss. But in 1997 the combination was linked to heart-valve problems. Fenfluramine was withdrawn from the market. The FDA is requiring further safety testing of Qsymia after approval. In prior studies, people who took the drug for a year lost 7% to 9% of their body weight. That\\'s about double the 3% to 3.9% lost in studies of Belviq. The Associated Press wrote about the FDA decision.\\nBy Mary Pickett, M.D.\\nHarvard Medical School\\nWhat Is the Doctor\\'s Reaction?\\nIn the last month, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved two new weight-loss drugs. Neither one is a miracle cure.\\nThe FDA had earlier rejected Belviq because it caused tumors in animals. In June, it was approved. However, it won\\'t be available for another half year while the FDA considers what restrictions it will place on the drug. At high doses, it causes hallucinations, like the street drug LSD. There is concern that it may be used like a drug of abuse.\\nThe other drug, Qsymia, was approved this week. This pill combines two drugs that are already on the market, phentermine and topiramate (Topamax). Last year the FDA said it would not approve Qsymia because there was \"no long-term safety information.\" This year, with two years of safety data instead of one year, the FDA has given approval.\\nBut how long do you need to take this drug? For that matter, how long do you need to take Belviq? If you choose either of these new drugs, you are supposed to take them \"forever.\" If you don\\'t, the small amount of weight they help you to lose will come back. Qsymia will be available only through a restricted program. The program must ensure that women taking this drug are using reliable birth control because Qsymia can cause birth defects.\\nThere is no good drug on the market that can help people lose weight.\\nFirst, we can take over-the-counter drugs off your list. These include dietary supplements and pills that suppress your appetite. They don\\'t have a strong effect on weight loss, but they cause side effects.\\nPrescription weight-loss drugs do get some results, but every one of them has drawbacks.\\nWeight loss figures listed below are compared with a group that took placebo (fake) pills. People in the studies also made diet and exercise changes. The available drugs are:\\n- Belviq (lorcaserin)\\n- Weight loss: Half of the people who use this drug lose 5% of body weight, if they are obese to begin with. Half lose less weight than this. Hardly anyone loses more than 5%. People with diabetes lose less weight with this drug.\\n- Side effects: depression, migraine, memory lapses, lack of focus, low blood sugar reactions, fatigue and (in men) painful erections that last for many hours and may require emergency room treatment\\n- Qsymia (phentermine plus topamax)\\n- Weight loss: an average of 15 extra pounds lost in the first year\\n- Side effects: memory loss, suicidal feelings, heart rhythm problems and birth defects.\\n- Adipex or Ionamin (phentermine)\\n- Weight loss: an extra 2 to 13 pounds after 1 to 4 years\\n- Side effects: rapid heartbeat, high blood pressure, restlessness, anxiety and diarrhea.\\n- Xenical or Alli (orlistat)\\n- Weight loss: an extra 6 pounds after 1 to 4 years\\n- Side effects: oily stool, grease spots on underwear and uncomfortable urges to have a bowel movement in up to 1 out of 3 people who take it. Orlistat also may decrease the absorption of vitamins from food.\\n- Acomplia (rimonabant) (available in some European countries)\\n- Weight loss: an extra 10 pounds after 1 to 4 years\\n- Side effects: depression, anxiety or insomnia in up to 1 out of 4 users. Rimonabant increases suicide risk.\\nMeridia (sibutramine) was withdrawn from the market in 2010. Studies showed its long-term use caused heart attacks and strokes.\\nThe new drugs may cost more than $1,000 a year. Cost is one reason that a lot of users don\\'t stick with weight-loss medicines. Fewer than 10% of people stay with orlistat for at least a year. Fewer than 2% of people stay with any weight-loss drug for 2 years.\\nWhat Changes Can I Make Now?\\nAs old-fashioned as it sounds, diet and exercise are still the best way to lose weight.\\n- Exercise regularly.\\n- Reduce portion sizes.\\n- Choose lower-calorie foods, and make sure they are nutritious.\\n- Increase your fruits and vegetables. These should take up half your plate.\\n- Eliminate \"junk foods.\"\\n- Reduce sugars in your diet. Drink no sodas.\\n- Eat regular meals and don\\'t skip meals.\\n- Get enough sleep. This aids weight loss.\\nFor the right person, obesity surgery can be a successful treatment. I rarely recommend weight-loss surgery. It is not an easy way out of obesity. Complications and side effects are common.\\nOverall, surgery has more benefits than risks for young people with extreme obesity a body mass index (BMI) of 45 or higher. A woman in her early 40s who has a BMI of 45 could add 2½ to 3 years to her life expectancy by having surgery. For older patients and for men, the benefit is smaller.\\nWhat Can I Expect Looking to the Future?\\nLosing weight is hard work. If a company ever invented a drug for weight loss that is both safe and effective, we would be in \"Fat City.\" So are we there yet?\\nIn a word, no. If a drug is our answer to obesity, researchers are going to have to keep working on it.',\n",

       " {'text': \"Alright guys, I've got quite a few questions and this seems to be the correct place. Any help or opinions are greatly appreciated, so here we go!\\nI've currently got a pre-built system:\\nHP Pavilion Elite HPE-110F\\nAMD Phenom II X4 925(2.8GHz)\\n8GB DDR3 1333\\nATI Radeon HD 4350\\nEverything in this is stock, running on a 32inch TV via HDMI.\\nWhat I'm looking to do is make the decision on whether I want to upgrade this rig (and the best way to go about it) or build from scratch.\\nI'm an avid gamer and am gearing up for games like Guild Wars 2.\\nI'd love to get my system running the game at 1920x1080 smoothly with respectable quality settings. My budget ranges, for upgrading I'd be looking under 500 CAD preferably, anything higher than that and I'd probably end up looking into building from scratch at a slightly higher price-point.\\nI have noticed some of the biggest hits to my gaming come from the video card in the rig so I was looking around and saw a lot of recommendations pointing toward the Radeon HD 7850.\\nMy question here would be, am I looking into the right place to put more power into my pre-built system by targeting the video card?\\nWill upgrading ONLY the graphics card/psu(stock is only 300w) cause any severe bottle-necking due to the CPU or will it provide me with a significant boost to my performance on games? What PSU should I replace this stock with if I do decide on an HD 7850?\\nIt doesn't feel like it's quite the time to go full on and build a new system , but what do you guys think? How would you go about getting more out of this system for a reasonable price? Is it even worth doing over a completely new build from an efficiency and monetary standpoint?\\nSorry for the barrage of questions guys, and thanks in advance for any answers. I can provide any additional information required as well.\\na couple of things to watch out for......pre-built out-of-the-box systems are oftentimes proprietary in nature, which means in some instances you cannot simply drop in new hardware as the physical size of the replacement and its mounting will be different from what the manufacturer designed. This is not always true, but just make sure you do your homework, I got bit by trying to upgrade my psu in my last dell.\\nalso, if you are going to replace the cpu, make sure its replacement is the same wattage as the original. Many times, pre-built will use a lower wattage cpu (85-90 watts) so be careful not to drop in a 100-125 watt rated cpu or you run the risk of damaging the motherboard.\\nThank you all for the input I'll do some physical sizing and research on the mounting and probably upgrade just the graphics card and psu for now as posted with the Antec and the 7850 if the space and mounting allows [if anyone knows off the top of their head or from past experience feel free to let me know]. The hard drive is something I can also take care of. So I'll look into all of that. Thanks again guys.\",\n",

       " {'text': 'Mouse 28 is done:\\nI have completed the second clue on the Summer Solstice Mystery Shawl (spoiler alert!):\\nIt\\'s so crammed on the needle that it isn\\'t much of a spoiler. Just when I figured out how to do the dang nupps, there are no more. Unless I want to knit it again. Which I do not. Most of my knitting this week has been right here, working on my nupps. You wouldn\\'t think days of knitting would disappear so fast, but there you have it. Days and days of knitting. I just hope it\\'s worth it in the end.\\nI also wound up three more skeins of yarn for my Holey Jacket:\\nWhen this yarn is gone, I will be more than half done my sweater. The progress so far:\\nUnfortunately, I haven\\'t worked on it much, because the nupps have been attacking me, but when I do work on it, it goes fast.\\nMy navy sock also goes fast, when I work on it:\\nI have on my schedule that my Navy Socks should be done by next Friday. The next clue on the Summer Solstice Mystery Shawl doesn\\'t have anymore nupps, but it might be a long clue to knit, so I hope I can get these socks done -- if I don\\'t, no big deal. They\\'ll get done.\\nMouse 27 is ready to rock and roll:\\nI used The Culprit that unintentionally dyed my lovely skein of yarn pink. There is some satisfaction that will come of that when a cat rips it to shreds.\\nI blocked my Cardioid Shawl, which came out lovely, and I am very happy with it. Here it is pre-blocked:\\nHere it is blocked . The magic of lace!\\nI was going to start my Summer Solstice Mstery Shawl KAL on June 20th, but I had to have something to knit until then, so I started a pair of plain socks with a skein of Comfort Sock in navy blue:\\nThey\\'re good to work on when I am visiting someone.\\nI also started some crochet because ... well, because. Because I can and it\\'s really fun. Here\\'s my Holey Jacket so far:\\nI love this pattern. It\\'s quick and easy, and it has a little shaping, but it\\'s not hard. I also love the Wool in the Woods Cherub I\\'m using, too. The color is called \"Majestic Ridge\". The pattern calls for Paton\\'s Grace; if I still like this pattern when it\\'s done, I\\'ll order some for either another Holey Sweater or for something else.\\nSo then it was time to start thinking about the Summer Solstice Mystery Shawl. I chose a skein of Sockaholic in color \"Speakeasy\" that has been sitting in my stash for a few years.\\nI knit my gauge swatch, and tried out some nupps:\\nThe nupps on the top row are 3-stitch nupps; the nupps on the bottom row are 5-stitch nupps. Wendy gives the option of doing either one, or using beads, or doing nothing. I chose 3-stitch nupps.\\nWhen the 20th finally rolled around, I downloaded the pattern and started out. I like Wendy\\'s patterns, because you start out with the most number of stitches, and it only gets easier from there. I cast on my 277 stitches -- twice, because I ran out of yarn for my long tail cast on 30 stitches from the end. I used a cable cast on the second time, because I was bright enough to read the pattern and saw that the first row was a right-side row. About three repeats of the pattern into the first pattern row, I regretted choosing 3-stitch nupps. Those babies are harder than they look! Doing them a couple times is fine, but doing them 30 times in a row, with yarn overs and double decreases on either side of them, is torture. Probably, I will think they\\'re really pretty when they\\'re done, and they better be, dammit.\\nThat is the result of like, four hours of work, and the unending counting. I\\'ve got four more rows to do by next Tuesday ... if I live that long. Wish me luck!\\nYesterday I succumbed to the crochet bug. Last week, I got an email from Patons (because I registered on their web site for free patterns) with two lovely patterns. I thought, that is a lovely little cardigan, and went to look at it. It is crochet.\\nYes, it was exactly enough.\\nDouble sigh. And I already had two hanks wound into balls, too. So I started my Scallop Mesh Jacket, known to me as the Holey Sweater:\\nThat\\'s the beginning of the ribbing. I\\'m about to start the body now -- well, after I do some web site work. It is a lovely reward.\\nIn other (knitting) news, Wendy Johnson is having a KAL (Knit Along) in Ravelry and on her web site. It\\'s the Summer Solstice Mystery Shawl KAL of her own design. It starts June 20, so you have time to sign up! The pattern is only $2, but it will go up to $5 on July 17. You can join her group on Ravelry if you like; I did.\\nI\\'m going to use a skein of Sock-aholic in a color called \"Speakeasy\", which I won years ago in a drawing on the Knitters Brewing Company\\'s Ravelry group:\\nIt\\'s gonna be fun!\\nMouse 26 ...\\n... hiding in the begonia. Can you believe it? The year is half gone already.\\nMy Cardioid Shawl is nearly done:\\nA close up\\nWhen it\\'s blocked of course, it will be much prettier. By cramming it all on straight 14\" needles, I can\\'t really tell what it looks like until I block it. What if, through some strange manipulation of the stitches, it spells out \"Horrible Knitter\" instead of being a nice, normal lace pattern? You just can\\'t tell.\\nI do know that I was off a few times on my count and just fudged it; that two other times I dropped some stitches and picked them up -- probably wrong, but they were the right number, and it was better than nothing, which is what I would have if I let it all unravel; and the first time I knit a point, I neglected to pick up the wraps with the stitches which it VERY CLEARLY tells me to do in the pattern, and I didn\\'t go back and do it over because going back, with this very slippery yarn, is pretty much impossible. The yarn is very pretty, though. I will never use it again, but it\\'s very pretty.\\nI\\'m not sure how I can block it. That will take some figuring out. It has quite a bit of weirdly-shaped acreage. I could block it on the bed, if no one cares about sleeping there for a night ... we could have an all night party. Or, I could just figure something out. We\\'ll see.\\nRavelympics is Ravelry taking part in the Olympics, July 27 - August 12. The Olympic Committee has nothing to do with it, but don\\'t tell the Ravelry people; they\\'re absolutely going bonkers over the Olympics.\\nThe last time I did the Knitting Olympics was when they had the Winter Olympics of 2010, about two months before my stroke, when I spun the yarn for a pair of socks on my spindle and knit the socks, all over the span of the Olympics. I wore my socks to the Spa. That was Stephanie Pearl-McFee\\'s Knitting Olympics. It was really fun and I had a great time doing it. It was the most fun I\\'d had knitting in a long time.\\nUsed to be, the Winter Olympics were the only ones that registered with me. The Summer Olympics were in the middle of Tourist Season, and the store was too busy for me to focus on anything else. But now, I can focus on the 2012 Summer Olympics!\\nRavelry has tons of information. Tons. Just go to the Ravelympics 2012 group and see. You\\'ll find everything you need. Just remember the One Rule to Rule Them All: Challenge Yourself and Have Fun! (Which is basically two rules.)\\nI\\'m on Team Sockaholics, which hosts the Village Pub, a very nice place to knit. They have daily drink specials during the games. They also have a team Ravelympic Logo:\\nWhat events am I going to join? Hmmmm. Challenge yourself and have fun. I can only think of one challenge that I need to face: my October Frost cardigan (Lisa Lloyd, A Fine Fleece), which fits the bill for WIP Wrestling. It\\'s been lying untouched since before May 2012 (February 2011, to be exact), and it\\'s a challenge for me. I may not finish it during the Olympics, but I can make a dent in it, and maybe keep on going. Since I started it, I\\'ve done more cabling, and whole-sweater knitting, so I think it\\'s time. I am warming up my sticks, getting ready.\\nAre you in the Ravelympics?\\nMouse 25 is getting frisky:\\nTrying to get into my tea mug. Silly mouse.\\nThis week has been weird. I don\\'t really know exactly what I\\'ve done. There\\'ve been days with no knitting, but offhand, I can\\'t remember what I did do. One day we went up to Belfast, that was fun.\\nConsequently, my progress on the Cardioid Shawl has been slow, but steady.\\nI\\'m three rows before starting the border, which is the last section. The rows are now really long, 300 stitches or so, and to knit across one row takes forever, especially if it\\'s a pattern row. Did I mention that counting is not my strong suit anymore? I forget where I am, and I have to go back and recount and recount to get things right. While my hearts are lined up okay, the filler pattern is a little wonky, but maybe it won\\'t show. I\\'m a little wonky too.\\nWhen I finish this, I\\'m going to knit plain men\\'s socks. It\\'ll be refreshing!\\nFirst, I want to say Happy Birthday to my sister! These forget me not flowers are for you :) Mwah!\\nI finished my mouse, #24:\\nMy ruffly scarf is done, too:\\nIt\\'s not as long as I\\'d like it, but on the other hand, I couldn\\'t take much more of those size three needles and the ruffles, so I\\'m happy with it. It\\'s softer than I thought it would be. Mohair + metallic yarn would potentially = scratchy, at least around my neck, but this feels wonderful. Who knew. If I knit this again, I\\'d use fingering weight yarn and size 5 needles, and make it longer. It would be cool in self-striping yarn.\\nI started my Cartioid Shawl!\\nI was prancing with excitement. This is how far it is as of yesterday morning:\\nI love working on it! The never ending repeats are just beginning though, so we\\'ll see how long it takes. The yarn is very soft, but it\\'s a bit splitty -- not bad, but I noticed it. It could be these Signature stilletto-tip needles I\\'m using, they\\'re so pointy! They are awesome for some stitches where I have to knit or purl several stitches together, though.\\nThe pattern, like all of Wendy\\'s, is very well-written; it has both charts and written out directions, so you can choose what you like, and there are the numbers of stitches in all the parts every single row. When I get stuck on something, I just look and find out how many stitches I\\'m supposed to have in that section, and I can figure out what went wrong pretty easily. I got pretty good at reading lace knitting a while back, before my stroke, and luckily, it has stayed with me. With this shawl, it\\'s the end-of-section yarn overs that I usually miss, so far.\\nIt will be done next week!\\nLook what I got on Saturday:\\nSock yarn from Lisa Souza! That\\'s Appaloosa on the left, signed by both Lisa and Lorrie; Water Gardens in the middle; and Orion Nebula on the right. Her Sock! is 450 yards of fingering weight lusciousness made up of 75% superwash wool, 25% nylon, and dyed in colors that will make you weep for joy, weep, I tell you. Appaloosa is gorgeous. I never would have ordered a brown color, but now that it is my hands, it is so pretty!\\nAhhhh, now to let it marinate in my stash for a bit. I have a couple or three shawls to do first. But right now, I\\'m ruffling along, or maybe I should say flouncing along.\\nHappy Memorial Day, everyone!\\nI\\'d like, on the one hand, to start stuffing them, but I kinda like leaving them unstuffed, too, because I am not sure what I would do if they were stuffed and the cats discovered them! They\\'re so sneaky ...\\nI put a little more on my afghan and used up the rest of the lime green:\\nThen I started my Bohemian scarf ... I was a little worried I wouldn\\'t like the pattern. I shouldn\\'t have been; the pattern was wonderful! Every now and then you find the exact right pattern and the perfect yarn for it, and it is good; this was one of those times.\\nIt was a quick knit; it only took 2 days. I added a little more to my afghan:\\nThe Heart Cookie mitts that I blocked this week also took only 2 days.\\nBut now I am knitting something that is taking a couple weeks to knit. I am using this:\\nWonderful, sparkly skein of purple yummimess ... to make the flounced scarf of Drops design (Drops 129-28). I saw the woman at Have A Yarn in Mahone Bay, Nova Scotia knitting it in pale gray, and it looked so nice. I chose a ball of the purple, and got the pattern from her, and set it aside. Now I finally am getting around to it!\\nIt is knit on size 3 needles ... if I had really thought about it, I might not have done that. I could probably have gone up a size or two ... or three or four ... but I didn\\'t. I just blindly followed the pattern, like some demented sheep. It\\'s coming along nicely, but it seems slow after the last two projects!\\nI can knit about 6\" a day, on a good day. Maybe I\\'ll be done by next week! I keep telling myself that the ball is only 229 yards long ...\\nI ordered a Cardioid Shawl kit last week, and it came recently. It\\'s going right to the top of my queue!\\nIt contains the pattern, a skein of Sock-aholic Serene in Blueberry Pie, and a charming little stitch marker with a heart motif. This is going to be cool, and it\\'s a great cause, too.\\nSpeaking of causes, Lisa Souza has a thing on her blog about the Grace Foundation. She\\'s donating the proceeds from sales of her \"Appaloosa\" colorway until June 30 to the Grace Foundation, which is having trouble due to the Susanville 70 -- a group of horses that have been rescued, and have been tied up in a legal battle ever since, and now the pregnant horses have had foals, and the months of eating sand and debris has had long term liver problems for the horses, and medical bills for the Grace Foundation. I\\'ve made my purchase to help! Those poor horses...\\nIt\\'s been another busy week. My mouse got finished:\\nShe is Modest Moude 22 -- she has a yellow polka dot bikini on.\\nFollowing that, I went on to my Five Year socks and completed them, too:\\nThat\\'s socks before and after blocking. I made the effort to make them match exactly on the stripes; in this yarn, it makes a difference.\\nThen I went on and finally knit Mary Jane Mucklestone\\'s Heart Cookie mitts. I have been wanting to knit them for so long!\\nMitts in progress, Thursday morning.\\nAll done :) Thursday afternoon.\\nIt took me 3 months to get around to them, but I knit them in two days. They\\'re a really fast knit. The top two pictures are more accurate as far as the colors go; the sun streams in my window in the afternoon and messes up my colors.\\nMy new project is A Little Bit Bohemian, a scarf, by Rebecca Carmichael-Stromgren. It\\'s a free pattern on Ravelry. It\\'s a simple knit, and should go fast, but I might change my mind. Sometimes I am just sure that a pattern will work with the yarn, and sometimes I just don\\'t know. Right now I just don\\'t know. I love the yarn I am using, and it\\'s very special yarn, and I want it to be something wonderful. I am not sure yet that they\\'ll play well together or not.\\nThe yarn was bought in St. John, New Brunswick in a great open air market. I ran across a stall run by a very nice woman (I forget her name, but Sharon knows her) who spins and knits, and sells her yarn and knitted things all over. It\\'s handspun yarn that looks to have a lot of mohair in it, a little silk, and some wool, maybe merino. It\\'s a 2-ply yarn, with one ply of a spring green, and the other ply a brilliant cobalt blue. It\\'s so pretty! The skein has a nice halo to it, so I have good hopes for a dressy scarf. It looks sport weight, but the halo also tells me that it probably knits up thicker. I\\'ll try it on size 8 needles and go up from there. It\\'s fun to play with!\\nMouse 21 is having fun in the sun, finally:\\nYesterday I finished my Itchy Scratchy sweater. I know, I only had one sleeve started last week, but it\\'s been rainy, and I was close to being done, and I wanted to finish it. I knit the sleeves:\\nThen I sewed it together:\\nActually, I crocheted the pieces together. My husband helped pin it for me. Here it is, ready for blocking:\\nIt looks pretty funny here. Moss rib really pulls in a lot, but I was encouraged when I stretched the sleeves out to sew them into place. I blocked it by washing in the machine (cold water, with Eucalan), spinning as much water out of it as possible, and putting it on the wooly board for final blocking:\\nIt looks good, doesn\\'t it? I like it; it doesn\\'t feel so itchy anymore. The fabric really opened up with blocking, and it\\'s a nice, comfortable weight. I think he will wear it a lot ... next year!\\nMy next project is some Five Year socks. In October of 2007, I took my ill-fated trip to Bar Harbor, where I went to Bee\\'s and got some stuff:\\nYou can read how the yarn exploded in Helen\\'s Restaurant here. Anyone know what yarn the sock yarn is? I didn\\'t take a close enough picture to identify what yarn it is, and I foolishly didn\\'t write it in the blog post anywhere. Anyway, I knit the beginning on Sand Beach:\\nAnd that\\'s the last time I posted about it. Fast-forward to 2012, when I found the sad little sock lying forlornly in one of my bins while I was inventorying my yarn stash. I had actually knit as far as this, when I broke a needle and stopped:\\nI since had found size 0 needles, which were in it, so I can start right up again. I\\'m glad I found it!\\nNow on to a glass of Nicky wine to celebrate:\\nDespite it being rainy all week, Mouse 20 loved it and went naked all the time:\\nAnd here\\'s his bottom, to show you he has no tan lines:\\nThe Crosswired Socks are done:\\nI loved knitting these! It\\'s addictive, keeping on knitting those teeny stripes, and crossing the cables as you go. It\\'s like a little Hanne Falkenburg for socks, except it\\'s Wendy Gaal of Knitters Brewing Company, and she\\'s fabulous.\\nThe Itchy Scratchy sweater is coming along nicely. I got the front done (finally), knit both the front neck and the back neck, and joined the shoulders. Then I sewed the neck pieces together and weaved (wove?) in the ends.\\nThe neck was pretty damn fiddly, but it was better to knit it on the two body parts separately than to try and wrestle with it in my lap trying to knit it in the round on six double-pointed needles. No matter how many needles I had in it, they were gonna fall out. So, I set it aside in my mind, knowing how much I preferred a neck that\\'s all one piece, and knit it in pieces with two little seams. We must make compromises, that\\'s what people who are one-handed do. And really, my husband will never know the difference.\\nJoining the shoulders was also fiddly, but I got better at it with practice. I figured out the rest of the pattern for the sleeves, how many to cast on, how many increases to do and how many rows between them. It\\'s all downhill from here! I started the first sleeve. and I\\'m loving it. This sweater is going to be yummy-scrummy!\\nThe body looks too small and the ribbing is doing a weird curl-up thing, but that\\'s because I am using moss rib for the main body pattern, which pulls in monstrously until it\\'s blocked. When it\\'s blocked, it will look better. I hope.\\nIt\\'s slow, but it\\'s still going forward :)\\nFirst, here is Mouse 19, unveiled:\\nYou will notice a color change on the face. I finally reached the end of the ball of gray that I had ... but then I found another ball of tan Lush in the stash that I was inventorying last week. Small miracles, like yarn showing up just when I need it, are mysterious but good; thank you God. Now you can see tan mice, just in time for summer! They are naked too, so no tan lines. Silly mice.\\nMy Crosswired Socks are 75% done:\\nThese socks are kind of addictive to knit; I just want to keep going and going. Didn\\'t I say that last week? It\\'s still true. I may want to knit these again sometime, but not right away, because there are about a trillion other things I want to knit first.\\nI really miss the Itchy Scratchy sweater. It\\'s pining away behind me on top of the knitting bag (which never houses any actual knitting projects, just yarn and tools and needles and stuff). I didn\\'t knit on it at all this week, because I was knitting on my socks, but I wanted to. I\\'ll knit on it for the next two or three weeks til it\\'s done, and then I\\'ll block it and it will look fabulous, and everyone wil tell me I must be a GENIUS, and it will fit perfectly, and my arm and leg will miraculously be all better, and I\\'ll take up scuba diving, and we will go live in Mexico where I will teach knitting to rich tourists.\\nI made two mice this week, to make up for not making any last week. Here are Mouses 17 and 18:\\nI didn\\'t work on my Itchy Scratchy sweater this week at all, because I\\'ve been obsessed with my Crosswired Socks:\\nThese are so much fun to knit: it\\'s like eating popcorn. I can\\'t put them down! But I have to be mindful of not knitting too much, or the carpal monster will get me.\\nI like how there\\'s a different pattern on the back of the leg than on the front. While I was knitting, I dreamed of making a hat with the new colors of Good Karma Farm yarn -- Hibiscus and New Mowed Lawn (I\\'m going from memory here).\\nAnd, as promised, I have been spinning a little bit every day:\\nMy spinning has improved, but it still needs work. This is superwash merino that Tracy dyed. She gave it to me with the promise that I would spin it and knit with it someday. Little did she know that I would have a stroke! So here is my promise in the keeping, I\\'m spinning it, Tracy!\\nI divided the fluff in half before starting, and the first half is just about done. It will take me about a week to spin the other half, and then I\\'ll ply it and set the twist. I never really know what I will make with the yarn until I end up with it. I intended to make socks, and I still may, but ya never know. They yarn may surprise me. I think it\\'s still a little thick for sock yarn, but we will see.\\nMy lilac bush has sprouted leaves in earnest now. I love that fresh, green color that signifies the beginning of spring!\\nI didn\\'t knit any mice this week; I\\'ll have to knit two next week!\\nI did knit a little on the Itchy Scratchy sweater this week. I missed it. I got to within 15 rows of being done the front. Then I just have the neckband, the sleeves, and finishing, and it will be done!\\nI have enjoyed working on the Crosswired Socks this week. I am up to the heel turn, which will be fun, and then I start patterning the back as well as the front of the sock. These socks are gonna be great. I thought as I knit, there are so many wonderful color combinations -- I may have to make another pair!\\nThis is obviously a pre-blocked picture; there are no weird colored stripes like in the picture, there is just bad shading. I am loving this pattern! It\\'s a lot of fun to knit, especially after learning how to cable without a needle. I am whizzing right along now!\\nHappy Friday the 13th!\\nMouse 16 welcomes the world:\\nAnother thing that came to a well-deserved end was the Man Socks:\\nI think the the ribbing on the right-hand one makes it more distinctive. I really can\\'t believe that I ran out of yarn on these socks. They are for a man, but he is not a super-long-legged-foot man. The two other times I made socks out of this yarn, I made girl sizes, and had a lot left over. I\\'m kind of dumbfounded that I not only ran out, but 29 rows from being finished? Really?\\nEnough about that.\\nI didn\\'t work on the Itchy-Scrtchy sweater this week. The socks really took over my life, and I wanted to finish them and find out what the end was going to be. Now that they\\'re blocking, I can relax, and get back to the sweater. It\\'s right here.\\nThe exciting new thing I\\'ve started is Crosswired Socks, from Knitters Brewing Company. I chose Foo Foo Drink and Dreamsicle for my colors. They are Mary Jane colors, and when I have to choose colors, I\\'ll stick with Mary Jane\\'s color sense over mine any time. So far they don\\'t look like much, but I like the colors!\\nYou petered out on me 29 rows from the completion of my pair of socks. In the future, I promise to use size 2 needles, not size 1\\'s. Rather than making my brain hurt and tear out what I have already done on the other, finished, sock, and then finishing both of them, I\\'m finishing this pair with the corresponding green that I found in my stash of yarn. It helps to have a large stash of yarn sometimes. I hope the recipient doesn\\'t mind; I don\\'t think he will.\\nNeedles, why do you try to commit suicide on a daily basis? This morning I found one of you jumping purposely over the table\\'s edge, directly into the furnace\\'s hot air vent. Luckily, you didn\\'t go down all the way; my husband was able to retrieve you. But I\\'ve watched you, trying to escape, always falling out in the worst situations possible. You know I can\\'t knit without all five of you!\\nI have 17 more rows to knit, and then I have to bind off. Please don\\'t go wrong. The Man will love you, honest.\\nSunday morning we had a breakfast for the family, and it was great to see everyone again. Georgia was a real cutie pie! I got to thinking, as I watched her, that the Little Girl Cardigan I knit was never going to fit her by Christmas, so I gave it to her ... it fits perfectly now. Good thing, and she will have fun wearing it while she plays outside!\\nShe also got the cutest hat that Lynne knit her, which she put right on. It looks great with the cardigan! She is a stylin\\' little girl. I can\\'t believe how fast she is growing.\\nPam and Kevin gave me my birthday present a little early, because Pam said I deserved it for getting my finger to work. They gave me these gorgeous earrings, which were made partly from gold from a ring of my father in law\\'s, and beach stones. Jennifer Nielson, a fabulous jeweller, made them for Pam and Kevin. Thank you!!! I love these earrings:\\nThey are very special!\\nGrace crept out after the Small Quick-Moving Person went away, and she\\'s sleeping in her sunbeam now.\\nThis is the wee mouse that scampered off my needles last weekend:\\nThis is the front of my sweater as I s-l-o-w-l-y work up the neck:\\nHere is the man socks, also dancing slowly:\\nI think I\\'m going to run out of yarn on the socks, and that makes me knit slower, because I don\\'t want to find out. Since I knit them from the toe up, I can just finish when I run out of yarn by using some from the finished sock, and then finish that sock again, but just thinking about it makes my head hurt. One way or another, they\\'ll be finished soon. Then on to other projects! There is something, a sock knit-along, that I\\'d like to start next week, so we will see. :)\\nMy sweater takes a long time to get anywhere, but it\\'s good to know that I\\'m doing a whole sweater. It\\'s coming out just as I envisioned it, and that\\'s a big plus, especially since I\\'m making it up as I go along, hehe. The ol\\' brain isn\\'t entirely dead.\\nMy hand isn\\'t wiggling as much today as it was, but it IS wiggling. That\\'s another plus! I think my thumb is connected to it ... I don\\'t see it, but I feel it. It\\'s hard to describe. I will work at what I can do. It\\'s a fun toy to play with, anyway.\\nI\\'m making progress on my knitting. Here\\'s my weekly mouse:\\nAnd here\\'s my sock:\\nAnd here\\'s the front of my sweater:\\nThe back is done, but I forgot to take a picture of it. Ooops.\\nIt\\'s funny, but I knit a lot yesterday, and I should be feeling the effects of it today, but I\\'m not. My hand feels fine. One of life\\'s little mysteries; maybe my hand was getting tired of Winter and it wanted a little Spring to warm it up.\\nI waited for my buttons to show up in the mail, but they\\'re not here yet, and I was commiserating with Lynne about it. She said, \"Get in the car. We\\'re going to Belfast!\" And off we went. Helen has a lovely store there, Heavenly Socks, where I got the most beautiful buttons:\\nLynne even sewed them on for me! It was a good trip all together :) Thanks Lynne!\\nThis week\\'s mouse is called \"Stripey\", for obvious reasons:\\nHe\\'s cute. I have to start stuffing my mice soon, with catnip and stuffing. I forget how many mice I have so far, but I figure stuffing 10 or 12 mice at a time is probably about the limit for most people.\\nMy Itchy-Scratchy sweater is about 3 or 4 inches short of a full back:\\nI tried to finish the back yesterday, but my hand and arm was telling me, \"Silly Beth, trying to do too much again. I shall have to hurt you!\" and I stopped. Part of the problem was, I also knit way too much on the sock day before yesterday, but I got one sock done!\\nI am worrried that I will not have enough yarn to complete the second sock. When I weighed the sock and weighed the yarn, they were about the same; this is one time I really miss my digital-readout scales that I had at the shop. Anyway, either I will have enough yarn, or I won\\'t. If I don\\'t have enough, but I have just short of enough, I can always unravel the top of the finished sock until they\\'re even. One way or another, they\\'ll be good!\\nI love the colors. If I have to knit slowly, I am sure enjoying the ride. It\\'s killing me to work at this snail-like pace, and not just dive in and zoom up the back of the sweater and be done the pair of socks by now, but working slowly has it\\'s advantages. I thought at first that it would be drudgery, but it\\'s not.It gives me more time to think, which is kind of fun. You never know what I\\'ll think of next :)\\nFirst, look at this:\\nThis is Shelagh\\'s Bobble Hat! Isn\\'t it gorgeous? It makes me happy :)\\nIn other news, remember not to spill coffee over your open laptop, like I did. It wasn\\'t much, and I immediately picked it up and my husband turned it off for me. Being one-handed is dangerous in so many ways! It is fried, so I am typing on my iPad now. I will not be able to take pictures; there\\'s no interface for that on the iPad.\\nFurthermore, I am learning that patience is required when knitting a sweater and a pair of socks when you are trying to avoid carpal tunnel. I knit a fair amount on my socks day last Friday, and it felt pretty good, so I then knit 10 rows or so on the Itchy Scratchy sweater, and that was too much. When I woke up this morning, the pain in my hand was telling me that I had done wrong. I didn\\'t knit at all the next day. I have decided that 10 rows a day period is my limit, apparently, and that really sucks, but not as bad as being handless entirely and in a lot of pain does. We make our choices. So I will leave you with three quotes about patience:\\n“Patience is not passive; on the contrary, it is concentrated strength.”\\nEdward G. Bulwer-Lytton\\n“Patience iswaiting. Not passively waiting. That is laziness. But to keep going when the going is hard and slow -- that is patience.”\\nI don\\'t know who said this, but I like it.\\n“The key to everything is patience. You get the chicken by hatching the egg, not by smashing it.”\\nArnold H Glasgow\\nI will patiently knit 10 rows a day until the sweater is done!\\n(Photo from Necrodancer)\\nThis week\\'s mouse is named Groovy:\\nHe\\'s adorable. I am going to go nuts making brown mice. Maybe I can jazz them up!\\nI have not knit much. My 20-rows-a-day plan got sidetracked when I woke up one morning, after only two or three days of 20-rowing, with a severe pain in my one good hand. I decided to take a break from knitting for a couple days and did only one catnip mouse and 2 rows on the sweater. Since then, I\\'ve done only ten rows a day on the sweater, or 15 rows a day on the man sock. It is slow going, but slow progress is better than none.\\nTherefore, my Itchy-Scratchy sweater is not yet done the back, because it is getting heavy, and I really can\\'t handle that. But I still do several rows when I work on it.\\nI have it done to about two inches beyond the armhole. Poor sweater, will it ever be done? The good news is, my technique seems to be working, as I have not had a recurrence of the hideous pain in my hand.\\nMy sock is a lot easier to knit, as it\\'s lighter and uses size 1 needles instead of size 8 needles.\\nI\\'m knitting them toe up. I like that way better now, since when I am finished, the toe is already grafted. I just can\\'t graft with Kitchener stitch anymore, and I have tried. It comes out looking horrible. That\\'s not to say I won\\'t do it anymore, but I am trying to let it go and accept that toes of socks done that way are not going to be perfect as they were before. There is no really good way to hold the piece in order to graft it; you have to turn it around a lot and then it gets funky. As you can imagine, I am not letting go of this as well as I should, but until then, I\\'ll make toe-up socks.\\nExcept for these:\\nThis is my current ball of adoration, pictured with \"Saxony\" socks by Lisa Lloyd in A Fine Fleece. I just love that design and that whole book. It is one small step to knitting all the items in the book before I die. The yarn is Ball and Skein\\'s \"Sophia\" (80% merino/10% cashmere/10& nylon) in color Bittersweet. It is lovely. I have 1 skein, 400 yards, which is enough for socks, but maybe I\\'ll look on Ravelry to see what other projects people are making with it. There are some lovely scarves in Victorian Lace Today that would be nice, too. It\\'s fun to ponder!\\nHappy Leap Year Day!\\nOn February 7, 2011, I started October Frost by Lisa Lloyd.\\n(photo from knitterBunny on Ravelry)\\nI did the gauge swatch, and then I started. It was kind of a big jump for me, because until then, I\\'d only done scarves and socks since my stroke. I really wanted to make October Frost, and before my stroke, it seemed easy. Remember thinking everything was easy to do, but you didn\\'t have the time to do them? Now I had all the time I wanted, but everything was hard.\\nI did the ribbing on the back, (I blogged about it here) and I started the cables .... I started those damn cables three times, and I kept doing it wrong, miserably wrong. I just couldn\\'t think straight, could not count, had trouble getting \"left\" and \"right\" mixed up. The first time I did the cables, I think I had every other cable twisted the wrong way in the sweater, and I ripped it out back to the ribbing, vowing to do it right the next time.\\nThe next time, I paid close attention, which was harder than I thought. Why is this so hard to do, I thought. I got the first repeat of the pattern done, and saw only about 4 cables twisted wrong. It was a big improvement! But I ripped it back to the ribbing and set out again.\\nThe third time, I got it right, checking carefully every single row, but man ... this was really tough. My brain was sore. I didn\\'t like to look at it. So I set it aside and concentrated on doing scarves for Christmas, and felt better. I changed my status on Ravelry to \"Hibernating\" for my October Frost, but I left it out where I could get at it, because I was bound and determined not to let some silly cables win. I was a little depressed though, because I used to have fun doing Aran knitting, specifically because the cables were challenging, but I could do them easily. Now they were really hard.\\nNow I\\'m thinking about it. My brain is not as foggy as it was last February, partly because of the wheat-free thing and partly because I have exercised my brain a bit and can do more. I am going to try October Frost sometime this year, and we\\'ll see if I can get it right this time. Wish me luck!\\nThe mice are getting into the Grateful Dead:\\nI am using the rest of the skein of Florista Fino, and I probably have enough for two or three more. It\\'s great yarn! I should get more from Webs while they still have it .... but the yarn threatening to take over the house says, not yet. Sigh. Yarn, why must you be so demanding....\\nI finished the baby kimono:\\nIt\\'s the cutest thing ever, despite the I-cord. I discovered that knitting I-cord one-handed is much more fiddly that I liked, and I renamed I-cord, which is \"Idiot cord\", to be called \"B-cord\", which is more aptly named \"Bastard cord\". However, the resulting kimono is so cute, that I have further renamed it \"C-cord\", for \"Cute cord\". In the future, any design having that design element must be wicked cute for me to knit it.\\nI have ordered some buttons, but they are not here yet. Needless to say, the buttons will make it extra-cute. Pictures when they get here!\\nMy Man Socks have not progressed very far in the wake of finishing the baby kimono and starting the sweater for my husband, but they\\'re a lttle further along:\\nI finished the toe shaping and started the K 3, P 1 ribbing for the top of the foot. I love these colors; they\\'re very rich.\\nMy husband\\'s sweater is named the Itchy-Scratchy Sweater, because of the Simpsons. He\\'s a big fan. I\\'m using 10 skeins of what I *think* is Bartlettyarn, but I\\'m not sure. It has no tags at all, and Bartlettyarn and Christopher Sheep Farm and Briggs and Little usually have tags. This also is stuff that have had for so long that I don\\'t even remember how I got it. It feels like Maine wool though, so that\\'s what I\\'m going with. I made the pattern up, but it\\'s a V-neck, drop shoulder pullover with a Moss Stitch Rib pattern that I put in to keep it from being too boring. I let him pick the pattern that he liked from Harmony Guide: Knit & Purl. I think he done good. It\\'s a simple P 1, K 3 pattern that uses the P 1 and the center K 1 of the K 3 as ribbing, with moss stitch in between the two stitches. There\\'s no counting higher than three, either :)\\nI\\'m using sizes 6 and 8 needles, so it goes along pretty fast. I will probably regret saying that later.\\nOne thing I am doing on both my Man Socks and the Itchy-Scratchy sweater is I am doing 20 rows on each project every day. It\\'s a good goal to work for. That gives me plenty of time to write my blog or do other knitting projects, too. Right now I\\'m happy with my sweater and socks, because I just started them, but after awhile they will become two horrendous beasts that sit on my shoulders and whip my ass, but I shall persevere because hey, it\\'s only 20 rows a day! Awesome :)\\nI find the more I knit, the more I don\\'t get done! Maybe that was my problem all along. I just knit too much, so I never finished anything.\\nWell, that\\'s all different now. With only one, or two, or even three things going, I can finish what I start. It\\'s hard not to cast on that whiz-bang thing that you have just got to make, until you finish what you\\'ve got going. I know; I really want to make Mary Jane\\'s Heart Cookie Mitts and Stephanie\\'s Cloisonée mittens, but NOT until I finish what I\\'ve got going, as well as a sweater for my husband, which will probably not be done before it\\'s too hot to wear it this year, but oh well. I have heaps and heaps of knitting to keep me entertained.\\nI got my wee mousie done on Sunday:\\nI finally ran out of the blue. Now I\\'m on to grey, a much nicer mouse-like color.\\nI finished the Little Girl Cardigan, except for the buttons:\\nI did have enough yarn to finish it! See what I have left? Hmmmm it\\'s probably enough for a mouse and a half....\\nI did some work on the Baby Kimono:\\nI know what your thinking, Gigantor Baby, but trust me, it\\'s not. It\\'s all in one piece to the underarms, and it will be fine. I think. Although Lynne did ask me if it was a baby blanket when I was first starting it.\\nFor such a little thing, it sure has a lot of stitches! I knit for several hours and only got an inch and a half done. I am hoping it speeds up a little when it splits for the sleeves.\\nJust for fun, and to take my knitting out if I am going anywhere, I started a pair of Man Socks for Christmas:\\nI am using Trekking XXL in burgundy, brown, yellow and green and making toe-up socks on size 1 needles. the pattern is Straight Up Socks, by Kellie Oreb for Knitter\\'s Brewing Company. I\\'m changing the pattern a bit, as I don\\'t want to do all that k 2, p 2 ribbing. It\\'s funny, I like that ribbing and could do it endlessly in a scarf, but in socks, it drives me crazy.\\nNow I\\'ve got to hurry up and finish the baby kimono, because the baby\\'s coming, and also my husband\\'s sweater is waiting....',\n",

       " {'text': 'Wow! what is that? Its role on this cosmic ‘bodyteam’ is called the ambassador. Firstly, I see it as our core, like a divine family within us. Mama, Papa, Sister (a line from the old sitcom Happy Days when Richie Cunningham was asked who he lived with just came to my head..)\\nIt includes the Upper Burner (the Heart, and Lung), Middle Burner (the Spleen and Stomach) and Lower Burner (the Liver, Intestines, Bladder and Kidneys).\\nAs stated in the classical medical textbook, Yellow Emperors Classic of Medicine, the Upper Burner opens outwards, spreads the five tastes of the food essences, moistens and pervades the skin, fills the body, and is like mist. It runs from the base of the tongue to the entrance of the stomach.\\nThe Middle Burner receives vital energy, expels the wastes, steams the body fluids, transforms the refined essence of food, and connects upwards with the Lungs. The Middle Burner runs from the entrance to the stomach down to its exit at the pyloric valve.\\nThe Lower Burner directs the separation of the clean fluids from the dirty fluids, and facilitates the excretion of urine.” The Lower Burner runs from the pyloric valve down to the anus and urinary tract.\\nNotice that the Triple Burner is described in terms of what it does. It is called a “concept” because it really exists as a function, rather than as a physical organ. Ancient Chinese medical text states: ‘The Upper Burner controls intake, the Middle Burner controls transformation, the Lower Burner controls elimination.’ On a spiritual level this seems akin to how we receive things in our life. Things, people, experiences come into our sphere and we then choose how to take them in, transform them and eliminate them. Some stay around for just a moment and others for years or a lifetime each one serving a valuable purpose in our growth on this planet.\\nWhen I think of the number three I am reminded of me and my two siblings. It’s a huge change from two. Suddenly, it becomes a party with three. And boy, it was so essential for us to get along since we had to deal with each other all the time. So, with these three pairs of organs they too need to get along. They are all coming together here to see how they get along. That’s what I love about Chinese medicine, it is all about looking at the whole picture.\\nSince this is the last organ network out of the whole series, (large intestine-lung, kidney-bladder, liver-gallbladder, small intestine-heart, stomach-spleen) paired with the pericardium, I like how it incorporates such a vast terrain in the body. It rises up allowing us to survey the big picture. It gives us three elements, three areas of the body and brings them together.\\nMeridian Channel (energy pathway): Starting at the tip of the ring finger this channel travels up the arm to the collarbone. It then descends to the chest, abdomen and lower burner like a Sheep dog rounding up the pack! Ascending back up to alongside of the neck around the ear it splits into two channels one ending on the cheek, the other on the outside of the eyebrow.\\nEmotion: Paired with the Pericardium and the Heart, Joy\\nColor: Orange Red. The drawing is green, yellow and orange to represent the three chakra colors of the heart, solar plexus and sacral area\\nElement: Fire though it brings together air, fire and water.\\nYin or Yang: Yang\\nEssential Oil: Since we are combining three areas of the body, a blended oil sounds appropriate. Try a bit of ginger, bergamot and geranium (for men pine or cedarwood). This combination can be rubbed on the whole torso with a carrier oil to meet the needs of warming, soothing and flowing the three areas.\\nMudra (hand position): The three part sequence where you bring the hands together in prayer gesture to start. Separate the index, middle and ring fingers leaving the pinkie and thumbs touching. This creates a bowl where the base of the palms and the pinkie and thumbs gather the energy yet the open top of the other fingers allow newness to come into the bowl. Hold this at your chest area until you feel you have gathered enough energy from Source. Bring all the fingers in like a Venus flytrap plant where the middle knuckles come together on the four fingers and the thumbs are side by side. Hold this at your core where you transform this energy you have received. When you feel it has worked its way through you allow it to be released by pushing the knuckles down to the third section of the fingers so the backs of the fingers are touching then progressing to the backs of the palms. It resembles an inverted prayer position. Holding this at your sacral area one can imagine the spent energy being excreted back to the earth where it can be recycled.

       " {'text': 'How long has the gadget-loving world been talking about the idea of a Googlephone? For at least three years–before there was an iPhone, let alone an Android. The longer people talked about it, the more revolutionary it was supposed to be. Who better than Google, after all, to show what an Android phone can be and shatter people’s assumptions about how phones and phone services are sold while it’s at it?\\nOn Tuesday, Google finally announced the Googlephone, in the form of the Nexus One–if you define “Googlephone” as a phone with Google software and Google branding, sold by Google on a Google site. And…there’s nothing radical about it. Judging from the first few hours I’ve spent playing with one, it’s a good phone–a really good phone. The best Android phone so far, and (along with Palm’s Pre) one of the few phones worthy of being discussed in the same breath as Apple’s iPhone.\\nBut everything that’s better about it is evolutionary, not revolutionary. It’s a little bit better than Verizon’s Droid, which was a little bit better than HTC’s Hero, which was a little bit better than the MyTouch. And considering that Verizon’s Droid spent just two months as the undisputed Android-phone-to-buy, it wouldn’t be the least bit surprising if the Nexus One was ousted by another little-bit-better phone by Spring. There’s also not nothing particularly remarkable about the way Google is selling the phone, although the company says to stay tuned for more phones with more hardware and carrier partners–including a Verizon Nexus One this Spring.\\nBottom line: If Android-based phones are going to catch up with the iPhone–and they might–they’re going to do so in a series of baby steps, not through the Great Leap Forward that some folks expected this phone to be.\\nLike other journalists at Google’s launch event, I received one as a review loaner. Here are my first impressions. As is my wont, I’m going to provide them in the form of a FAQ.\\nHow’s the phone’s industrial design?\\nNice, but there’s just not that much you can do to distinguish one keyboardless touch-screen phone from another–they’re all thin rectangles that are mostly display. The Nexus One manages to pack slightly larger screen than the one in the iPhone 3GS (3.7″ vs. 3.5″) into a phone that’s a tad narrower and therefore comfortable in the hand. It’s made of what seems high-quality plastic, and build quality is solid. It’s got the standard Android back, menu, home, and search buttons, plus a trackball similar to the one in phones such as T-Mobile’s MyTouch. (The trackball lights up, thereby serving as a status light for notifications such as the arrival of new e-mail–clever!) Overall, in fact, the N1 feels like a much sexier, sleeker, next-generation MyTouch.\\nHow’s the screen?\\nExcellent. The resolution is lower than that of the Droid (480 by 800 vs. 480 by 854), but the AMOLED screen is brighter and more beautiful. (At least if you turn off the auto-brightness feature and set the sliders on the two phones to the same level–in my limited testing, the N1′s auto-brightness feature seemed to choose a dimmer level than the Droid’s.) Both easily trump the iPhone 3GS’s 480-by-320 LCD, which at this point is that phone’s most archaic hardware spec.\\nHow’s the camera?\\nI need to test it more. But it seems like a better 5-megapixel model than the Droid’s–which sometimes produces murky results–and the LED flash lets you snap shots in places where the iPhone’s flashless 2-megapixel camera is a no-go.\\nAnd the onscreen keyboard?\\nIf you’re comfortable with the iPhone keyboard, I think you’ll like this one just fine, and might even prefer it–I immediately began typing with almost no mistakes, in both portrait and landscape modes. If you don’t have any experience with onscreen keyboards, expect to spend a few days getting the knack of this one.\\nAnd the voice recognition?\\nThe fact that it’s built in everywhere you can get to the keyboard is a big step. I dictated a few e-mails and got close to 100% accuracy–which was better than either Walt Mossberg or David Pogue got. But the server-based processing was more sluggish than with Dragon’s Dictation app for the iPhone. At today’s event, Google also talked up using voice recognition for stuff like getting driving directions when you’re at the wheel. Which only sounds a little safer than typing while driving.\\nThe Nexus One lacks multitouch, right? Is that a big deal?\\nI’m mostly curious about why it doesn’t have it–at today’s event, the Google execs onstage said they were contemplating adding multitouch, but didn’t seem to want to talk about the subject. I miss it–the way you zoom in and out via icons is both less intuitive and less elegant–but it’s not a dealbreaker. It’s just one of multiple ways in which Android is more ungainly than the iPhone OS. I am, however, finding that the phone’s single touch isn’t flawless: More than with the iPhone, I sometimes have to tap more than once before the N1 notices I’m trying to tell it something.\\nYour thoughts on the browser?\\nYou know, I think I prefer it to the iPhone’s–if only ever so slightly, and partially because the higher-res screen handles Web pages better. I certainly prefer the use of a unified URL bar/search field, and the way Google Suggest guesses what I’m trying to type and shows me options I can click on.\\nAny other particularly good stuff in Android 2.1?\\nThe new version of the Gallery photo viewer–developed in partnership with Cooliris–is a highlight. It has an extremely polished 3D interface, and two-way sync with Picasa Web Albums that lets you browse your online snapshots as well as ones stored on the phone. Except for the lack of multitouch, it’s much more impressive than the iPhone’s Photo app.\\nThe Nexus One has some of the most potent specs seen in any phone to date: a 1-GHz CPU and 512MB of RAM. Is it speedy?\\nYup. It’s admirably zippy, even when you’re running multiple apps. Then again, both the iPhone 3GS and the Droid generally feel pretty snappy, too, and some of the N1′s perormance seems to go into needless frippery, like the way icons scroll off in 3D as you thumb through them, and the Live Wallpaper animations (which remind me of Windows 98′s dreaded Active Desktop). But even if the N1′s hardware specs don’t make for a radically new experience, I’m glad that Google and HTC erred on the side of beefiness, and I hope their move prompts competitors to do the same.\\nHow about the infamous Android program storage limit?\\nIt’s still there–you get a skimpy 190MB for apps, versus gigabytes on the iPhone. That’s because Android doesn’t let you store programs on a MicroSD card, for reasons that apparently have to do with security concerns. (The iPhone uses fixed memory rather than a card slot, so it doesn’t have to confront this issue.) Google says it plans to fix this limitation. Eventually.\\n(Also, the 4GB MicroSD card bundled with the phone is a tad miserly given that even the $99 iPhone has 8GB of storage. But maybe Google figures it might as well scrimp there given that you couldn’t save programs on a bigger card anyhow.)\\nGoogle is excited about what it calls its new approach to buying a mobile phone. Should I be?\\nIt’s possible that the fact that Google is now a phone merchant has major longterm implications for the wireless business. For now, though, it’s not a particularly big whoop. The company is crowing about the fact that you order the N1 online and get it delivered to you ready to use with T-Mobile. But there’s nothing new about that–I got the same benefits when I bought a Nokia from Amazon.com back in, um, 2003. Neither is the fact that Google will sell you an unlocked N1 for $529 a new and exciting development: Palm, Nokia, and Sony Ericsson all already sell unlocked phones.\\nThe N1′s odd inability to do 3G on AT&T means that even if you buy the unlocked phone rather than the $179 version that requires a 2-year T-Mobile contract, you’re almost certainly going to sign up for T-Mobile service. (At least buyers of unsubsidized N1s get T-Mobile service at a cheaper rate.) Things will get more interesting once the Verizon version shows up in the Spring and you get a true choice of carriers.\\nCertain things about Google’s phone site are impressive, such as the copious demos of the phone’s features. However, I hungered for more information, like T-Mobile coverage maps and straightforward answers to questions like “Can I use this thing on AT&T?” To be fair, the information that Apple.com provides on the iPhone doesn’t run particularly deep, either. But in that case, you have the option of buying the phone from AT&T, Best Buy, Wal-Mart, or an Apple Store–and asking a real person questions about the gizmo before you buy.\\nI don’t think Google’s direct sales approach for the Nexus One is an argument against the phone. But neither do I find myself saying “God, I hope all phones are sold this way someday.”\\nIs the N1 going to kill the Droid?\\nDefinitely not, even though it’s the better phone in multiple ways . The Droid has a physical keyboard, and even though it’s just adequate, it frees up all of the display for stuff like word-processing documents–a major boon for anyone who thinks of a phone as a tiny laptop. And while a Verizon N1 is on the way, the Droid is on Verizon right now. The N1 is the more polished, powerful phone, but much of its refinement comes from the Android 2.1 update that Motorola says Droid owners will get at some point,\\nHow does it compare to the iPhone?\\nComing up with ways in which the iPhone 3GS maintains a formidable lead over the N1 is a cakewalk. The iPhone OS’s interface is less cluttered. There are not only five times more iPhone apps (100,000+ vs. 20,000) but the best ones, such as Tweetie, may be five times better than their Android equivalents. Google doesn’t even seem to be trying to catch up with the iPhone’s entertainment features: Android lets you copy music from a PC but not sync it, and has no provisions for buying or renting video. Bottom line: The iPhone is a more highly evolved, refined device.\\nOkay, but the Nexus One beats the iPhone in some respects, right?\\nYes indeed. There’s the screen, the multitasking ability, the less heavily-regulated app store, the free turn-by-turn driving directions in Google Maps, the built-in voice recognition, and the deeply integrated Google Voice support while the iPhone doesn’t have a Google Voice app at all. (You can route all calls over Google Voice and use its voicemail instead of T-Mobile’s if you choose.) If you use Gmail and Google Calendar on your PC or Mac, you’ll love the Android versions. The camera may prove to be at least a modest point in its favor, too. And you can buy the unlocked model and use it overseas with a cheap SIM to avoid paying nightmarish roaming charges.\\nWhat’s on your wishlist for the Nexus Two?\\nAndroid could use a more streamlined interface–one with fewer buttons and menus, in fewer places. I’d also love to see some sort of Google Docs built into the phone, with support for editing word-processing documents, spreadsheets, and presentations as well as viewing them. Beyond that, if I were Google I’d do everything in my power to help third-party developers build as many exceptional apps as possible.\\nOkay, that’s enough questions and answers for now. I’m headed to the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas in a few hours. I’m taking the Nexus One with me as my primary phone, so I can put it through some demanding real-world tests. In the meantime, lemme know if you have more questions I might be able to answer…',\n",

       " {'text': 'Peter Jones has little doubt what Sussex needs to reduce crime. \"We need to give a boot up the backside of the CPS [Crown Prosecution Service] and get more people before the courts – they can be so risk-averse it\\'s mind-boggling. It infuriates the public and infuriates the coppers who work their backsides off that the CPS sometimes cannot be bothered to push forward cases.\"\\nJones, the leader of East Sussex county council, hopes he is not merely engaged in wishful thinking. The Birmingham-born politician is outlining what he wants to do if he becomes the county\\'s first police and crime commissioner.\\nJones is one of the Conservative hopefuls running for a position that some insist is significantly more powerful than that of MPs and most ministers. In as little as 120 days the Sussex electorate will join the rest of the country and vote for an individual who will acquire a mandate to organise the police budget, prioritise resources and hire and fire chief constables. Jones, from Hastings, is particularly excited about the position\\'s co-ordinating role and is presiding over a slick campaign – \"Vote PJ\" – to ensure he fulfils his crime-fighting ambitions. Sussex is likely to see more offenders in prison should Vote PJ gain traction.\\nThe one sticking point that worries even those going for the job is the apparent loss of interest by the government in what was touted as one of David Cameron\\'s flagship policies and one of the most important police reforms of recent years.\\nIn Haywards Heath, close to the geographic centre of Sussex, public apathy towards the role of commissioner is overwhelming. \"I haven\\'t heard of any of them,\" said Brenda Griffin, 65, when shown a list of the candidates on the Sussex shortlist. Not one of 30 people asked on the town\\'s main artery, South Road, recognised a single candidate. Nine out of 10 people were unfamiliar with the profound changes to policing that will shortly take place.\\nAnthony Kimber, a 65-year-old retired army officer from Rye, is also in the running, but perturbed by the apparent lack of government input. \"The problem is that the government has become involved in other policing issues, this has slipped onto the back burner.\\n\"The government has not allocated any money upfront. It\\'s offered a website and I do tweeting [118 followers at the time of writing] but there is not a lot of publicity. I know party members who have not been officially told of my candidacy, which is disappointing.\"\\nNonetheless Kimber has set out a detailed manifesto for his plans as commissioner. Anyone in Sussex guilty of antisocial behaviour should, he warns, watch out. His priority is creating an intelligence base of all incidents and people involved in low-level crime and disturbances.\\n\"I would take the sort of approach seen in New York and California, really focus effort and intelligence on the problem, work out whether it\\'s troublesome families the government is talking about or if it\\'s mobile groups of youngsters. I believe that with serious effort and a targeted approach we would get to the bottom of it: who the culprits are, where they do it, and why they do it.\"\\nKimber talks enthusiastically about landing the £85,000-a-year job and working with the current chief constable and community partnerships to eradicate antisocial behaviour throughout the county\\'s 4,000 square kilometres.\\nThere are at least 10 candidates vying for the role. Sussex has produced more Tory candidates than almost anywhere else (six) and a Conservative commissioner is favourite to prevail as voting patterns are predicted to reflect party lines. All must outline how they will revolutionise a police service that must lay off 1,050 staff and make savings of £50m over the next three years.\\nAnother Tory candidate is a successful Arundel businessman and local councillor, Paul Dendle, who perhaps controversially seeks a moratorium on the government\\'s steps towards privatising police roles. \"You should delay privatisation until you reform and reduce inefficiency, otherwise you are locking in inefficiency for the length of the contract, which is a waste of public money. A lot of private companies are rubbing their hands because they know how inefficient it is,\" says Dendle, whose website features police minister Nick Herbert on the streets of Sussex.\\nDendle\\'s big idea is \"lean systems thinking\" based on the Toyota car production model in Japan, which involves asking frontline workers for their input to boost morale and improve efficiency.\\nOther Tory candidates include the director of a funeral firm, a former Metropolitan police chief inspector whose attempt to become Britain\\'s first Chinese MP failed during the last elections, and the only woman candidate – district councillor and entrepreneur Katy Bourne, who chairs the Conservative Women\\'s Organisation.\\nLabour is fielding two hopefuls, with the preferred candidate unveiled on Monday following a ballot by party members. Hastings councillor Godfrey Daniel is pledging to tackle antisocial behaviour, hate crime and domestic violence.\\nHe, too, is worried that the process could be undermined by apathy. \"Low public engagement is a worry. It\\'s important that people know what they are going to vote for, otherwise the elected candidate could be quite scary.\"\\nDaniel is competing against Paul Richards, 44, of Eastbourne, a special adviser to two Labour cabinet ministers who has twice unsuccessfully stood for parliament and is the author of How to Win an Election. All have their work cut out if they want to fire the imagination of the Sussex public.\\n\"I\\'ll vote for anyone who lowers my council tax,\" said one Haywards Heath mother, unaware that tax is one of the powers that will elude the incumbent. Nicola Smith, 74, who has lived in the town for 35 years, wanted to see a detailed CV of all hopefuls before she even considered choosing.\\nNext month, Sussex Conservative party members will meet to choose their preferred candidate. They must hope the electorate match their enthusiasm.',\n",

       " {'text': 'PROVIDENCE - Dennilson DaRosa is only in the eighth grade and is on the shy and quiet side, as well. So he was not about to argue with New England Patriots officials when they announced last month that Matt Light was retiring.\\nThe lineman who helped the Pats win three Super Bowls might be giving up his role as Tom Brady\\'s blindside protector, but DaRosa knows that Light is not about to stop helping others.\\nDaRosa is excited because Light is going from helping Brady and the other Patriots to helping him and Dwight Rockett and Ellijah McLean and Ethan Richardson, too.\\nAll four are eighth-graders from Providence who are about to benefit not from Light\\'s blocking, but from his generosity. They are among 16 students from four states who have been chosen to take part in a program organized by the Matt Light Foundation that has grown into one of the most detailed and special programs provided by any professional athlete.\\n\"It\\'s pretty awesome,\" DaRosa related the other day during lunch break at the Highlander Charter School. \"They were telling me we\\'re going to do some rock climbing and a little bit of archery. I haven\\'t done that before. Before we go, we get to go to Dave & Busters and meet other kids who are going.\\n\"I\\'m psyched,\" he added. \"We do all that and I get to go to Ohio, too. I don\\'t get to travel much, so that\\'s going to be nice.\"\\nAll that barely touches the surface.\\n\"I don\\'t think the kids understand the magnitude yet,\" said Dana Borrelli, the expanded learning director at the Highlander School.\\n\"I think it\\'s incredible what this person (Light) does,\" Borrelli said. \"He could be spending millions of anything. He could be doing something flashy. He\\'s not doing that. He invests his time and energy into kids and really does everything he can to move them along. I think that\\'s really awesome.\"\\nLight uses his fame with the Patriots to raise money for his foundation. He has a number of events every year, the biggest of which is a Celebrity Shoot Out he holds each fall at the Addieville East Farm in Burrillville.\\nLast year alone, the event, which includes appearances by many of his Patriots\\' teammates, raised $300,000.\\nIt is what Light does with the money that is so impressive. He has turned his foundation into a year-round program to help youngsters in need.\\n\"I believe in helping out any way you can. I have very strong faith and was very active in our church growing up,\" Light offered. \"I feel like there\\'s a real purpose for every person in life and believe we\\'re all here for a reason. I think we all need to help each other out, and honesty and accountability and working hard are things families embody and I personally embody.\"\\nHis program director, Nick Shuckman, organizes and runs the program. He accepts applications and then goes to each area involved and interviews candidates at their school.\\n\"These are kids we see who have potential, but maybe don\\'t have all the benefits others have,\" Shuckman explains. \"We want to provide opportunities for them, help them live up to their potential.\"\\nThe eighth-graders he selected this year include DaRosa, McLean from Greene School, Ethan Richardson from Times2 Academy and Dwight Rockett from the Urban Collaborative Accelerated Program. One of the biggest aspects of the program is flying the participants to Ohio in late June.\\n\"It\\'s a leadership camp,\" Shuckman explains. \"Matt has 500 acres in Greenwood, which is his hometown and where his family still lives. We involve the kids in all types of activities. We do career educational tours with businesses, meet with business owners and find out what it takes to be a success. We do community projects.\\n\"There also are a lot of fun activities for the kids. We\\'ve done paint ball, go-carting, motorcross, archery, fishing and anything we can think of to make it fun for them,\" Shuckman said.\\nThere is a pond for swimming. There is an outdoor kitchen that even includes a pizza oven. Participants also do some physical conditioning. The site includes a hiking area, Chenoweth Trails. This year\\'s group will have a surprise. Because there has been mud in other years, being out in the woods, a 30-by-30-yard slice of astro turf has been installed to allow exercising on firm ground.\\n\"Every night we do a fireside chat, where we sit with the kids, talk about what\\'s going on with their life, what it takes to be a leader, how a leader acts and just have real conversations about life,\" Shuckman said.\\nThe kids sleep in two yurts, which are tent-like structures.\\n\"We have six bunk beds in each, I sleep in one with eight of the kids and Matt sleeps in the other with the other eight kids,\" Shuck related.\\nLight does not simply sponsor the program; he is part of it. He is there guiding the kids himself through the week. He is not alone, either. His wife helps do some of the cooking. Light\\'s father, Bill, is a huge proponent and each year designs an activity he conducts with the kids.\\nWhile the week in Greenwood is the highlight, the foundation keeps in touch with the kids all year. Shuckman checks on how the kids are doing in school. He flies in a couple times each year to touch base with the participants and offer any assistance he can provide. The kids even receive the phone numbers for Shuckman and Light and are encouraged to call if they need help.\\nThis goes on for four years. Eighth graders are selected because the program wants to follow participants all through high school.\\n\"Matt is not one of those guys who says, \\'Here\\'s the money; now go do it,\\' \" Shuckman said. \"He\\'s with the kids every step of the way. To see a guy like him who is so involved with everything - it\\'s so impressive. I feel fortunate to be part of it.\"\\nLight has a simple explanation for why he does it.\\n\"We want these kids to serve something bigger than themselves; they help others and help themselves by doing that,\" he said. \"A lot of these kids - all they need is an opportunity. We use the outdoors as a real teaching tool and a way to get kids to open up. And with us, these kids aren\\'t given anything; we make them work for everything they achieve.\\n\"But through that, they understand and value hard work, they learn work ethic, and they become proud of what they do and want to share their accomplishments,\" he said. \"These kids are learning how to become great citizens, great neighbors, great friends. They\\'re learning how to be great people. We\\'re helping them build that.\"\\nLight\\'s retirement will become official on Monday.\\nThe Patriots have announced that a news conference will be held at 10:30 a.m. in the Hall at Patriot Place to honor Light and his contributions to the Patriots over the past 11 seasons.\\nThe session is open to the public.',\n",

       " {'text': 'How Hostess Failed: Hedge Funds vs. Unions\\nSenior Editor, CNBC.com\\nWhen Hostess Brands announced that it would close up its operations, the forces most responsible for that decision were two hedge funds that control hundreds of millions of Hostess debt and which have finally decided they won\\'t squeeze any more filling into the Twinkie.\\nThe funds, Silver Point and Monarch, are what are known as distressed debt investors. They buy the debt of troubled companies—usually at steep discounts. Some consider them white knights who are willing to take make risky investments in companies on the verge of failure. Others say they are \"vulture funds.\"\\nOnly Silver Point and Monarch could have kept Hostess out of liquidation and kept the Twinkie bakery ovens firing. But they were, ultimately, unable to reach a deal with the unions that represents the workers who make and deliver products like Twinkies, Wonderbread and Ding Dongs. Without large union concessions—what some would say, total union capitulation—the hedge funds decided Hostess would have to die.\\nThis is not the first time Hostess Brands has entered bankruptcy. Weighed down by an balance sheet heavy with debt and pension obligations, costly labor rules, and declining sales, the company sought bankruptcy protection under Chapter 11 in 2004.\\nAfter nearly five years in bankruptcy, Hostess emerged in 2009 under the control of a private equity firm called Ripplewood Holdings, which invested $130 million of new capital in the company. The keys to coming out of the bankruptcy the first time around were concessions by the two groups most responsible for Hostess falling back into bankruptcy just 3 years late: the unions and lenders that owned secured company debt nominally worth around $450 million.\\nIn the deal that allowed Hostess to come out of bankruptcy, the unions agreed to concessions that would save the company around $110 million a year in labor costs. The lenders, led by the hedge funds Silver Point and Monarch, agreed to provide a new secured loan of $360 million, forgive half the existing debt, and exchange the rest of that debt for a payment-in-kind loan.\\nIt\\'s worth mentioning that we don\\'t know how much of a loss—if anything—Silver Point and Monarch took on the loans by agreeing to reduce the amount outstanding. As David Kaplan pointed out in his extensively detailed article in the August 13th issue of Fortune, the amounts the hedge funds paid for the debt are not in the public record. Distressed debt funds—critics call them vulture funds—typically pay far less than face value when buying the debt of troubled companies.\\nThis wasn\\'t enough to save the company.\\nThe company\\'s sales declined and attempts to roll-out new products more in line with changing consumer tastes flopped. Ripplewood put tens of millions more into the company in the form of new equity and subordinated debt. Silver Point and Monarch put in another $30 million and then, after the company filed for Chapter 11 again in January of this year, another $75 million.\\nWhat happened next was just a mess. The CEO quit. The unions described the pay of the new CEO as \"looting.\" Acrimonious would be a very mild term to describe relations between management and the unionized workers. One person familiar with the matter described it as \"all-out war.\" The place to turn for the details of this is, again, David Kaplan\\'s Fortune article.\\nRipplewood basically fell out of the picture during this period. Its equity investment was worthless, and it\\'s subordinated debt was deeply underwater. It just stopped showing up at negotiations with the unions, according to Kaplan.\\nThe folks left at the negotiating table with the unions were Silver Point and Monarch.\\nHere\\'s how Kaplan put the situation as of last summer:\\nWhat the hedge funds want is some degree of capitulation from a union whose members will otherwise lose thousands of jobs in liquidation. If the hedge funds don\\'t get it, they\\'ve concluded, the company isn\\'t worth saving. Without the hedge funds\\' blessing, no Hostess turnaround is possible. Right now, according to sources with knowledge of Hostess\\'s debt structure, Silver Point and Monarch each hold Hostess obligations with a market value of between $50 million and $100 million. Those sources also say each hedge fund probably paid somewhere between $125 million and $175 million for that debt. So even with losses to date, both hedge funds have ample skin in the game -- skin they\\'d like to get out of the game sooner rather than later. Of course, if the hedge funds again forgive sizable debt, they\\'ll probably want sizable equity in return this time.\\nFinally, there are the woebegone Teamsters. They have plenty of skin as well -- and feel as if they\\'ve been fleeced out of almost $100 million from Hostess after the company \"temporarily\" ceased making union pension contributions last August. That move by Hostess was a breach of its collective-bargaining agreement with the unions. The Teamsters\\' leadership has fulminated to its membership about the hedge funds in particular. \"The financial folks make a living of feeding off distressed companies,\" Hall says. \"They lose sight of the fact that there are real families with livelihoods at stake.\" At local unions across the country, the hedgies have become the devil incarnate.\\nNow we know how this story ends. The Teamsters agreed in September to a deal with reduced pay and benefits. But the Bakery Workers union rejected the deal and went on strike. Hostess warned that if the strike continued it would not be able to stay in business. But the strike went on. And now Hostess is out of business.\\nThe hedge funds concluded that Hostess isn\\'t worth saving. The unions either bet the hedge funds would blink before putting the company into liquidation or decided that it was better to sacrifice the jobs of Hostess workers than give in to demands for further pension concessions.\\n(Read More: Not So Yummy: 15 Major Fast Food Failures)\\nAlthough it now appears that Hostess is done, this is not the end of the story. The brands Hostess owns retain value. Someone will likely produce Twinkies again. The plants and workers are also valuable and will likely find bidders. Silver Point and Monarch—as well as the other secured creditors—will realize some value for their investment in the company, although certainly far less than they had hoped. (But, since we don\\'t know how much they spent on the debt, we may never know whether they gained or lost on the deal.)\\nAnd, of course, we\\'ll be in for a long bout of recriminations as everyone involved points fingers at everyone else. The truth of the matter may just be that Hostess was a failed enterprise that just could not be saved.\\nWe\\'re on Google Plus too! Click here for John\\'s Google page. Questions? Comments? Tips?

Hodson will be taking his rightful place in the Louisiana Sports Hall of Fame.\\nHodson is part of a nine-member class that includes NBA All-Star Shaquille O’Neal, tennis great Chanda Rubin and eight-time NFL Pro Bowler Kevin Mawae. The 2013 induction class will be enshrined June 29 in Natchitoches to culminate the June 27-29 Louisiana Sports Hall of Fame Induction Celebration.\\nWith Hodson’s addition, there will be nine athletes with ties to the area in the Hall of Fame.\\nSkating forward — “We’re entering the building phase. The train is out of the station, it’s moving, and we are going to go ahead and get this thing constructed as soon as they can get it agreed to.”\\nThat was the assessment of Terrebonne Parish President Michel Claudet of the status of Houma’s skate park.\\nFireman’s Skate and Bike Park will be an enduring legacy of longtime Bayou Cane Fire Chief Jerry Gautreaux who left in his will $10,000 to get the project going — as long as it would not be named after him.\\nAnd going it is. The time is quickly approaching when the young folks will have another outdoors option, and that is the best news of all.\\nIn a nation and region as given to obesity and all the health problems associated with it, we need to be encouraging activity, not stifling it. Because of safety concerns, though, bikes and skateboards just aren’t appropriate everywhere.\\nThanks to Gautreaux, the Terrebonne Parish government and the many dedicated residents who have not given up on this project, they will have a good, safe place for their activities. If all goes as planned, it should be ready by the end of the year.\\nTax assistance — It is that time of year, the time between when workers get their income tax forms from their employers and when they get their tax returns filed.\\nThis needn’t be an anxiety-filled time, though. There is help for many of those who might need it.\\nIf you can afford to take your taxes to a professional, do it. If you feel comfortable filling out the forms yourself, do that as well.\\nBut if you meet some income criteria and need some help with your taxes, you might just have to go to the library.\\nCatholic Charities is offering help for low-income local residents through the Volunteer Income Tax Assistance Program.\\n“We saw a need for it and thought it would be very valuable. It allows us to help residents save the $200 or $300 they would otherwise have to spend,” said Jennifer Gaudet, associate director of individual and family assistance for Catholic Charities Houma-Thibodaux. For information, call Catholic Charities at 876-0490.\\nFamily fun — Carnival festivities in New Orleans have a bawdy reputation for irreverence and indulgence.\\nCloser to home, our parades tend to be more family-friendly. But there are options for people who want to enjoy the sights and sounds of the parades without being around any alcohol and tobacco use. For those, there are the alcohol-free zones being sponsored in Houma by the Alcohol and Drug Abuse Council for South Louisiana and in Thibodaux by the city, the Lafourche School Board, the mayor’s office and the Bayou Council on Alcoholism and Drug Abuse.\\nIn Houma, the zone will be at the Good Earth Transit Depot, 7617 Main St. In Thibodaux, the zones will be on East Seventh Street from East Thibodaux Middle to Thibodaux Elementary, and in Chiasson Park at Jackson and West 10th streets.\\nHowever you choose to enjoy the parades, there are good options right here in Houma and Thibodaux.\\nReader comments posted to this article may be published in our print edition.

       " {'text': 'On August 31 I officially became a triathlete. With a big day ahead of me I went to bed early the night before. I woke up at 4:45 am. I was full of energy and ready to go. I took in my pre-race meal a bagel and an apple and some gatorade.\\nThe bike stalls were first come first serve so I made sure to get there early so I had my pick. I contemplated my stall strategy and decided that it was best to have mine close to the exit to the bike course. This way I was close to leave and close when I returned. This strategy worked well. Next I went to get my racing numbers marked on my body and set up my transition area. By this time it was time to test the water and wait to go.\\nThe pre-race meeting ended and I got in the water. To my surprise the water was like bath water. I was happy to be swimming in warm water for once. I took my mark and the gun sounded. We were off and, boy, is a swim start crazy! I was hit multiple times, but never hard enough to brake my stride. I kept going. At one point at the very beginning when everything was still crazy I thought to my self, \" What am I doing here.\" The feeling subsided when I was one of the first 50 in a heat of over 150 to exit the water.\\nI exited the .6 mile swim with a time of about 16:00. I hustled to my bike and I was off. The bike was fun because the course had great scenery. I felt great on my bike and turned in the 14 mile bike in under 45 minutes. I know that I lost a good bit of time because I had a mountain bike and not a road bike. I was however very pleased. I took a little more time in the transition area to take in some liquids, but I was off relatively quick. It was time for, what I thought, was going to be my favorite part of the race. WRONG! The guy I trained with sometimes told me that the course was flat. It really was not. I ran about 3.5 consistently, but then my lower back started hurting and I slowed to a walk, but not for long. I was running again in no time, slower than before but running none the less. As I got closer to the finish line I heard the crowd cheering and that gave me an energy boast. I crossed the line sprinting. It felt good to cross that line. I was by far the most amazing feeling. All the sacrifices had paid off. My total time was 2:07 to finish a .6 mile swim, 14 mile bike, and 5 mile run. Overall I was 343 out of 750 or so racers. I love tri\\'s and will continue to tri over and over again.\\nwriting, training, hanging out with friends, living life',\n",

       " {'text': 'The Bald Truth\\nBefore he ever threw a big-league pitch, Mark Prior was heralded as a once-in-a-generation talent. He had the size, the demeanor, the poise, the mound presence, the intelligence, the command and the maturity of legend. And oh, did he ever have the stuff.\\nHis mechanics? Perfect. One expert after another said that with his mechanics, he\\'d never get hurt.\\nWhen the Twins passed on him to draft their hometown boy, Joe Mauer, they were ridiculed for being stupid, cheap or both. (I guess now is as good a time as any to say their decision has turned out OK.)\\nThe Cubs gave Prior such a huge signing bonus after they selected him in 2001 - $10.5 million - that it\\'s still a record today.\\nThink about that. Think about how salaries in sports - baseball especially - have escalated. And yet this guy\\'s bonus of eight years ago remains the gold standard.\\nThe first time Mark Prior pitched for the Cubs, it was obvious he had \"it\" - that special something separating the superstars from everybody else.\\nFans had such high expectations for him that I took to calling him Messiah Mark. Some ripped me for \"making fun\" of Prior, but the more observant readers realized I was poking fun at the worshippers, not the faux deity. (Besides, I liked how Messiah Mark Prior sounded. Kinda rolls off the tongue, no?)\\nHe went 18-6 in 2003, his first full year in the majors. In the second half of that season, he was 10-1 with a 1.52 ERA. He was simply the best pitcher in the world, A SURE THING.\\nPrior continued to shine in the postseason and was only five outs away from a shutout victory that would have vaulted the Cubs into their first World Series in six decades. Though he, like his teammates and manager, choked away that game, his potential obviously was limitless.\\nMore than a few surveys of GMs, managers, scouts and sportswriters concluded that, after old-timers Greg Maddux, Randy Johnson and Tom Glavine reached the 300-win plateau, it wouldn\\'t happen again until Prior got to 300 some 15 or so years down the line.\\nThen came the injuries. One after another after another.\\nAs the injuries piled up, experts began blaming flaws in his pitching mechanics for his plight. Some were the same experts who just a few years earlier had said his mechanics were perfect.\\nMany fans who once worshipped Messiah Mark suddenly were all over him. Baseball people, including some in the Cubs organization, were calling him a wimp.\\nHe didn\\'t know the difference between soreness and injury, they said. He had a low pain threshold. He was too selfish, too worried about his next contract, to man up.\\nWhat a wuss!\\nI wasn\\'t Prior\\'s friend or fan - that\\'s not my job - but I did feel sorry for him, and I said so in several columns back then.\\nI didn\\'t feel that way because of his ailments. After all, injuries are part of sports. And certainly not because the money train had stopped pulling into his depot. With the millions he made, he should be set for life.\\nNo, I felt sorry for him because total strangers were questioning his integrity, passion, manhood and will to compete. These idiots somehow felt qualified to look into his brain and his heart. It wasn\\'t until the surgeries began that people finally acknowledged: \"Hey, you know what? This guy actually might be hurt.\"\\nAs it turns out, he threw his final big-league pitch in 2006. The Cubs let him go a year later. The Padres signed him. More surgery followed. Last week, Prior was cut loose.\\nHe is a 28-year-old has-been.\\nAlthough it has anything but a happy ending, his is among the most interesting stories of recent times. The cautionary tale to end all cautionary tales.\\nWhenever some young gun is compared to the all-time greats, I always think of Mark Prior.\\nAnd whenever a team drafts the next Can\\'t Miss Kid, I say: \"Hey, if Messiah Mark can miss, anybody can.\"\\nThe Balder Truth\\nPirates rookie Andrew McCutchen was so incredible Saturday - 4 hits, 4 runs, 3 HRs, 6 RBI - that he was honored as Future Red Sox Or Future Cub Of The Day.\\nTHE BALDEST TRUTH\\nI promise. I\\'ll never capitalize the \"w\" in Dewayne again.\\nThe White Sox media guide lists the now-famous Perfect Game Preserver as DeWayne Wise. So do the lineup sheets and press notes that the team publishes on game days. But Wise says he wants the \"w\" lower-cased.\\nHis wish is my command: Dewayne Wise, it is.\\nBy the way, I really would have been impressed had Wise preserved a perfect game for Mark Buehrle on Sunday against the Yankees. Considering that Buehrle allowed seven runs on 12 hits in 4 1/3 innings, the Sox would have needed about 14 Dewaynes on the field (and maybe a couple on the other side of the outfield wall).\\nYou know, there\\'s only one word to describe this latest Buehrle performance: aWful.',\n",

       " {'text': 'RADIO, THEN AND NOW\\n- Radio people, talking about sincerity.\\nWhat a concept.\\nMy friend Jaye Albright, one of the leading country radio consultants, asks in her blog today, could there be a trend afoot, away from sarcasm, toward sincerity? Ever the radio implementer, Jaye asks, in a Facebook post, “Does uplifting material create more buzz than sarcasm?” You can read her post here. I was moved to comment in Facebook: I said: ”As long as radio people assume human on-air behavior, like music, is just another ratings-meter button, and format it, snark will rule those stations that seek the 18-34 male rock-n-roll demo, along with their warped and narrow view of what all younger people are like. Life is different. Moods, sarcastic and sincere, are all out there, mostly in balance. People who are only one thing — whether exuding syrupy optimism or seething with cynicism — don’t make authentic friends. Imagine a radio station with real people, as opposed to hyperthyroid, stand-up-comic, buzz-inducing readers. That would be something. Gee. I sound snarky. Don’t worry, it’s just a passing mood.”\\n- Pandora.com — the new music radio.\\nSorry about that fan-boy futurist headline. Radio people have had enough of such obituarial provocations, I’m sure. But…if you’re part of radio’s research-ratings-driven music complex, just read this New York Times report on Pandora, which started out, not as an advertising play, but a music-discovery machine. Not so suddenly, Pandora has become a $50 million-a-year success. The Web empowers the user — they call them users, not “listeners.” See if you don’t feel the hot breath of change on the back of your neck. [LINK]\\n- I’m back again.\\nI just got mad all over again about what’s happened to radio. So I’m gonna post again here, occasionally. American commercial broadcast radio is still producing cash flow, while it struggles to refinance its ridiculously bankrupt, failed stock-play business model. Meanwhile its still-profitable-but-hopelessly irrelevant operating model loses skin cells by the trillions every broadcast minute. There’s even talk in the government of repossessing TV channels to convert all that outdated and inefficient use of bandwidth to digital broadband service — can all those fat radio licenses be far behind? In Canada, radio licensees are actually turning in their AM licenses to the government and shutting down the stations that they’ve operated for nearly a century. It’s way too late for radio people to wake up and start distributing some kind of audio programming to the Web, which is currently the only conceivable way to get into all cellphones or other digital devices. But…even though it’s late, there’s still time. Will radio people survive the digital tsunami? Stay tuned. Or not.\\n- Bankruptcy. Why not?\\nPresident Obama has announced a save-Chrysler plan that includes a bankruptcy filing. Gasp. But wait. This bankruptcy is part of a plan in which virtually all of Chrysler’s stakeholders (love that word), the people, banks, and organizations who have a stake in the survival and success of Chrysler, are volunteering to take a huge hit, making huge sacrifices, to allow the company to survive. How about bankruptcy as the solution to the radio industry mess? Radio is a healthy, viable, operating business. It hasn’t been destroyed yet by the Internet and the IPod. It’s the debt-burden imposed by ten years of speculative trafficking in stations that’s done it in. Radio needs a massive swamp-draining. Like the equity speculators who’re going to take a bath in the Chrysler bankruptcy, the overinflated gamblers who have lived high on their fees and commissions while creating a frail, unmanageable financial balloon for American radio, should be forced to make their contribution to its revival. Bankruptcy is the answer. Let’s follow the Chrysler model, and surgically remove the speculators. We need to find a whole new generation of local businesspeople to take on their town’s radio stations. But, I assure you, the price will be right.\\n- Another purge day for radio, and a touch of hope.\\nClear Channel Radio, the General Motors of the radio station business, axed more employees today. As Jerry Del Colliano, the Jeremiah of radio, pointed out this week, CC is beating the drum for what they say is their “local” campaign, while chopping local station staffs and increasing the delivery of networked radio shows from out of town. Radio was constructed to be a hometown electronic medium. Radio station people have been running as hard as they can from that model for decades — it isn’t all the fault of CC and the other consolidators — standardizing programming through imitation. Radio people love to talk about being local, but they really always preferred to simplify the lives of their sales departments. Ratings technology required standardization. One piece of news caught my eye today — the CEO of a medium-sized station owner, New Northwest Broadcasters, announced he was leaving his job today, taking the company’s Billings, Montana, stations with him. This could be a signal that the company has a plan to sell off all their stations. They named their CFO — that’s the company numbers freak — to lead the company. You don’t put the head accountant in charge if you’re planning to run your stations creatively. I take this as a hopeful sign, that the radio speculators are getting ready to cut their losses and liquidate. Can’t happen fast enough for me. Maybe there’s a new generation of people who actually love radio who’ll see the opportunity and step up. There’s time to do it; listeners still love and listen to radio, even though the corporate stockbrokers have debased and demoralized the business by treating it like a burger chain rather than a powerful local medium. But now I’m just ranting. Later.\\n- Preston Trombley. Best Classical Host\\nI haven’t heard them all, but for me, Preston Trombley is the gold standard of classical radio hosts. Fortunately or unfortunately, depending on your point of view, he’s only heard on SiriusXM satellite radio, on the “Symphony Hall” channel. He’s a composer himself, and he speaks with the voice of a deep familiar. Not only of music, but as a familiar friend to the listener. You don’t have to sound haughty to be taken seriously on classical radio. SiriusXM has a couple of voices who do. Preston is casual, friendly, witty, fun to be around. He makes me glad to be paying to hear him.\\n- On the Road with SiriusXM, and Fear\\nOnly a few years ago, the radio business quaked in fear of satellite radio. It wasn’t quaking, exactly, about Internet radio. It was too busy shivering in the IPod cold. Of course, American radio had already frozen out the (new) music business, hurting itself much more than the ‘Pod ever could, but that’s another story. Radio should have seen that satellite was going to be a no-commercials version of its own flawed self, and would have its own problems getting even hardcore (Stern) radio fans to pay for the same-old. Now that accelerated Armageddon has arrived, Sirius-plus-XM has bigger problems than the two of them alone had, which was not the way the merger was supposed to work, and the media-blackbirds are starting to circle the satellite, which is a good trick.

The physicality of such an object - hand-scribbled notes, clumsily placed postage stamps, damage incurred in shipment - carries a rich narrative and establishes a profound, interpersonal connection that simply cannot exist in cyberspace.\\nAs members of the Postcard Collective, we find many forms of value in making postcards for each other. They provide us with a new audience for our work; they challenge us to think differently about our studio practice; they serve as an opportunity to test new ideas and, in turn, inform our artistic endeavors outside the Collective. While we continue to participate in The Postcard Collective for different reasons, we are all driven by an undeniable human need to connect with others and stretch the limits of our creativity.\\nMotivated by an intrinsic human desire to share experience, our mission is to build and maintain a network of individuals who seek to share their art with each other in the form of postcards, to open up a direct line of communication between artists, and to promote a sense of camaraderie and connectedness throughout the Collective.\\nMembers of the Postcard Collective are automatically accepted into our seasonal postcard exchanges and a private discussion list intended to facilitate community growth.

Bedford/St. Martins, 2013.\\nEnglish 240: World Literature\\nIntroduction to Modern World Dramatic Literature—Realism and After\\nDr. Tom Crochunis | MW 2:00 - 3:15\\nIn this course, we will read plays first performed in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, focusing on realism’s emergence as a strategy in Western drama, on varied ways of adapting realistic dramaturgy in relationship to other cultural traditions, and on the intellectual and cultural sources that lead dramatists to extend beyond realism. Students in the class need not begin the course with an extensive background in reading drama. Plays read for the course will include works by European, Asian, African, and North and South American writers that either define or serve to extend the strategies of theatrical realism. We will engage with the course’s plays through careful reading, viewing, discussion, writing, and in some cases performing or theatrically envisioning scenes. Major course assignments will include two short (4-6 page) papers engaging with individual plays and their critical reception, regular short in-class writing assignments, and one longer comparative study and presentation that connects a play read for the course to other plays that preceded or followed it.\\nEnglish 243: Art of the Film\\nDr. Michael Pressler | M 12:00-12:50, W 12:00-1:50, F 12:00-12:50\\nEnglish 245: Women\\'s Literature\\nDr . Laurie Cella | TR 9:30 - 10:45\\nEducation 290: Introduction to English Language Arts\\nDr. Erica Galioto | TR 8:00 - 9:15\\nThis course offers Secondary English certification students their foundation in English/Language Arts education. As the first of three pedagogy courses, Introduction to ELA Education provides students with necessary background on the teaching profession and the fundamentals of educational and adolescent psychology and then moves to a more specific focus on the secondary ELA classroom. Students will be introduced to the philosophical beliefs and practical realities of American education (with a special focus on middle and high schools), the array of learning and development theories that inform effective educators, and the range of effective literacy practices involved in ELA teaching and learning at the secondary level. Curriculum, student diversity, assessment, technology, differentiation, and classroom management are some of the topics that will be explored both generally and then with an ELA focus as students work toward becoming reflective collaborative decision-makers. Readings, assignments, and practical demonstrations will provide students with an opportunity to engage with theory and research that will be relevant to their future coursework and eventual middle and high school ELA classrooms. Our primary concern will be the joining of theory about teaching and learning with the practical methods of implementing such theory in a secondary classroom. This course is a prerequisite for ENG-426: Teaching Adolescent Literature and EDU-422: Teaching English in the Secondary Schools.\\nEnglish 304: Literary Criticism\\nDr. William Harris | TR 5:00 - 6:15\\nEnglish 308: Poetry Writing\\nDr. Nicole Santalucia | TR 2:00 - 3:15\\nEnglish 308: Fiction Writing\\nProf. Neil Connelly | MWF 12:00 - 12:50\\nDuring the first half of the semester, students will be introduced to key concepts of narrative through lectures, readings, and sometimes unusual exercises. All of this will lead toward the creation of an original literary short story. The second half of the semester is dedicated to workshopping these pieces, with each student having a day dedicated to his/her fiction. No prerequisite save the desire to write compelling stories.\\nEnglish 330: Shakespeare\\nDr. Deborah Montuori | TR 11:00 - 12:15\\nEnglish 335: Creative Nonfiction Writing\\nDr. Kim Van Alkemade | TR 5:00 - 6:45\\nEnglish 336: Theories and Approaches\\nDr. Shannon Mortimore-Smith | W 6:30 - 9:15\\nEnglish 358: Ethnic Literature\\nDr. Raymond Janifer TR 12:30 - 1:45\\nEnglish 376: Studies in Medieval Literature\\nDr. Shari Horner | MWF 11:00 - 12:15\\nEnglish 378: Studies in Early American Literature\\nDr. William Harris | TR 2:00 - 3:15\\nEnglish 380: Studies in 19th Century British Literature\\nDr: Catherine Dibello - TR 11:00 - 12:15\\nNineteenth-century Britain witnessed an extraordinary increase in the number of women writers. While some of these women achieved great commercial success, many also faced hostile critics who either dismissed their work as trivial or objected to their treatment of taboo topics and creation of unconventional heroines. In this course, we will analyze four novels by women (Jane Austen\\'s Pride and Prejudice, Charlotte Bronte\\'s Jane Eyre, Emily Bronte\\'s Wuthering Heights, and George Eliot\\'s Middlemarch) and read secondary sources in which nineteenth-century and more recent critics respond to these books. This student-centered course emphasizes discussion and includes a paper, an annotated bibliography, a final essay exam, and an oral report.\\nEnglish 381: Studies in 19th Century American Literature Dr. Erica Galioto |TR 9:30 - 10:45\\nDuplicates, Dupes, and Deceptions: Unacknowledged Doubleness in the 19th Century will examine the concepts of identity, identification, and knowledge through their related presentation in nineteenth-century American fiction. Our central focus will be to analyze works of fiction through the lens of the following questions: How is identity formed? How do we communicate that identity to others? To what extent can we identify with another’s experience? Is reading an experience of easy identification? Is it ever possible to know the self or an other (whether actual or fictional) completely? How do we come to know anything at all? We will begin by studying double internal identity in Nathaniel Hawthorne’s The House of Seven Gables (1851) and Edgar Allen Poe’s The Narrative of A. Gordon Pym of Nantucket (1838). Next, we will analyze the external performance of identity in Mark Twain’s Puddn’head Wilson (1894) and Herman Melville’s “Benito Cereno” (1856). Finally, we will complicate the effectiveness of sentimentalism in Harriet Beecher Stowe’s Uncle Tom’s Cabin (1852) and Hannah Crafts’s The Bondwoman’s Narrative (18?). We will move from one canonical text to the other based on how each internally displays manifestations of flawed identification and externally disrupts the reader’s own sense of seamless identification. Students in this course will also be exposed to criticism and psychoanalytic theory related to the fiction and the concept of identification. Three papers and one presentation are required, as well as periodic written responses and active discussion.\\nEducation 422: Methods of Teaching English in Secondary Schools Dr. Thomas Crochunis | W: 8-10:50 AM\\n“Methods” aims to prepare you for the experience of student teaching, and beyond that for the work of being an early career teacher. Our course will center on several essential questions:\\n* What does it mean to teach English in a contemporary American secondary school setting? What are the conceptual, practical, and personal dimensions of the job? How does one do it well?\\n* What roles does an effective teacher need to play to make the classroom, the school, and the community in which s/he teaches places where young people can learn what reading and writing have to teach them?\\n* What happens in classrooms and schools—educationally, socially, culturally? What can we learn from observing, investigating what we see and hear, and reading about issues in contemporary education?\\n* How do young people develop as readers and writers? What can teachers do to lead their students beyond the required skills they need to achieve to open their minds to the potential power of reading and writing in their lives?\\nActivities and projects we will engage in during the course include the following:\\n* Extended field observations and collaborations on teaching in varied school settings\\n* Research into a teaching approach that seems likely to be useful in your student teaching placement\\n* A series of planning assignments that lead to planning of a unit or set of extended learning sequences for your student teaching experience\\n* Regular collaboration with classroom and practitioner peers in planning, leading classroom experiences, and analyzing problems of English teaching practice\\n* In-depth reading and thinking about English teaching generally, writing development and teaching, and the interaction between standards, reading, and literature\\nNOTE: In order to take full advantage of the field experiences that are part of the Methods class, you are strongly advised to schedule as few classes as possible in the mornings (8-12) of your Methods semester.\\nEnglish 426: Teaching Adolescent Literature Dr. Shannon Mortimore-Smith\\n| TR 12:30 - 1:45\\nEnglish 428: Advanced Fiction Workshop\\nProf. Neil Connelly - MWF 12:00 - 12:50\\nOpen only to those who have successfully completed English 308, this course opens with a series of directed writing prompts but moves swiftly to workshop, when each student contributes his/her own fiction for the class\\'s consideration. The class concludes with a week long discussion of publishing.\\nEnglish 464: Seminar in Major Author\\nDr. Cathy Dibello | TR 9:30 - 10:45\\nAlthough Jane Austen wrote her novels two centuries ago, they remain remarkably popular. In fact, the past twenty years have seen a dramatic increase in Austen\\'s popularity, as evidenced by the many films and television adaptations, \"sequels,\" and the new editions of the novels themselves. What explains Austen\\'s enduring appeal? To answer this question, we will read five of Austen\\'s novels and the critical articles in Jane Austen in Hollywood. In addition, we will watch clips from various video versions of Austen\\'s books. As we analyze differences between the novels and the recent film adaptations, we will speculate about what these changes indicate about the nature of film and our own culture.\\nRequired Texts: Austen\\'s Sense and Sensibility, Pride and Prejudice, Mansfield Park, Emma, and Persuasion. Troost and Greenfield\\'s Jane Austen in Hollywood (2nd ed.).\\nRequired Activities: Analytical paper, annotated bibliography, oral report on an article, video presentation, daily work\\nEnglish 490: Selected Topics in English\\nDr. William Harris | TR 2:00 - 3:15',\n",

Although originally designed for use by novice musicians or first time synth-buyers, the CS01 has been recognized by today's electronic musicians as one fat little bass machine with simple controls. In a nutshell, the CS01 is simple to use and edit but still has some great features for any situation. It's tiny and portable, it has baby-sized keys and it can run on batteries, and there is a built-in amplifier and speaker which is quite fun.\\nAs for sounds and synthesizing, the CS01 is the perfect monosynth for bubbly and growling bass! It features a very nice 12dB resonant voltage-controlled filter. In addition to the oscillators' sine and square type waveforms there is PWM and noise. There are also LFO controls, glissando (like portamento), a typical ADSR envelope generator, pitch & mod wheels and even a breath controller input. A CS01 mkII (pictured below) was later released by Yamaha soon after the original. It featured an improved 24dB resonant VCF (filter) with adjustable slider control over resonance instead of switchable on/off resonance as found on the original. The CS01 mkII is also identifiable by its black case with green letters.\\nYamaha CS01 II\\nThe CS01 may look simple or toy-like but it is still able to create cool little analog bass blips, bass lines and bass bubbles that are just perfect for today's electronic musicians.

       " {'text': 'Ric Roman Waugh, 2013\\n\"Be honest with yourself. You can\\'t raise Ceci alone, you can\\'t handle it.\"\\nDark Water comes labeled “Japanese horror,” a subgenre with an American reputation that is decidedly mixed, and now leaning toward negative. But the movie, a remake of a Hideo Nakata thriller by Brazilian director Walter Salles, is beholden to none of the genre conventions. Indeed, Dark Water is hardly a horror movie at all; instead, Salles and his screenwriter, Rafael Yglesias, have crafted a surpassingly lovely character drama that exists independent of any genre trappings that happen to tag along. It’s a beautiful, beautiful film, one so expressive that you run out of adjectives to describe it and are reduced to repeating “beautiful” and “lovely” over and over. Rarely do I become this purely involved in a movie.\\nThe first act of Dark Water — roughly forty minutes — is so compelling in its somber, carefully observed ordinariness, that when the ghost story finally rears its head (however gently), it almost seems like an intrusion. We meet Dahlia (Jennifer Connelly), a recently divorced mother, whose ex (Dougray Scott) has vowed to wage a bitter fight for custody of their daughter Ceci (Ariel Gade). Dahlia and Ceci move into a ramshackle Roosevelt Island apartment building, which is under the questionable auspices of Mr. Murray (John C. Reilly), the landlord, and Veeck (Pete Postlethwaite), the handyman. They settle in, Ceci goes to school, Dahlia looks for a job, all before anything really “happens,” at least in the sense promised by the slam-bang trailer.\\nDoes this make Dark Water sound slow, or meandering, or — God forbid — deceptive? Maybe, but the movie is so intricately constructed that the experience of watching it is nothing less than entrancing. The beauty of the lengthy set-up is that it doesn’t feel like set-up at all (with the possible exception of one scene in which Murray demonstrates the indestructibility of the bathtub plexiglass); it feels like a careful, compelling introduction to two people for whom we immediately feel affection. It’s wonderful, gentle character work, and I got lost in the relationship between Dahlia and Ceci, the meticulously rendered dank New York locale, and the almost impossibly lyrical way the film has of flowing from line to line, shot to shot, scene to scene. We do, all the while, get hints of building suspense and the sense that all will probably not be well for very much longer, but this is more of a general, holistic impression than a byproduct of a foreboding soundtrack and a series of jolts.\\nI will grant the inevitable assertion that the ghost story that finally gets rolling about an hour into the film is fairly conventional, and its outcome unsurprising. But what I do not think is conventional is the way that Dark Water keeps said ghost story firmly in the background, never letting it take the reins from the film’s human dimension. The plot is never framed in terms of the literal progression of the supernatural storyline, as most thrillers would be (i.e. with the focus trained on the characters reacting to the ghosts, or what have you); instead, we see everything from the perspective of Dahlia’s descent into abject desperation and what may or may not be madness.\\nI will admit, also, to becoming frustrated with the movie in its final minutes, when I found myself pleading with it to end on a grace note instead of launching into a horror set piece. If Salles had cut the last two minutes, which contain something hideously out-of-place, we would have been dealing with the best film of the year. Had he cut all the sensationalism of the last ten, it gets even better. But if the film does finally succumb to its baser instincts, it gets dragged there kicking and screaming. Even in the last act, Dark Water takes time out for character moments — I love how the kind lawyer (Tim Roth) is set up as a lonely man who lies about having a family (we see him tell Dahlia that he is at the movies with his family, after which he goes back into the theater and takes his seat alone in his row), but this doesn’t necessarily need to have any sort of direct plot-based payoff later on.\\nOn the way there, it turns into one of the year’s greatest technical accomplishments, a virtually flawless audio-visual masterwork. It moves with such ease and grace that you sink into it, lose yourself, forget where you are and what you have to do after the movie ends. It’s helped by a phenomenal turn from Jennifer Connelly, whom I’ve tended to find rather mopey in the past; she’s absolutely perfect here. I urge those who may otherwise be turned off by the “Japanese horror” buzz to give Dark Water a try. You may be surprised. >\\n-- Eugene Novikov\\n|Starring:||Ariel Gade, Jennifer Connelly, Pete Postlethwaite, John C. Reilly, Dougray Scott, Tim Roth|\\n|Directed by:||Walter Salles|',\n",

       " {'text': 'Week 11 NFL preview\\nCLICK TO REACT\\nBuffalo Bills at Cincinnati Bengals\\nIt\\'s been a tough go for the T.O. and Ocho show of late, especially with quarterback Carson Palmer throwing easily pickable airballs to enemy defenses. But if Palmer can\\'t get it to his No. 1 and No. 2 receivers against this defense, Marvin Lewis might want to consider benching Palmer for his younger brother, Jordan - the Bills rank 28th in Defensive DVOA against No. 1 and No. 2 receivers. One thing is for sure - the Bengals won\\'t miss right tackle Andre Smith, who\\'s been put on the shelf for the rest of the season with a foot injury, raising further questions about his ability to stay healthy and in shape. Smith gave up two sacks in just four starts this season.\\nDetroit Lions at Dallas Cowboys\\nCowboys quarterback Jon Kitna had best be aware against the Lions\\' front four - he was able to hang in the pocket and burn the Giants deep in an upset win last week, but the Lions have the NFL\\'s most quarterback hits this season (35), and they rank seventh in Football Outsiders\\' Adjusted Sack Rate metric. If you want to know why defensive tackle Ndamukong Suh is running away with the Defensive Rookie of the Year award, this is a good place to start. The Cowboys have allowed 33 hits this season, but just six in the three weeks that Kitna\\'s been a starter in place of Tony Romo.\\nWashington Redskins at Tennessee Titans\\nThe challenges don\\'t get any easier for Redskins safety LaRon Landry after his debacle against the Eagles\\' deep passing game. As we\\'ve detailed before, the Titans\\' Vince Young has the best average pass length this season (11.87 yards per) and he\\'s second behind Pittsburgh\\'s Ben Roethlisberger in average pass length per completion (8.94). However, Young has just 11 \"big plays\" (completed passes of 25 yards or more), while NFL leader Philip Rivers has 32. Still, with a week of game tape of the Redskins\\' deep pass defense and Randy Moss in his arsenal, don\\'t be surprised if Young airs it out to an extreme degree. If he doesn\\'t, he can always hand off to Chris Johnson, who can make tracks against a Washington front seven that ranks 29th in Defensive Adjusted Line Yards.\\nArizona Cardinals at Kansas City Chiefs\\nThe Chiefs have experienced quite the little freefall after their hot start. In just the last two weeks, Todd Haley\\'s team has dropped from first to 15th in Football Outsiders\\' DVOA rankings, and their chances of making the playoffs, based on advanced efficiency metrics, has dropped from 94.2 percent to 48.0 percent. Even Jamaal Charles, who\\'s been one of the game\\'s most efficient running backs, managed just 2.9 yards per carry in a 49-29 beat-down against the Denver Broncos. Perhaps the Chiefs should get Charles going more often in first down - despite having just 127 carries this year, Charles has 478 of his 760 yards on first down, and that comes in just 67 carries (a 7.6 yards-per-carry average). Charles is also a hot starter in the first quarter; in fact, his highest YPC totals and all of his touchdowns come on first-down, first-quarter situations.\\nGreen Bay Packers at Minnesota Vikings\\nThe Vikings currently have the NFL\\'s worst giveaway/takeway ratio at -11, but that\\'s not on running back Adrian Peterson. After fumbling four, nine, and six times in his first three regular seasons, Peterson hasn\\'t fumbled once this season. The problem, obviously, resides with Brett Favre, who has thrown 16 picks through nine games after giving the ball away just seven times through the air in 2009. Add in his three fumbles, and you have to wonder how much good Favre is doing his team at this point. Green Bay\\'s Aaron Rodgers has a team with a +6 balance on the turnover side (tied for fourth-best in the league), and he\\'s right in line with just nine picks and no fumbles. Part of Favre\\'s problem is that he\\'s been hit in the pocket 34 times, the most among all NFL quarterbacks.\\nHouston Texans at New York Jets\\nOne of the week\\'s best matchups will be Houston\\'s running game against the Jets\\' front seven. Rex Ryan\\'s defense ranks first in Defensive Adjusted Line Yards, allowing just 3.3 running back yards per carry. Meanwhile, Houston\\'s Arian Foster is the NFL\\'s most efficient and productive runner on a cumulative and per-play basis, per our advanced numbers. Quarterback Matt Schaub has been dealing with knee injuries this week, which could put the Jets in more eight-in-the-box situations. However, with Darrelle Revis still recovering from injuries and a case of contractitis early this season, the Jets rank 15th in Defensive DVOA against No. 1 receivers, and 27th against No. 2 receivers.\\nOakland Raiders at Pittsburgh Steelers\\nAll of a sudden, we have to look at the Oakland Raiders and wonder if they could pop up and win a very weak AFC West. The offense is humming along rather nicely with Jason Campbell and Darren McFadden, and the defense is performing at a Top 10 level despite shutdown corner Nnamdi Asomugha being in and out of the lineup over the last month. On the other hand, if you have Raiders tight end Zach Miller in your fantasy lineup and Miller overcomes his recent foot injury, see if you can manage to start him twice - especially if cornerback William Gay is lined up over him. Last week against the Patriots, Gay was beaten outright on two of the three touchdowns caught by rookie tight end Rob Gronkowski, and he was slow to cover on the other one. Ben Roethlisberger\\'s main problem will be pass protection; the Raiders bring their first-overall Adjusted Sack Rate against a patchwork offensive line that has looked awful in recent games.\\nBaltimore Ravens at Carolina Panthers\\nWe know that Carolina\\'s offense is nothing to worry about, especially with quarterback Brian St. Pierre and running back Mike Goodson as injury replacements, but it\\'s time to give a few kudos to one underrated Panthers defender. Linebacker James Anderson, a third-round pick in 2006, currently leads all NFL defenders in Football Outsiders\\' Defeats metric (plays that prevent positive plays and short-yardage conversion), and he ranks third in Successes (based on conversion percentage and incompletions/interceptions) behind Pittsburgh\\'s Lawrence Timmons and Tennessee\\'s Stephen Tulloch.\\nCleveland Browns at Jacksonville Jaguars\\nThe Browns hear it a lot - they\\'re the best 3-6 team in the NFL, and they\\'re probably sick and tired of it. Moral victories don\\'t get you very far. However, there\\'s statistical proof that it is indeed so. The Browns currently rank 14th in overall efficiency, and their Estimated Wins total (a figure based on efficiency metrics) is 5.0. Meanwhile, the 5-4 Jaguars rank 22nd in team efficiency, and their Estimated Wins total is 3.9. Moral of the story: The won-loss total tells you where a team is in the standings, but it doesn\\'t tell you where a team is going, how it got there, or how lucky/unlucky they are. Last week, the Jags won a game on the most improbable Hail Mary you\\'ll ever see, and the Browns lost a game with just seconds left in overtime.\\nTampa Bay Buccaneers at San Francisco 49ers\\nEvery quarterback has his security blanket of a receiver. For Troy Smith, who has started the last two 49ers games, that man has been tight end DeLanie Walker. Often obscured by Vernon Davis as a pure pass-catcher, Walker has amassed nine catches for 165 yards in those last two games after picking up just seven passes for 65 yards with Alex Smith under center. The Bucs\\' defense is about league average against tight ends, ranking 16th in Defensive DVOA against that position.\\nSeattle Seahawks at New Orleans Saints\\nWith Reggie Bush back in the Saints\\' lineup for the first time since Week 2, the Seahawks\\' defense finds itself in a bit of a poke. With Bush lining up all over the place, New Orleans\\' offense becomes much more multi-dimensional. Drew Brees has managed to keep the passing game afloat, but with Bush and Pierre Thomas out at various times with injuries, the Saints have had just three productive rushing days per FO\\'s opponent-adjusted DVOA efficiency metrics. Seattle\\'s run defense received a boost when defensive tackle Brandon Mebane returned from a calf injury last week, but Seattle\\'s linebackers will be tested against this particular rushing attack, especially with Aaron Curry being used more as an edge rusher or blitz addition in certain packages.\\nAtlanta Falcons at St. Louis Rams\\nFalcons quarterback Matt Ryan will have to keep a sharp eye on Rams defensive end Chris Long (son of Howie). One week after demolishing 49ers right tackle Anthony Davis, Long will go up against right tackle Tyson Clabo, who\\'s already allowed four sacks this season after giving up four all of last season. Long already has 5.5 sacks - add nine quarterback hits to that total, and it\\'s clear that he\\'s developed into one of the best pure pass-rushers in the league. He\\'s had at least one sack in each of his last four games, and he\\'s one of many reasons that the Rams\\' defense is surprising people this season.\\nIndianapolis Colts at New England Patriots\\nThe Patriots\\' passing offense may be more conservative this season, with more two-tight end sets and Randy Moss out of the picture, but that doesn\\'t mean it\\'s more consistent in one particular area. With a litter of young receivers, Tom Brady has experienced the highest number of receiver drops in the league with 27. Colts quarterback Peyton Manning is undergoing a similar experience with a young group of receivers in his injury-plagued offense - Indianapolis ranks third in receiver drops behind the aforementioned Patriots and the Detroit Lions. The classic Patriots-Colts matchups of yore, with the two best quarterbacks on earth leading precision aerial attacks, may now come down to the short-yardage efforts of underrated running backs - the Colts\\' Javarris James (the cousin of former Indy great Edgerrin James), and New England\\'s BenJarvus Green-Ellis.\\nNY Giants at Philadelphia Eagles\\nWhen facing the Michael Vick-led Eagles offense, one must look hard for signs of encouragement. Here\\'s one: It seems that if you force the Eagles to run the ball, they\\'re not very good at it after a while. Philly has the NFL\\'s best yards per carry in rushing attempts 1-10 per game (5.8), but fall to 20th (3.8) on carries 11-20, and 29th (0.0) from 21 on. No mystery there - when the Eagles are trying to establish a lead, Vick\\'s more likely to make a designed run, especially if his reads are covered, and he\\'s run 10 times or more in just two games. Also, LeSean McCoy\\'s per-carry average drops a full yard from 1-10 to 11-20 - from 5.0 to 4.0. So, hang in there, Giants ... perhaps slowing this offense down is just a matter of time?\\nMonday, November 22\\nDenver Broncos at San Diego Chargers\\nMike Vick may have taken some of the steam out of Philip Rivers\\' MVP candidacy, but there\\'s no denying the season Rivers is having. We already detailed his ability to make big plays with an undermanned receiver corps; he\\'s also going to be a major problem for any defense at home, where he\\'s completing over 72 percent of his throws. Of course, let\\'s not sleep on Denver\\'s Kyle Orton - right now, Orton ranks first overall in cumulative opponent-adjusted quarterback efficiency, and he ranks third in per-play production. Denver \"superczar\" Josh McDaniels has his faults as a personnel man, but he does know how to build offenses in which quarterbacks can succeed beyond their wildest dreams - remember that he was the man behind the Patriots\\' all-time 2007 passing game.',\n",

A fair deal more than a Heine can or even the BPL Firelite and its cousins. This means you'd need to make your burner meet this diameter at least, adding a good deal of weight to the stove (although we're talking a couple ozs here) and probably also adding a huge fuel capacity that just wouldn't be appropriate for the amount of water you'd be heating.\\nSecond, in my opinion a taller-narrower form factor is much more packable. Just me.\\nThird, though this is just guesswork, with all your heat concentrated on the periphery of a pot that's already quite wide, you may end up getting very uneven heating. In a taller and narrower pot, where the major axis is height, convection currents in the water do most of the mixing (and therefore heat transfer) for you. Since the major axis of the ti bowl is width, and all your heat with the CFV stove would be on the edge, you may end up boiling the periphery several minutes before the center and just waiting for conduction and mixing to happen on its own to bring the center to a boil . . . which could be a little inefficient.\",\n",

       " {'text': 'There is an old saying that I have heard quite a bit: \"Curiosity killed the cat.\" What people forget is cats have nine lives. Without curiosity, we cannot learn. If we do not learn, there is no knowledge to conceive. Knowledge is something that I crave. In my view, knowledge is the central dogma to becoming successful in life. Some of the knowledge that I have learned at The Elkhart Truth — such as in AP style, the order in stories should be time, day, location — will certainly help me with my future goals in life.\\nThe science behind knowledge is curiosity; understand that people make mistakes. With the mistakes that are made, there are lessons to be learned. Lessons that give insight on a certain subject. Think of riding a bike. At first, there are issues with balance. More likely than not, there will be a few scrapes and bruises from falling. The fall that scares the daylights out of you as your front tire wobbles back and forth right before your elbow meets the pavement. Determination then kicks in. With determination, we keep riding that bike. We learn how the bumps on the road may feel, how to avoid pot holes and much more. Learning how to ride a bike is similar to learning in life.\\nWith learning comes goals. Goals help see through the main subject you are trying to learn. Goals break the subject down into smaller areas. Learning is like building a bicycle. A bike is in parts. The only thing you have to refer to are the instructions. You start out looking at the instructions. Looking on how the structure is formed. Without structure, a bike will fall to pieces. Just as a paragraph would not flow correctly. As you continue to build a bike you refer back to the instructions constantly, likewise, making sure there are no errors in grammar or in style in writing. You begin to get the gist of which part goes to which socket. You still make errors, so you still look back at the instructions to see what mistakes you made. Eventually, the bike is fully operational. You take the bike out for a ride and begin to feel how smooth it flows. How the sentences come together with the proper grammar and punctuation. How the style fits so well with what you have written like a chain on a gear. Here and there you may need to make a few repairs, but you have memorized how it all comes together. This is similar with life, except that there is no instruction sheet. The goals must be made by you.\\nTake me as an example. I am a high school graduate who plans to help the world with my words by writing inspirational poetry, for the old and young, around the globe. I have planned out how to reach these goals. I understand that it takes quite the talent have work published. For support, I have decided to take hold of my technological niche and pursue the field of technology at Ivy Tech. This will give me a foundation to support myself upon. Once I see that moving forward with my writing career is fit, I plan to go to college for creative writing and journalism. With that experience and education, I will to publish some of my work.\\nFrom that point on, it is my decisions on how my life shall end up. Whether it is what I expected or not, I shall make the best of it.',\n",

       " {'text': 'Li Songsong EXHIBITED AT THE SAATCHI GALLERY\\nOil on canvas\\n180 x 300 cm (diptych)\\nIn Gift, Li’s expressionistic painting utilises the devices of photography to allude to the deceptive qualities of images. Picturing Chinese fighters parading a shot down enemy airplane during the second Sino-Japanese war, Li renders the scene as a purely aesthetic experience, supplanting historical connotation with his own legacy of artistic production. Mirroring the original documentary photo, Li’s black and white palette concentrates attention on the formal techniques of the painting; the scene becomes secondary to Li’s seductive brushwork, as ’fact’ becomes disembodied into a malleable network of fluid, loose gestures. The right side of the image has been slightly enlarged to force a comparative study of the image, underscoring the subjectivity of represented ’truth’.\\nOil on canvas\\n170 x 210 cm\\nLi’s The Decameron takes its title from a novel written by Giovanni Boccaccio in the mid-14th century; structured as a frame narrative the book is a collection of 100 stories told by ten characters over a period of ten days, creating not one continuous plot, but a medley of tales surrounding set themes. In Li’s painting, Boccaccio’s literary structure is applied to dissemble and reinterpret a public source photo of the 2004 National People’s Congress. Elongating the original image then cutting it into 10 separate pieces, Li completed the painting in individually demarcated sections, each one a distortion and biased embellishment of an historical event.\\nThis Is How We Talk Politics\\nOil on canvas (diptych)\\n210 X 210 cm 100 x 245 cm 160 X 260 cm Overall dimensions: 260 x 470 cm\\nThemes of intimacy, remoteness, and anxiety run throughout Li’s work. His scenes gain a haunting uncanniness not from their place in social memory, but because of their intensely concentrated surfaces. Treating his loaded source material as a void template, Li approaches painting as a purely amoral intervention, a meditative engagement with the possibilities of personal significance within an increasingly virtual world. Li’s diptych This Is How We Talk Politics blurs this distinction between public and private. Its sumptuously textured panels paradoxically convey the speed, pixellation, and distortion of mass media as fixed and tangible matter. Thick impasto fields in greyscale loom like a concrete facade, gauged and pockmarked, stippled and annotated through Li’s obsessive gestures, creating an almost spiritual contemplation of beauty from the intrinsically impersonal and generic.\\nOil on aluminium panels\\n280 x 400cm\\nLi painted Cuban Sugar in 2006 at a time when China underwent a crisis in domestic sugar production, forcing it to engage in trade with Cuba to cut inflation. Li’s visualisation of this event is fractured, reflecting this ideological conflict of interest with an image that is not self-sustaining, but rather uncomfortably made up of a composite of independent sections. Executing his scene as a montage, each defined area operates as a painting within a painting, suggesting a layered and disjointed approach to historical interpretation, further complicated by Li’s intensely formal approach to his subject. Li offers no political opinion within his work, but focuses solely on the act of painting to open new relationships between individual perception and the authoritative narratives of documentation.',\n",

World Bank President Robert Zoellick is calling on the Group of 20 leading and emerging economies to put food first on its agenda.\\nThe World Bank\\'s latest food price index is just three percent below its 2008 peak. Wheat and maize prices have gone up about 75 percent since last June. According to report, wheat increased 54 percent in Kyrgyzstan, 45 percent in Bangladesh, 37 percent in Tajikistan, 33 percent in Mongolia, 31 percent in Sri Lanka, 19 percent in Afghanistan and 16 percent in both Sudan and Pakistan.\\nAccording to Zoellick, high and volatile food prices are a key challenge in the developing world, where the most vulnerable people spend more than half their income on food.\\n\"Even before these latest price hikes, there were already more than 900 million people going hungry each day,\" he says. \"Now, with an estimated 44 million more people living in extreme poverty, it shows this year is shaping up to be a very tough year for the chronically malnourished.\"\\nThis year is not as bad as 2008, when prices hit record highs. That\\'s because grain stocks are somewhat larger, maize harvests in Africa were good, and rice prices have not risen as much as other grains. But Zoellick says the upcoming growing season will be especially important.\\n\"We already are in stress points in a number of markets. If this trend continues, if we don\\'t get a relief on the weather side, then I foresee conditions getting worse. And, mistaken policy actions such as export bans and other types of price controls will just exacerbate the problem.\"\\nDrought in the Black Sea region cut Russia\\'s wheat harvest by a third in 2010. A subsequent ban on wheat exports drove prices up.\\nLast summer, Russia banned wheat exports after a major drought. Rice export bans were blamed for worsening price spikes in 2007 and 2008 that led to some food riots.\\nSpeaking ahead of this week\\'s G-20 finance ministers meeting in Paris, Zoellick discourages export bans and called for a global code of conduct that would at least exempt humanitarian shipments from restrictions.\\nHe believes high and unstable prices are likely to be a long-term trend, in part because of the rising demand for biofuels and the growing appetite for meat in developing countries.\\n\"What we\\'re now seeing is a trend punctuated by some great volatility,\" says Zoellick, \"and the poor and vulnerable have got no cushion when the prices spike.\"\\nTo help offset the problem, he\\'s calling for global action to provide better safety nets for pregnant women and young children and to improve developing-world farmers\\' access to better seeds, fertilizer and markets.',\n",

       " {'text': 'The book of Acts reveals the transition from Judaism to Christianity, from the prominence of the law to the expanse of grace. For Gaebelein, Acts represents the earliest moments whereby grace becomes the normative way by which we know God. Pay attention to Acts, he says, to understand grace.\\nGaebelein approaches the book of Acts apart from what Ford C. Ottman calls “the yoke of traditional interpretation” and removed from “the feverish discontent with the supernatural.” In particular, Gaebelein has little tolerance for the higher critics, whose attempts to domesticate the work of the Spirit obfuscate the primary purpose of the book. Gaebelein’s approach brings the work of the Spirit to the fore—especially the Spirit’s role of fulfilling the promises of Jesus. He also explains the ongoing tensions between Jewish expressions of Christianity and a wholesale Gentile embrace of the Gospel. The book of Acts, says Gaebelein, exhorts us toward greater faithfulness and bolder preaching, because the message of the Holy Spirit’s comfort is needed in all times and places. The Acts of the Apostles: An Exposition also includes an introduction, which includes Gaebelein’s outline of the book and a brief discussion about authorship and historicity.\\nPraise for the Print Edition\\nIt is my privilege to commend to the people of God… the volumes of Mr. A.

He was converted at an early age, and became ordained in the Methodist church in 1886. Gaebelein was a prolific writer. He wrote numerous books and tracts and served as editor of Our Hope, a Bible study magazine, for fifty-two years. He also co-edited the Scofield Reference Bible. Gaebelein devoted nearly ten years of his life to writing The Annotated Bible, a 3,000-page commentary on Scripture, also available from Logos. He also lectured frequently at Dallas Theological Seminary. Gaebelein died in 1945.',\n",

In an effort to eliminate any confusion about its reversal on SOPA though, Jones has removed blog postings that had outlined areas of the bill Go Daddy did support.\\n\"Go Daddy has always fought to preserve the intellectual property rights of third parties, and will continue to do so in the future,\" Jones said.\\nI would imagine that, for many, this will be too late, but as SOPA support continues to crumble, it\\'s going to make it very difficult for Congress to claim that this bill really has much support out in the real world.',\n",

How can you be truly bitter if you aren’t cheerful on occasion, just for the contrast?\\nThat being said, yes, I WAS glaring at you when you pulled up with your books one day last week. This is because we were undergoing what I have always called a “Surge” (I was using this twenty years ago, but I don’t have it trademarked, and its use by the military has nothing to do with us.) A surge occurs when, for no reason I can understand, everybody decides to donate books on the same day. I suppose the weather has something to do with it, and the number of times the Book Fair has been mentioned in the media, but these things don’t correlate perfectly. I have seen surges on days when the wind chill is about 9, and I have seen surges in the middle of October, when nobody’s really writing about the Book Fair at all.\\nI’ve never decided which surge is more annoying: when the books coming in have obviously been fished out of dumpsters behind junior college libraries or when they have come from some collector who is parting with the crown jewels. Last week we had the second kind.\\n“But that’s great!” you cry. “You want lots of good books, right?” Oh, my innocent little prunepit, let me tell you about it.\\nCar pulls up. “Got some books for you. My grandfather collected 19th century archery books.”\\n“Oh, that sounds good. Let’s get those seven boxes….”\\nSUV pulls up. “I have to clean out my house.

       " {'text': 'The following guest post was written by Kyle Moore. If you’d like to submit a guest post of your own, please get in touch!\\nWhen the original HTC EVO 4G came out two years ago, I had a regular flip phone. I thought, “Why is everyone so enamored by these smartphones?” But then I ended up preordering the EVO after reviewing everything it could do. I picked it up on launch day, and so began my life attached to a smartphone. I could do everything with that EVO: I watched movies on it, I browsed the web – it was easy to forget that I could also simply text or make phone calls. I Skyped on it, typed emails to friends, and used it for work emails as well. I thought it couldn’t get any better, but then I rooted it and started putting custom ROMs on it, flashing day and night.\\nLong story short, a year later, I was still paying that extra $10 premium data fee on my phone bill. I thought about how I use my WiFi a lot when I am at home and work, and wondered why I was paying Sprint so much each month. That sent me on a journey to find the cheapest wireless plan I could.\\nI originally stayed within the Sprint family and went to Boost Mobile, lured by the possibility of getting my bill down to $35 per month on a smartphone. But that meant I had to give up my sidekick, my EVO! (I didn’t want to mess with the potentially illegal prospect of changing my IMEI.)\\nI struggled at first with a less-capable smartphone, but soon adapted. However, I kept searching, wondering when someone would come out with a service that would let you use your WiFi at home, work, and wherever you could pick it up, and use the cell network on an as-needed basis. After all, I rarely talk while I am driving, and I certainly don’t text and drive – people have a hard enough time walking on a street while they are glued to their phone screens! I continued to hope that someone, someday would think that the big providers have it all wrong.\\nWell, just about two months ago, I ran across Ting. Ting is the revolution in wireless that I have been waiting for. It has a simple, straightforward pricing scheme, based precisely on how many minutes, texts, and megabytes you use – just what I was looking for. For a while, I just followed its blog and browsed its device offerings for a while, and since Ting uses the Sprint network, I thought that it might be a good option for me.\\nI have found that other companies either control your usage, or have you pay a lot of money for unlimited everything, which isn’t bad if you only use your phone for everything. But since I already pay for WiFi at home, and I have access at work, I thought that I might be able to get my bill down fairly low with Ting. In fact, if I didn’t have to make any calls while out and about, and relied on WiFi for data, VOIP calling, and texting, I could in theory have a $6 phone bill!\\nBut then Ting announced something even more intriguing: it was rolling out a BYOSD program (Bring Your Own Sprint Device), and it wanted some alpha testers! So I joined the Ting army as fast as I could, and so far it seems to me that Ting understands what people want from their providers: simple billing and pricing, no contracts, and use of all the features Google wants you to use without added cost (i.e. I can tether without paying Ting any extra fees).\\nI was actually included in the second round of testers, and the process was extremely easy. I was in constant contact with Ting while I was walked through the adoption process. I went into storage, pulled out my old EVO 4G, and fired it up. I simply had to reprogram two things using some ## commands on the phone dialer, and I had to know my MSL code. Before I knew it, my old EVO friend was back with me, resurrected from the dead!\\nNow, it is like I never left. EVO 4G ROMs are still just as amazing, and everything just works with Ting. I have tethering, I can still use 4G WiMAX, and best of all, I am now in control of my usage and my phone bill! I payed less than $15 to set myself up on the smallest options for voice, text, and data usages (100 minutes, 100 texts, 100 MB). I have sent three texts and made two phone calls, just to test out the service, and I used up just 37 MB of data. Even so, I haven’t changed my usage on the phone – I call over WiFi now, and it sounds the same as the regular cellular network – and sometimes even better. But I still I have full access to any service available through Sprint when I need it.\\nTing is also by far the best company I have ever worked with from a customer service standpoint. Everyone at Ting is genuinely excited about what they are doing, and so am I. For the first time, I feel that a company has placed the customer’s best interests first, and understands that they are revolutionizing the industry. I think that the pricing plans will change for the better as more customers see the promise and realize the benefits of being in control of their own usage.\\nFor the heavy mobile data user, it might not yet be time to try Ting, but for everyone else, the base plan is just $6 to have a phone. Your whole family can share your minute, text, and data buckets, and you have complete control over every phone. There is a great dashboard that tracks usage in real time, and you can limit usage on any line.\\nI hope it takes off, and I feel privileged to have been a part of the first test for BYOSD. Ting is also planning on expanding the ability to bring any device, but for now, even just allowing you to bring an old Sprint device is awesome.\\nThe above guest post was written by Kyle Moore.

Apparently some blonde steals their Humvee and we\\'ll catch up next week in Rahleigh for more of their exciting adventures!\\nIn a clip that is probably not supposed to be part of that last clip, but who can tell, anyway? Goldberg is posing for photos - Scott Steiner walks in and talks some smack, then leaves. Goldberg says one day he\\'s gonna beat him up or something.\\nWho\\'s next? You\\'re next! Next to play WCW/NWO THUNDER! on your PlayStation!\\nLast night on SuperBrawl, some stills were taken in the Piper/Hall United States title bout. \"Piper used the atomic drop, many other exciting moves...\" Oh shut up, Tony. These stills actually show more motion than...wait, I already used that joke earlier.\\nBRET CLARKE v. BOOKER T. to determine the #1 contender to the United States Championship - well, FINALLY, fifty minutes into the show, something I can get up for. So if Hart puts BT over here NOW, what was the point of Hart refusing to drop the title to him a few short weeks back? I guess by watching how this match goes we\\'ll REALLY have a pretty good idea of where Hart fits in with the big bookers\\' plans, won\\'t we? I think Hart said \"hi\" to his cat in here, too. \"Feeling out process\" to start. Finally they lock up, to the corner, clean break. Hart complains that T\\'s greased up. Tony refers to a clip of backstage activity! Maybe they\\'re coming around? Lockup, wristlock by T, wrenching the arm around, Hart rolls to the mat, nips up and reverses into a hammerlock of his own. T with a back elbow - Hart walks outside and works every fan in the front row. T offers to part the ropes for Hart, but nothing doing. Hart back in after referee \"Blind\" Charles Robinson backs him up. T puts some moves together and we end up with a side headlock. Hart tries to push out, off the ropes, shoulderblock, armdrag takeover and Hart AGAIN rolls to the outside. Hart\\'s MO lately has been the big stall at the start - which works but only when you get a LOT of time to develop the match. Back in, lockup, to the corner, reverse, Tony says \"Sting\" as Hart lays into T with some rights. Right to the jaw is I would say \"deliberate.\" By which I mean slow. Snapmare. In the centre of the ring, rear chinlock by Hart. Crowd is NOT chanting \"boring,\" which is a testament to Hart\\'s ability to get across a story to the fans. Have I built up Hart enough for you yet? Ha ha. Back up, Hart keeps Booker T. from getting control - to the corner, several blows, blatant choke. To the opposite corner, T FINALLY reverses and gains control. Follow lariat. Whip into opposite corner and follow lariat again. T. pulls him out, there\\'s a kick, there\\'s an axe kick, 1, 2, no. Crowd is fairly rabid. T to the armbar and calling to the crowd.\\nNow, for absolutely NO reason at all, we cut to a split screen with the satellite truck, where Disco Inferno talks to the satellite guy. The NWO is gonna pirate the satellite signal around 10:50 or 11, and the satellite guy is gonna fix it for them. Coincidentally, it\\'s time for RAW to start. THIS is gonna keep people glued to the set? I really think they\\'d have done better sticking with Booker T. and Bret Hart.\\nSpeaking of which, Hart has a near fall as I spy a \"WATCH RAW\" sign in the first row. Tony talks about the clip, then as if to say hi to me, says \"Somebody say something here - am I the only one that saw that?\" Okay, okay, you\\'ve let me know you\\'re addressing the madness. Thank you, WCW. But cut to backstage footage during the nine minute Bigelow/Hammer match instead of this one, huh? Side Russian legsweep for 2. Tony speculates that Disco had scheduled this cut \\'cause he didn\\'t want us to see Booker T. wrestle and they ALMOST win me over with that story. But I\\'m not buyin\\'. Hart takes Booker T. out to the floor and pounds away - T fires back - again - Hart has a chair and there\\'s a shot to the gut. Headbutt to the small of the back, repeat. Hart rolls him back in and fires up the crowd with a single look. He\\'s the Master! Side backbreaker. 1, 2, no. Head to the lower abs. Later tonight, Tony tries to mediate between father and son on a very special Nitro. To the corner, semi-blatant choke. Tony announces that he\\'ll have to leave the booth to get ready for that interview (thank GOD). Booker T. puts up an elbow to stop a charging Hart and both men are down. Both men up at 7 - face rake by Hart. Tony calls him \"Stevie Ray\" \\'cause he\\'s racist and they all look alike. Side suplex by Hart and Tony\\'s outta here. Legdrop by Hart. Another legdrop as Tenay actually attempts a little play-by-play, shocking the ears of the entire audience. Hart holds onto the ropes, and goes up and down with the boot. I think something was muted there. Scorpion Deathlock is applied a wee bit too close to the ropes - before it\\'s on, T pulls the hair rolls through into a small package for 2. Hart kicks a field goal with T\\'s midsection. Face rake on the rope by Hart. Kidney punch. Scoop and a slam. FIGURE FOUR! T is doing the cool writhing thing - 2 count while the shoulders are down. Crowd is BEGGING for T to get out of it. T raises the fist and the crowd goes nuts. T tries to roll - but no. Another 2 count for Hart. T tries again for a roll - and does! Hart immediately grabs the rope and the hold is broken. Both men slow to get up - Hart is up now, and T isn\\'t. Hart back to the choke for 4. Elbow to the back of the head by Hart. Whip off the rope, T ducks, flying jalapeno! Hart is up but meets a boot to the gut, then a spinning heel kick. T calls to the crowd. Sidewalk slam (called \"side slam\" by Tenay in a compromise) - breakdance by T, let\\'s raise the roof (or move along the story) - Hart pops up and gets T crotched on the top rope - Hart up - SUPERPLEX!!! Both men down and crowd is hot. Hart BARELY up at 9. Sharpshooter is applied as Hart waves \"bye-bye\" to the crowd. But they\\'re too close to the ropes and T holds on to the bottom rope. Hart won\\'t let the hold go until Robinson says 5, BARELY beating the count. Hart driving with two buttdrops onto the lower back, using the ropes for extra impact. Picking him up, Hart whips - T reverses - Sunset flip attempt by Hart is reversed as T sits back down and hooks the legs - 1, 2, 3!!!!!!!! Booker T. is the #1 Contender. (17:43) Is there ANY chance a Booker T./Scott Hall match will be this good? And where can Hart go from here? Oh, the bittersweet life of a wrestling fan...\\nOne more shot of the Flair set - Schiavone tests out his mic. I wonder if any of that furniture will get broken...\\nWCW/NWO Magazine ad\\nAnother clip of \"Konnan\\'s Brand New Music Video\" - we\\'ll watch it in it\\'s entirety later tonight. And I might say something amusing.\\nStill shots of last night\\'s big pelo contra mascara match which saw Lex Luger on the outside, yet still managing to help Hall & Nash get the best of Mysterio and Konnan and remove the mask of Rey Mysterio, Jr. so we don\\'t get bald Liz. (Yeah, who thought THAT would happen, huh?) Later tonight, another Nash/Mysterio mismatch.\\nDISCO INFER-NWO v. GLACIER HAYASHIRYU - David Penzer: \"Ladies and gentlemen, because this match involves international competition, the Disco Inferno would like you to please rise so he may sing the National Anthem!\" GOD DAMMIT, that\\'s MY gimmick! YOU tell me they aren\\'t going out of their WAY to appeal to me this week. Disco\\'s mic is unmercifully cut short. Kaz Hayashi bought Glacier\\'s outfit at a THUNDER! flea market a while back, okay. Sign in crowd: \"VACAVILLE IN THE HOUSE\" I didn\\'t even pick up on the fact that Tony was back at the commentary table but the mic check must be done. Kaz does a sweet no-hands tope over the top rope and I guess *I* should start paying attention to this match. Hayashi with a dropkick to the back of the had to a seated Disco. Rear chinlock, Inferno elbows out. Dropkick from Kaz. Off the ropes, Disco holds on and Kaz hits the mat. BIG lariat and Kaz lands RIGHT on his head. DAMN. After a strut, Disco only gets 2. Slam. Second rope forearm drop but only 2. Disco to the rear chinlock. We\\'re up, we\\'re elbowing out. Off the ropes, Hayashi with a Sunset flip for 2. Disco comes back with a vertical suplex. Off the ropes, something flubbed, Hayashi comes off the ropes with a spinning heel kick. Disco tries a powerbomb, but Hayashi counters and comes down with a Rocker dropper. Pickup - backbreaker - Hayashi to the top turnbuckle - senton with nothing but mat. Disco with the swinging neckbreaker, Chartbuster, and pin. (6:03)\\nBrian Adams tells Scott Norton that Hollywood made him the man. Scott stifles a grin to himself and goes along with it. Adams does a better job with this than Vincent did. Not that it really matters - this is like choosing which plague you\\'d like to die of.\\nHey look, it\\'s (some of) the Nitro Girls! Bobby Heenan joins the commentators at the commentary table.\\nOh, boy! Another shot of that exciting CAL Nitro Party! They\\'re doing da LIMBO! And Whisper chews Cinn-A-Burst!\\nAw we gaze \\'pon the Awesome 3, we see that Bobby Heenan is openly brandishing his \"WCW/NWO Magazine Reader\\'s Choice Award\" for Best Announcer. Then they talk some more about Ric and David because it\\'s probably the least interesting thing they could talk about.\\nThen again...SUPERSTAR SCOTT STEINER & BUFF IS THE STUFF make their way to the ring as we learn that Diamond Dallas Page has been written out of the script for a little while. Steiner brings a chick into the ring with him. Sorry, that\\'s one of his hooches. Something is muted that probably wasn\\'t what the TNT censor thought it was. Steiner AGAIN says he gets Kimberly for 30 days despite Tony saying it\\'s not true. Steiner says that Kimberly will call him \"Big Bad Booty Daddy.\" While DDP will be lying on his back, Kimberly will be lying on HER back....okay, that\\'s enough. Hmmm, after the music starts up Steiner says \"I\\'m not done yet!\" and then goes on for a bit more. He\\'s taken out his brother, he\\'s taken out Page, he mentions Sting for no good reason, and says the only man left is Goldberg. Goldberg, you\\'re next! This time \"hoo-\" gets censored for no good reason. Steiner says he\\'s challenging Goldberg - TONIGHT! Oh boy! Let\\'s lock up the television title!\\nAnother clip from that music video I\\'m NOT gonna want to see by the time they show it - most likely in the third hour\\nBruise Cruise ad. Tony drops some names for the first time - Disco Inferno, Kidman, Perry Saturn, Diamond Dallas Page, and a special autograph session with Goldberg! But whatever will Saturn WEAR?\\nStill shots from the tag team finals, where the Horsemen took the first fall, but Windham & Hennig used devious means to immediate take the second fall. Tony announces that there was a melee following that match last night, and we\\'ll learn more about it later.\\nCHRIS MONDAY JERICHO (with JPS Ralphus) v. HUGH MORRUS (with James Hart) - Ralphus finally gets a mention in the graphic - probably payment for coming to the ring in a dress. Jericho intimates that Saturn just might be....well....you know...for walking away after planting the ref in their return dress match last night instead of getting the sure pinfall to stop having to wear the dress. Morrus has a new strange haircut. Morrus all over him to start. Jericho slaps him. The chase is on. Round and round we go, back in, Jericho puts the boots to him as he comes back in, whip off the ropes is reversed, Morrus picks him up and lets him fall. Morrus with the whip, Jericho slides under, Morrus picks him up and there\\'s a half hour press slam. Commentators are remarking on Jericho\\'s losing streak (wink wink). Morrus climbs the ropes - Jericho tries to attack, but Morrus shoves him off. Top rope elbow drop misses. Jericho with a superkick and Morrus goes on the outside. Jericho with a top rope plancha to the floor! Jericho grabs a bouquet of flowers and whips Morrus with it. Jericho does his crane dance in the ring. Snap suplex by Jericho, arrogant cover only gets 2. Rear chinlock. Jericho slaps him - oh oh, made him mad. Whip off the ropes, big lariat by Morrus. \"I am going to attempt, fans, to call this match.\" Quote that man! Morrus knocks him down and does a mocking version of Jericho\\'s crane dance. Jericho dropkicks him in the knee. Snapmare. Bow\\'n\\'arrow type hold as we take a longing gaze Ralphus\\' way. Morrus turns the hold around but Jericho flips up, catching Morrus in the jaw with a kick on his way up. Neat move. Off the ropes, Morrus catches him and drops him powerbomb style. Whip into the corner - freight train splash by Morrus. Whip into the opposite corner, there\\'s another avalanche. Third time, he misses as Jericho steps aside - feet on the ropes - 1, 2, no. Whip, reversal, powerslam by Hugh Morrus. He\\'s going up - Ralphus grabs the leg! Hart takes a chair and makes a move for Ralphus - but PERRY SATURN is out and stripping the dress off Ralphus. He tosses Ralphus in the ring, so referee \"Blind\" Mickey Jay is distracted trying to get HIM out of the ring. Hart offers the chair to Saturn, but instead he KO\\'s Hart, then delivers a Spicolli Driver to Jericho. I sense the losing streak will continue. Is Saturn wearing eyeliner or what? Schiavone says he looks \"pretty.\" No Laughing Matter, 1, 2, 3. (6:58) Morrus leaves the ring and asks Saturn what\\'s up with hitting his manager. \"Hey, I did you a favour!\" \"I didn\\'t NEED an favours!\" and the next thing you know Saturn is back in the ring asking to get it on. Morrus complies. They trade blows until the cartful of refs comes out and breaks it up, to the crowd\\'s dismay. Jericho didn\\'t move this entire time.\\nFootage from last night at SuperBrawl show Hennig & Windham gloating with their belts - then Benoit & Malenko attacking for no good reason. Well, I guess they had a reason. Anyway, they choke them out with regular belts a la Windham on Malenko last night. And...umm....that\\'s it.\\nStill to come, this, that, that, and that. Oh, the third hour.\\nTV-PG-DV BIG POOCHIE (with The Narcissist, Liz & Rey\\'s mask) v. REY MYSTERIO, JR. - \"You know, Lex and I along with Liz watched the tape back from last night, and while I was taking a break on the mat, catchin\\' my breath, it appears to me that Scott Hall took a couple of shortcuts - you know the NWO has always stood for what\\'s right in this sport - for fair play - I know that Rey Mysterio went to the committee today and insisted on having a match with me, but after watching the tape back, Rey, we\\'re real sorry and, since it doesn\\'t fit me anyway, instead of fighting, come on down and I\\'ll give you back your mask (\\'cause Liz won\\'t wear it).\" Rey comes out in B&W camoflauge instead of his LWO shirt and to Konnan\\'s music instead of his own. How do you misspell \"NO?\" \"Okay, did you say what you have to say? It ain\\'t about the mask anymore, Nash. You got what you wanted, now it\\'s time to get what I want.\" \"And what would that be, Rey?\" \"It\\'s time for me to get a piece of you.\" Nash wants the test of strength but I don\\'t think Rey can reach that high. Nash\\'s high knee is almost higher than Rey\\'s head. Whip - Rey\\'s flips and flies but Nash ducks it. Rey works on the knee with kicks - spinning heel kick and Nash goes DOWN! Springboard facebuster! Nash retreats to the corner - bronco buster! Nash pushes him off - Mysterio ducks a lariat - springs up - Nash catches him and dlivers Snake Eyes. Heenan calls Nash the best big man in our sport today - WHY. Ten story beal from Nash. Jackknife coming up - of course, that doesn\\'t work on Cruiserweights - Rey punches and punches - Nash falls - Randy Anderson counts three times! Konnan\\'s music plays! (2:39) Replays show Rey hooks the wrong leg, but oh well. Let\\'s see Konnan\\'s new music video!\\nOnly the third hour is good enough for the new K-Dogg music video! I hope they paid George Clinton for that \"Atomic Dog\" sample - I mean, Time/Warner wouldn\\'t just commit outright THEFT of an artist\\'s works, would they? I wonder what Capitol thinks of this. Hey, maybe I\\'ll ask \\'em! Naah. What the hell\\'s up with the zoot suit?\\nNWO Wolfpack T-shirt ad.\\nSomeone has NOW decided that this hour will only be rated TV-PG-V so there\\'s a NEW ratings box. And here\\'s Horace telling Scott Norton that Hollywood has placed him in charge of the black & white. Why is Disco Inferno standing there? I dunno. I guess I should point out that Tony hasn\\'t remarked on any of THESE bits, but who cares anymore...not me. Well, this week. Well, unless I come up with another funny bit.\\nGENE O. works tonight! And he brings out the new tag team cham-peens, CURT HENNIG & BARRY WINDHAM. Hennig\\'s not the kinda guy to say he told you so - but - well, you know. Where\\'s Rick Rude, anyway? Does anybody have any comments about them not being in the NWO? Gene asks what about a return match, Windham says that they\\'ve got a lot of defenses scheduled and just have no room for the Horsemen. And...that\\'s all I got out of this.\\nScott Norton walks over to Hollywood Hogan and asks him what\\'s up - what, did I MISS the Stevie Ray clip? Anyway, Hollywood says no, no, YOU\\'RE the man. Take charge of the black & white. I am SO BEYOND CARING.\\nHey, look, it\\'s the Nitro Girls! And they have spotlight solo slutty stripper dances!\\nTHREE TIME WORLD KARATE CHAMPION GLACIER CAT v. ? - you see, Sonny Onoo bought Glacier\\'s music, lighting, lasers and snow machine. You really should try to watch THUNDER! every so often. \"Ladies and gentlemen, once again the Cat would like to be recognised as the greatest of all time...and the greatest looking man in sports today!\" Sonny Onoo will be on the Bruise Cruise - well, that\\'s IT, I\\'m signing up NOW. Cat goes on and on about \"James Brown music\" as if that was even close to what his music EVER sounded like. Cat demands the lights come back up, then tells the crowd they\\'re a bunch of sick lookin\\' people. Before we move along, let\\'s cut back to the black & white dressing room where Disco Inferno is monitoring the action while Norton is ALMOST ready to tell them that Hollywood has put him in charge (hmmm, there\\'s Stevie Ray after all). Sonny Onoo is less than excited about this challenge, but Cat says he\\'s doing it for him, \\'cause he \"messed up all your cousins and nephews over there in Japan.\" Here\\'s BIG SCOTT NORTON and I predict this\\'ll last about 12 seconds. Cat kicks before the bell and doesn\\'t let up. kick, kick, kick, Million Dollar Dream! Norton hiptosses him to break the Cobra Clutch. Big chop (wooooo!), again (woooo!), Cat with a kick but Norton just catches the foot, then MAULS him. Chop (woooo!) - whip into the opposite corner - Cat with a superkick, another standing side kick, a THIRD standing side kick and Norton goes down! Cat tries a splash - Norton catches him and slams him. Here comes the powerbomb. Good night everybody! (1:39)\\nTHUNDER! ad features *Bobby Blaze*!\\nHey, that WCW Monday Nitro Spring Break-Out \\'99 thing is once again brought to you by Cinn-A-Burst and 1-800-COLLECT so get used to it for the next month or six weeks okay.\\nMICHAEL BUFFER is out for the Nitro main event. Huh? Does that mean Flair and Flair will be .... aw shit.\\nSUPERSTAR SCOTT STEINER (with Buff is the Stuff) v. (bill \"192-1\") GOLDBERG in a nontitle match - Why does the champion come out first again? Steiner whomps on a plant photographer - err, I mean plot device - err, I mean... Buff runs down Buffer, then says that Goldberg isn\\'t here tonight so there won\\'t be a match. Then Steiner tries to incite a riot by inviting every random fan into the ring. Goldberg\\'s music fires up and the demeanor of the Wolfpackers changes quite a bit. Heenan gets quite surreal on us - Goldberg\\'s in your garage, he\\'s in you will - HUH? Sign in crowd \"GOLDBERG FEARS GILLBERG\" Staredown - Goldberg pushes him away. Lockup, to the corner. Steiner fails to break, throwing elbows, then knees. Whip is reversed, Goldberg put his head down though and Steiner continues the attack. Head to the buckle - Goldberg turns around and the crowd loves it. Kick to the gut, again, forearm. Steiner turns it around, whip into the opposite corner, big boot put up. Goldberg with rights. We\\'re going to take a commercial break??? God only KNOWS how they can make a match like THIS last through an ad break. Anyway, Goldberg with the military press and he drops him just before we go to break.\\nC\\'mon, Hardee\\'s? There\\'s NO Hardee\\'s for HUNDREDS of miles here. I promise.\\nWhen we come back, who knows what\\'s been happening. Steiner wants a timeout. I hope he was doing that during the break instead of now. The chase is on outside the ring after Buff grabs the leg. Looks like Goldberg must have run into a Steinerline. Whip into the barricade. Whip into the STEEL steps. Goldberg made the challenge the world heard - challenge? What challenge? To WHO? Tony says they\\'ll even throw in a taser, well, hell, they SHOULD accept it then if they\\'re gonna throw in a TASER. Steiner with a blatant low blow kick but nobody gets DQ\\'d while they wrestle Goldberg, you know. Steiner with some punches. Steiner to the whip, but for some reason Goldberg\\'s head goes through the ropes and he ends up getting clotheslined with the top rope coming back. Steiner whips him properly - lariat - elbowdrop - 2 count. Belly-to-belly suplex as Buff is working with the wire cutters on the top turnbuckle. Referee \"Blind\" Johnny Boone takes umbrage - Buff takes Boone to the turnbuckle to take him out. Buff\\'s in the ring now - Boone over the top rope. Goldberg reverses a whip and it\\'s STEINER\\'S back to the exposed STEEL. Goldberg spears Buff and the crowd is digging it. RICK STEINER is out! Double Steinerline to Buff and Steiner! Hey, the crowd was barking for Rick and not whooping it up for Goldberg! They\\'re not as stupid as I was worried they were being. Now the NWO BLACK & WHITE is out sans Norton. Vince tries to get them to rush the ring - Stevie Ray throws Vince in instead. Vince is easily dispatched with a Steinerline and a whip into a Goldberg spear from the side. The NWO walks off as Goldberg and Rick stand in the ring and the crowd is barking like nuts. Yup. (DQ, let\\'s call it .. oh .. 7:30ish)\\nThis portion of WCW Monday Nitro is brought to you by SNICKERS!\\nWrath appears on \"Mortal Kombat\" NEXT! And later, in some other federation!\\nPromotional consideration paid for by WCW Smash & Slam Wrestlers (Why would Luger\\'s action figure beat up Sting\\'s action figure?), Hi-Ener-G old wives\\' pills, Arrid XX TotalSport deodorant, Aqua Velva IceSport, and Hot Pockets!\\nHey, look, it\\'s the Nitro Girls! In SWIMSUITS! So who let all the birds into the recording studio for the background music? And why do most of these ladies seem so unattractive?\\nDisco tells the satellite guy it\\'s time to pirate the feed. The guy has a last second bout of conscience which will probably disappear right after this last ad break. What, you think they\\'d jam the feed during the COMMERCIALS? Shows what YOU know!\\nFrom the special set, Tony Schiavone stands in front of a sofa containing David Flair and Torrie Wilson - my spider sense is tingling as I hear that Ric Flair\\'s limousine has arrived at the building and the picture goes a little fuzzy...why, no, we DON\\'T see Ric Flair tonight. No, we DON\\'T get a promised event, hyped THE ENTIRE FUCKING THREE HOURS. Instead, we see a black and white NWO clip of David Flair and Torrie Wilson - Disco Inferno, doing a Gene Okerlund impersonation, tries to conduct an interview, but they are interrupted by Arn Anderson (Nash) and Mongo McMichael (Vince, in bear costume) - Arn opens a beer with his tire arn, then Torrie pushes him over. Scott Hall comes out as Roddy Piper, and here\\'s Hollywood Hogan as Ric Flair, even better than Syxx was if that\\'s possible. David spends almost this entire clip staring at Torrie\\'s breasts, good for him. I\\'ll give Hogan this, he\\'s funny unlike the rest of these guys. But I\\'m not sure that\\'s enough. Fade to white noise and a copyright notice.\\nShould I even ask why THIS week Ric Flair wasn\\'t even in the building until 10:55? No, I suppose not. Well, hell, I\\'m SURE there wasn\\'t a SINGLE person who bought tickets to go to Sacramento to see Flair anyway...\\nYou know, I just don\\'t really know what to say here. I\\'m speechless. It just...is ANYBODY totally into this? What\\'s the payoff? I mean, Monday morning I thought Mike was NUTS for even bringing up the POSSIBILITY that Hogan and Nash were trying to run WCW into the ground, EVEN with SuperBrawl IX\\'s conclusion, but THIS.....\\nHow long can they keep doing this? Is this what Flair stuck to his guns and disappeared from EVERYTHING for nearly four months to get? Is this what the fans are longing to see? How can WCW seem to turn it around, only to throw any meager gains completely in the crapper by poisoning 170 minutes with 15 minutes of....I mean, words fail me. It just does not make sense on ANY level. God, what a SHAME. All I can do is just shrug and shake my head. It\\'s a damn SHAME.\\nTune in when next week Riki Rachtman tells us how great \"Headbanger\\'s Ball\" was ten years ago.',\n",

       " {'text': 'Measles is a respiratory disease caused by a virus that grows in the cells that line the back of the throat and lungs. Symptoms last for about seven days and include a rash, high fever, cough, runny nose and red, watery eyes. Complications can include diarrhea, ear infections, pneumonia, seizures and death. According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), developing countries that are struggling with malnutrition and vitamin A deficiency, have had a growing problem with measles. In these areas it has been known to kill as many as one out of four people. It is the leading cause of blindness among African children and kills almost 1 million children in the world each year.\\nThe mumps is an acute viral illness. Symptoms include fever, headache, muscle aches, fatigue, and swelling of your salivary and parotid salivary glands. Your parotid salivary glands are located within your cheek, near your jaw line and below your ears. While complicates are rare, mumps can cause inflammation of the brain and spinal cord, spontaneous abortion and permanent deafness.\\nAlso more commonly known as “German Measles,” rubella is an acute viral disease that causes a fever and rash for two to three days. It is spread by contact with an infected person, through coughing and sneezing.\\nThe MMR combination vaccine protects children from measles, mumps, and rubella. The first dose of the vaccine is usually given to children 12 to 15 months old. The second dose follows when the child is between 4 and 6 years of age.\\nYou should be vaccinated if you have not had a blood test that shows you are immune to measles, mumps, and rubella or if you have not already had two doses of MMR or one dose of MMR plus an additional measles vaccine.\\nThis vaccine is not only for younger children but can also apply if:',\n",

And Your Email Will NEVER be Traded, Sold or Spammed!\\nOne of the major benefits of owning a water ionizer is the alkaline antioxidant water it produces. This term means a couple of things. Alkaline water is water that has been taken from 7 on the pH scale to between 7.2 and 8.5. A rating of 7 means that it is neutral. The higher rating on the scale mean that the water is now considered a base, or alkaline substance.\\nThe water being alkaline and being ingested over a period of time leads to your body having a lower level of acidosis. The rate of this is higher in our body nows because various acids are used more and more today in the processing of foods and drinks.\\nCandy, soda, flavored teas and waters and countless other products are made with various types of acids. When you combine these with the regular acids we ingest from everyday food like orange juice, tomatoes and other items, you see an overall increase in acidosis. This condition can weaken your immune system and make you more susceptible to illness.\\nThe other advantage to alkaline antioxidant water, which again is regular tap water that has been run through an ionizer, is that it is not full of the chemicals that have been deemed 'safe enough' to be in your drinking water. Typical tap water houses chlorine, trace metals and volatile organic compounds. Chlorine, when it mixes with certain organic compounds, creates carcinogenic compounds. These are otherwise known as cancer causing elements.\\nUnder the Safe Drinking Water Act, which was passed by the EPA in 1974, as long as there are trace amounts of the aforementioned substances, they are legally allowed to be present. This was done to cover for factories that have to dump byproduct chemicals from their operations.\\nThe EPA did studies and determined that these chemicals are not harmful in these trace amounts. While this may be true, there is no need for you to be ingesting these substances at all. By drinking water that has passed through a water ionizer, you can ensure that you are not getting any of these substances and that they are not sitting in trace amounts within your body.\\nBy drinking alkaline antioxidant water that is a result of the ionization process, you are ensuring that you and your family are drinking the healthiest possible water available. Don't you owe it to yourself to do what you can now to ensure the longest, healthiest and fullest life possible?\\nTo learn more about our full selection of water ionizers, enter your e-mail address on the right side of this page to get access to a 5-day e-mail course that teaches you all about alkaline water and water ionizers, including the differences between all the competing machines that we offer!\",\n",

Benjamin Peeples, Jr., and Joseph S. Mendelsohn, of Charleston and Richard L. Whitt and Jefferson D. Griffith, III, of Columbia, for Respondents.\\nPER CURIAM: The Milton P. Demetre Family Limited Partnership (Demetre) appeals two orders of the master-in-equity. Demetre argues the master erred by determining the City of Folly Beach (Folly Beach) owned East Indian Avenue. Demetre also argues the master erred by dismissing his claims for declaratory judgment, decree to quiet title, and an injunction and damages for trespass and nuisance. We affirm in part, reverse in part, and remand.\\nMost of the Island of Folly Beach, South Carolina was platted and subdivided by the Jefferson Construction Company in 1920, and recorded in the Charleston County Register of Mesne Conveyance (RMC) Office. Subsequently, in 1965 the 1920 plat was redrawn because of deterioration and in 1968 it was traced. The redraw added parcels to the 1920 plat; however, the tracing appears to be identical to the 1920 plat. All three plats share the same book and page number at the RMC Office.\\nBetween 1921 and 1925, the Folly Beach Improvement Company (FBIC) acquired the entire island of Folly Beach and mortgaged its complete interest to C & S Bank. In 1937, the FBIC sold \"all the streets, avenues, and/or lanes in and upon Folly Island\" to the Board of Township Commission of Folly Island for the use of the public. In 1942, C & S Bank foreclosed on the mortgage and the land was bought by Edward Seabrook, Sr., at a public auction. The deed conveyed the island to Seabrook \"[s]aving and excepting therefrom such lots and portions of land as have from time to time been conveyed to sundry parties by [FBIC] by deeds recorded in the RMC Office for Charleston County.\"\\nOn May 30, 2002, Demetre purchased from Seabrook, Jr., a \"portion of [East Indian Avenue] that is undeveloped and unpaved\" bordering lots 201 to 205 for $10,000 by quitclaim deed (the Road). Both the 1920 plat and the 1968 redraw show a portion of East Indian Avenue extending from lot 201 to the northwest corner of lot 205. Prior to purchasing the Road, Demetre\\'s realtor stated he had a conversation with the Folly Beach mayor and city administrator in which they told him Folly Beach did not own the Road and suggested Demetre talk to Seabrook, Jr. Subsequently, Folly Beach asserted ownership of the Road. As a result, on December 6, 2002, Demetre brought an action against Folly Beach to quiet title in Road, which borders other property Demetre owns (the Road case). Emily Brown, who was allowed to intervene in the case, owns lot 204 on East Huron Avenue and has used the Road daily to access her property since January 30, 1986.\\nOn January 23, 2004, Demetre bought two riverfront lots, 209 and 210, on East Indian Avenue from Seabrook, Jr., for $23,700 by quitclaim deed. The deed references the 1920 plat. Demetre\\'s lots are shown on the 1965 redraw, but they do not appear on the 1920 plat or the Charleston County tax map. When Demetre purchased East Indian Avenue lots 209 and 210, two existing docks from East Huron Avenue lots 209 and 210 crossed over a portion of Demetre\\'s lots to reach the water. As a result, on October 7, 2005, Demetre brought an action against Annie Crowley, Raymond Crowley, Donald Crowley, Harris Crowley, Jr., and Annie Atkinson (the Crowleys), and Harry and Patricia Beckmann (the Beckmanns) for declaratory judgment and to quiet title to lots East Indian Avenue 209 and 210, where the Crowleys\\' and Beckmanns\\' docks cross over the property (the Dock case).\\nThe Crowleys purchased lot 210, East Huron Avenue, on September 1, 1964, and the Beckmanns purchased lot 209, East Huron Avenue, on April 27, 1972. Both of their deeds referenced the 1920 plat, which shows no lots between their lots and the marsh abutting the river. The Crowleys and Beckmanns both believed they owned all the property behind their homes down to the marsh. Beckmann testified he believed everything from his property line to the Folly River was owned by the State. In 1988, both the Crowleys and the Beckmanns applied for permits from the South Carolina Coastal Council (Council) to construct docks from their lots north to the Folly River across East Indian Avenue lots 209 and 210. Both permits were granted by the Council and the docks were constructed; however, they were destroyed by Hurricane Hugo in 1989 and rebuilt in 1990.\\nOn the motion of the parties, these two cases were referred to a master-in-equity and consolidated on August 21, 2006. The cases were tried on December 12, 2006. On March 2, 2007, the master issued the Road Order, finding the Road was dedicated to the public and Folly Beach owned the Road. On March 26, 2007, the master issued the Dock Order, ruling in favor of the Crowleys and the Beckmanns on all grounds. Demetre timely filed Rule 59(e), SCRCP, motions in both cases, which were denied. Demetre then timely appealed both orders to this court and we consolidated the appeals on September 13, 2007.\\nI. The Road Case\\nA. Standard of Review\\n\"The determination of whether a roadway has been dedicated to the public is an action in equity.\" Mack v. Edens, 320 S.C. 236, 239, 464 S.E.2d 124, 126 (Ct. App. 1995). Therefore, we may find the facts in accordance with our own view of the preponderance of the evidence; however, we are not required to disregard the findings of the trial judge who saw and heard the witnesses and was in a better position to judge their credibility. Cody Discount, Inc. v. Merritt, 368 S.C. 570, 574-75, 629 S.E.2d 697, 699 (Ct. App. 2006).\\nDemetre argues the master erred by finding Folly Beach accepted the dedication by recording the deed. We disagree.\\nDedication requires two elements: (1) intent to dedicate and (2) acceptance of the dedication. Mack, 320 S.C. at 239, 464 S.E.2d at 126. The intention of an owner to dedicate his property to public use must be expressed in a positive and unmistakable manner. Horry County v. Laychur, 315 S.C. 364, 368, 434 S.E.2d 259, 261 (1993). \"It is generally held that when the owner of land has it subdivided and platted into lots and streets and sells and conveys the lots with reference to the plat, he thereby dedicates the streets to the use of such lot owners, their successors in title, and the public.\" Blue Ridge Realty Co. v. Williamson, 247 S.C. 112, 118, 145 S.E.2d 922, 924-25 (1965). \"A recorded plat may be sufficient to disclose a landowner\\'s intent to dedicate property to public use.\" Van Blarcum v. City of N. Myrtle Beach, 337 S.C. 446, 450, 523 S.E.2d 486, 488 (Ct. App. 1999). The burden of proving intent to dedicate is on the party asserting dedication. Shia v. Pendergrass, 222 S.C. 342, 349, 72 S.E.2d 699, 702 (1952); Vick v. S.C. Dep\\'t of Transp., 347 S.C. 470, 477 n.2, 556 S.E.2d 693, 697 n.2 (Ct. App. 2001).\\nEvidence of acceptance of a dedication must be by clear, convincing, and unequivocal proof. Vick, 347 S.C. at 477 n.2, 556 S.E.2d at 697 n.2. An express or implied public acceptance of the property offered for dedication must occur within a reasonable time. Helsel v. City of N. Myrtle Beach, 307 S.C. 24, 27, 413 S.E.2d 821, 823 (1992). An acceptance of an offer of dedication may be implied by the public or the public authority\\'s continuous use or maintenance of the property in some fashion. Boyd v. Hyatt, 294 S.C. 360, 365-66, 364 S.E.2d 478, 481 (Ct. App. 1988). \"Acceptance of dedication may be shown by use by a comparatively small number of persons, as in the case of a short street to the seashore.\" 23 Am. Jur. 2d Dedication § 50 (2002). \"The public use need not be constant, but merely continuous in light of the particular nature of the land.\" Id. Also, the non-assessment of taxes is a factor in the determination of dedication and acceptance. Tupper v. Dorchester County, 326 S.C. 318, 327, 487 S.E.2d 187, 192 (1997).\\nThe 1937 deed from the FBIC to the Board of Township Commission of Folly Island stated it was dedicating \"all the streets, avenues, and/or lanes in and upon Folly Island\" for the use of the public, which was properly recorded. The foreclosure deed to Seabrook stated it was conveying to him the land \"saving and excepting . . . such lots and portions of land as have from time to time been conveyed to sundry parties by Folly Beach Corporation and [FBIC] by deeds recorded in the RMC Office for Charleston County.\" Also, the 1920 plat, which was referenced in Seabrook\\'s deed, shows East Indian Avenue extending from lot 201 to the northwest corner of lot 205; and the Road is not included on the tax map. Furthermore, Seabrook\\'s quitclaim deed to Demetre references the 1920 plat.\\nAdditionally, evidence was presented at trial that the Road was paved at one time, and Folly Beach filled in pot holes on the Road, sprayed the Road for mosquitoes, and removed trees from the Road after Hurricane Hugo. Brown also testified she and her family have used the Road daily for twenty years to access her property and the public uses the Road to park cars, jog, bike, and walk dogs. Therefore, we find the master correctly held the Road was dedicated to Folly Beach by deed and plat, and Folly Beach accepted the dedication by using and maintaining the Road.\\nC. Equitable Estoppel\\nDemetre also argues the master erred by finding he did not satisfy the elements of equitable estoppel. We disagree.\\n\"Government agents, acting within the scope of their authority, can by their acts give rise to estoppel against a municipality.\" Landing Dev. Corp. v. City of Myrtle Beach, 285 S.C. 216, 221, 329 S.E.2d 423, 426 (1985). Equitable estoppel is found to exist when the following elements are present:\\n(1) [C]onduct by the party estopped which amounts to a false representation or concealment of material facts or which is calculated to convey the impression that the facts are otherwise than and inconsistent with those which the party subsequently attempts to assert; (2) the intention or at least expectation that such conduct shall be acted upon by the other party; (3) knowledge, actual or constructive, of the true facts; (4) lack of knowledge or the means of knowledge of the facts by the other party; (5) reliance upon the conduct by the other party; and (6) a detrimental change of position by the other party because of his reliance.\\nMcCrowey v. Zoning Bd. of Adjustment of City of Rock Hill, 360 S.C. 301, 305, 599 S.E.2d 617, 619 (Ct. App. 2004). The burden of proof lies with the party asserting an estoppel. Pamplico Bank & Trust Co. v. Prosser, 262 S.C. 153, 159, 203 S.E.2d 110, 112 (1974).\\nDemetre claims Folly Beach is estopped to repudiate its former interpretation of its ownership of the Road because he and his agent lacked the knowledge or means to know whether the city had formally or implicity accepted a dedication of the Road. Demetre also claims his purchase of the property is evidence of his reliance and detrimental change in position based on their statements. However, Demetre should have exercised further diligence in determining the true ownership of the parcels instead of simply relying on the alleged statements of the mayor and city administrator, especially because (1) there was initial confusion over the Road\\'s ownership, (2) Seabrook only gave Demetre a quitclaim deed, (3) the price for the property was relatively inexpensive, and (4) the Road does not appear on the tax map. Therefore, we find the master correctly determined Demetre did not satisfy the elements of equitable estoppel.\\nII. The Dock Case\\nA. Standard of Review\\n\"A suit for declaratory judgment is neither legal nor equitable, but is determined by the nature of the underlying issue.\" Felts v. Richland County, 303 S.C. 354, 356, 400 S.E.2d 781, 782 (1991). \"To make this determination we look to the main purpose of the action as determined by the complaint.\" Estate of Revis v. Revis, 326 S.C. 470, 476, 484 S.E.2d 112, 115 (Ct. App. 1997). When \"the main purpose of the complaint concerns the determination of title to real property, it is an action at law.\" Query v. Burgess, 371 S.C. 407, 410, 639 S.E.2d 455, 456 (Ct. App. 2006); see also Wigfall v. Fobbs, 295 S.C. 59, 60, 367 S.E.2d 156, 157 (1988) (\"The determination of title to real property is a legal issue.\"). In an action at law tried by the master alone, our review is limited to correcting errors of law and we will affirm the master\\'s factual findings if any evidence in the record reasonably supports the findings. Lowcountry Open Land Trust v. State, 347 S.C. 96, 101-02, 552 S.E.2d 778, 781 (Ct. App. 2001).\\nB. Ownership of the Property\\nDemetre argues the master erred by failing to make a determination that he owned all the property between the Crowleys\\' and the Beckmanns\\' lots and the mean high water mark.\\n\"Historically, the State holds presumptive title to land below the high water mark.\" McQueen v. S.C. Coastal Council, 354 S.C. 142, 149, 580 S.E.2d 116, 119 (2003); Hilton Head Plantation Prop. Owners\\' Ass\\'n, Inc. v. McDonald, 375 S.C. 220, 224, 651 S.E.2d 614, 616 (Ct. App. 2007); see also Hobonny Club, Inc. v. McEachern, 272 S.C. 392, 396, 252 S.E.2d 133, 135 (1979) (\"This Court has held that lands lying between the usual high water line and the usual low water line on tidal navigable watercourses enjoy a special or unique status, being held by the State in trust for public purposes.\"). \"One asserting title to this land must prove a specific grant from the sovereign[,] which is strictly construed against the grantee.\" Coburg Dairy, Inc. v. Lesser, 318 S.C. 510, 512, 458 S.E.2d 547, 548 (1995).\\nDemetre sought a declaration that he owns all the property between the Crowleys\\' and the Beckmanns\\' lots and the mean high water mark, and he sought to quiet any defects in his title to the land. The master did not rule on either request and only held the Crowleys and the Beckmanns believed the State owned the land when they applied for their dock permits, which does not resolve the question of actual ownership. Demetre does not dispute the presumption that the State holds in trust for public purposes the property below the mean high water mark. Therefore, because the master failed to rule on Demetre\\'s requests for a declaration of ownership and to quiet title to the portions of the lots above the high water mark, we remand this case to the master for a determination on this issue.\\nC. Other Issues\\nWe need not address Demetre\\'s remaining issues because we remand this case for a determination on whether Demetre owns the land between the Crowleys\\' and the Beckmanns\\' lots and the mean high water mark on lots 209 and 210 East Indian Avenue.\\nTherefore, we affirm the master\\'s March 2, 2007 order finding Folly Beach owns East Indian Avenue and Demetre failed to satisfy the elements of equitable estoppel. However, we reverse the master\\'s March 26, 2007 order and remand for findings in accordance with this opinion.\\nAFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, and REMANDED.\\nC.J., and SHORT and KONDUROS, JJ., concur.\\n Seabrook, Sr., and his wife, Fannie, conveyed Seabrook\\'s property to their son, Edward Seabrook, Jr., through the wills of Seabrook, Sr., who died in 1956, and Fannie, who died in 1960.\\n Also, in 2002, Demetre bought lots 206 to 208 for $45,000 from Seabrook, Jr.; lots 202 to 205 for $475,000 from another seller; and \"any and all interest in marshland or highland north of lot 201 Indian Avenue East\" for $5 from a third seller.\\n Demetre\\'s realtor, Keith McCann, sent Demetre a letter stating the Folly Beach mayor and city administrator had determined Folly Beach did not own the Road. He also stated the city officials suggested Demetre talk to Seabrook, Jr., who then offered to sell the land to Demetre. However, at trial, the depositions of the mayor and city administrator were read into the record. They both testified they did not remember telling Demetre or his realtor that Folly Beach did not own the Road.\\n Harris and Annie Crowley were the original owners of 210 East Huron Avenue; however, Harris died on April 26, 1995, leaving Annie Crowley with a life estate in the property and a fifty percent remainder interest in the property to Raymond Crowley, Donald Crowley, Harris Crowley, Jr., and Annie Atkinson. The new deed was dated August 15, 1996.\\n The Crowleys and Beckmanns were permitted to intervene in the Road case because the rear of their lots abut East Indian Avenue.\\n In fact, Demetre\\'s October 7, 2005 complaint states portions of lots 209 and 210 on East Indian Avenue are \"located within the critical area and; therefore, would require a permit for utilization from the South Carolina Department of Health and Environmental Control\\'s Office of Ocean and Coastal Management.\"',\n",

       " {'text': 'I had the pleasure of attending the Computer Assisted Legal Instruction (CALI) conference at the Marquette University Law School from June 25-27. The law school building was a sight to behold. The building is only a year old, cost over 82 million, and has as much state of the art technology as anyone could ask for. The classrooms are designed to engage students – from push to talk mics to clean sight lines to configurable spaces that are geared towards collaboration or traditional lecture, depending on the class being offered. Their “conference center” is set up to accommodate guests, let local tv stations plug into their state of the art recording studio, and give conference goers a beautiful view of downtown Milwaukee at the same time.\\nThe CALI conference was a real eye-opener on a variety of topics. Speakers presented information on topics ranging from the latest uses of iPads in the classroom to new technology options for sharing and collaborating on faculty scholarship.

In it, he writes that DOJ policy is to \"issue subpoenas for phone records of media organizations only in certain circumstances.\\n\"In this case, the Department undertook a comprehensive investigation, including, among other investigative steps, conducting over 550 interviews and reviewing tens of thousands of documents, before seeking the toll records at issue,\" Holder says.\\nOn Monday, Pruitt had blasted the Justice Department for secretly obtaining the logs for the period between April and May 2012, saying there was \"no possible justification for such an overbroad collection of telephone communications of The Associated Press and its reporters.\"\\nHolder said he understood Pruitt\\'s position \"that these subpoenas should have been more narrowly drawn ... but in fact, consistent with Department policy, the subpoenas were limited in both time and scope.\"\\nNPR\\'s David Folkenflik reports:\\n\"Deputy Attorney General James Cole authorized the subpoena of records for 20 phone lines involving a two-month period. The failure to tell the AP means the organization could not negotiate a more narrow release of records or fight it in court.\"\\nNPR\\'s Carrie Johnson says that according to Justice Department guidelines:\\n\"... the attorney general himself needs to sign off on a subpoena to a reporter. And prosecutors must demonstrate that they made every effort to get the information in other ways before even turning to the press.\\nBut those rules also say prosecutors need to notify the media organization in advance unless that would pose a substantial threat to the integrity of the investigation.\"\\nMany of the nation\\'s biggest and most influential media outlets, including NPR, joined in a letter of protest to Justice from the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press.\\nSteven Aftergood, who studies government secrecy policy at the Federation of American Scientists, told NPR\\'s All Things Considered on Tuesday that the case of the AP phone logs is \"unusual and possibly unprecedented in its broad scope and the loose definition of the investigation.\"\\nThe Justice Department was \"effectively placing entire Associated Press bureaus under surveillance,\" he says.',\n",

I know that the quickest way for a blogger to lose readers is to stop posting regularly, so I hope that there are still a few of you out there reading this. I've been really busy, mostly because of this:\\nYep, we moved! We're still in the Raleigh area, but just moved from one suburb (Cary) to another (Holly Springs). We were outgrowing our house at a rapid rate and it was time for a move.\\nAs many of you probably know, moving a family of 5 is no small feat. It's been exhausing, both physically and emotionally. I'd like to think the worst is behind us, even if we still have a LOT of unpacking and settling in to do. I haven't unpacked a single sewing or fabric box yet!\\nIn between all of the manual labor, we've also been trying to do some of this:\\n... enjoying the summer! Here's a picture of the kids at the pool this past weekend. We finally saw a drop in temperature from the high 90's (just in time for my move, of course) to a much more reasonable mid-80's, which was perfect for some summer fun.\\nAlas, probably not too much new sewing in the immediate future either. We're off to my little brother's wedding later this week -- the wedding is next Saturday in Brooklyn, NY, and I'll be serving as the best man! Time to start drafting my toast, I guess ...\\nI do have a bunch of draft posts just waiting to be written and pushed live, so I'll be trying to get those out over the next few days.

       " {'text': '“We decided to call this album Revelation because we want to make music that reveals something to people about their lives and their world,” says Jojo Garza. He’s talking about the new release by Los Lonely Boys, the close-knit Texas trio that the bassist/vocalist shares with his brothers Henry (vocals, guitar) and Ringo (drums, vocals). “As musicians and artists, we’re here to connect with people, and to share our view of things.”\\nRevelation — to be released on the band’s own LonelyTone imprint Jan. 21, 2014, in association with the respected Austin-based indie Playing in Traffic — is a landmark release for the siblings. While maintaining the infectiously melodic mix of bluesy rock ’n’ roll and rootsy brown-eyed soul that’s long endeared Los Lonely Boys to its fiercely loyal fan base, Revelation adds an expansive range of new sonic elements, e.g. the conjunto touches of “Blame It On Love,” the reggae groove of “Give A Little More,” the rustic acoustic textures of “It’s Just My Heart Talkin’ and the baroque pop elements of “There’s Always Tomorrow.”\\n“We’re always trying to broaden our horizons and advance musically, and that’s something that we were very conscious of in making this record,” Jojo states. “We’re always looking for new ways to communicate and reach people, so we experimented with a lot of different sounds and production approaches.”\\nToward that end, the brothers also collaborated with an eclectic cast of co-writers in assembling the dozen new original songs that comprise Revelation, including alt-country icon Radney Foster, in-demand pop tunesmiths Matthew Gerrard and David Quiñones, Black-Eyed Peas collaborators George Pajon Jr. and Keith Harris, and Raul Pacheco of Ozomatli.\\nRevelation also marks Los Lonely Boys’ first recording work since Henry Garza sustained serious injuries in a fall from the stage during a February 2013 performance in Los Angeles, necessitating a lengthy and ongoing recovery period.\\n“We nearly lost Henry, man, and that was a big change for us,” Jojo acknowledges. “The whole experience was a wake-up call for us. It made us rethink every aspect of our lives and our careers, and it reminded us of what’s really important to us.”\\nThe abiding sense of family unity and creative rapport that allowed the band to weather such a potentially devastating event has been built into Los Lonely Boys from the beginning. Indeed, Henry, Jojo and Ringo have been making music together for their entire lives. Their father, Ringo Garza Sr., was a member of another sibling band, the Falcones, which played throughout southern Texas in the ’70s and ’80s. When that group disbanded, Ringo Sr. went solo, and recruited his three young sons to back him. The family relocated to Nashville in the ’90s, and soon Henry, Jojo and Ringo Jr. began writing and performing their own material as a trio.\\nAfter moving back to Texas, the brothers recorded their eponymous debut album in 2003 at Willie Nelson’s Pedernales studio in Austin, with Willie himself guesting on the sessions. Although originally released on small Or Music label, Epic Records picked up Los Lonely Boys for major-label distribution in early 2004. The album quickly won the band a large national audience. Its lead single “Heaven” became a Top 20 pop hit, reached the #1 spot on Billboard’s Adult Contemporary chart, and eventually won a Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocal.\\nAfter a prominent guest appearance on the 2005 Santana album All That I Am, Los Lonely Boys solidified their success with 2006’s Sacred, which brought two more Grammy nominations, and 2008’s Forgiven, as well as the holiday-themed Christmas Spirit. Meanwhile, the band continued to build its reputation as a singularly powerful live act.\\nIn early 2009, Los Lonely Boys made their LonelyTone/Playing in Traffic debut with the all-covers EP 1969, followed by the unplugged Keep On Giving: Acoustic Live! Those releases set the stage for the band’s acclaimed 2011 album Rockpango, and for the creative leap forward that Revelation represents.\\n“We want to make music that brings people together, not music that divides people,” Jojo states. “We’re all about having a good time, but we also make an effort to write about things that really matter. A lot of people write songs about superficial things, like how you look and what kind of car you drive and how much money you have, but we’re not interested in that. We want to create music that’s about the love and the energy and the spirit that we all carry as people.”\\n“We’re very thankful that God blessed our family with a drummer, a guitar player and a bass player, and that the three of us get to make music together,” Jojo concludes. “There’s been a few bumps in the road here and there, but that happens in any family and in any band. The main thing is that we stick together, and that we’re trying to pass on that feeling of brotherhood, of familia, in the music that we make.”\\nPowered by Facebook Comments',\n",

The latter wants to meet him at the bar called “the Meeting of the Limousines” and asks him to bring the documents given to Torrence a few days ago. When he arrives there, T gives him an envelope and Janvier, his ex-colleague arrests him and takes him to Quai des Orfevres. He cannot understand what is going on until he finds out that he is accused of having blackmailed T in order to receive money from him. But a call received by the head of the police from Torrence's colleague Emile, telling that the phone received at the Agency was not made from “The Meeting of the Limousines” but from a bar across the street releases Torrence. This way he hears the whole story and has the chance to tell his side of it.\\nA few days ago T killed a man at his house in Yport because he dishonored his daughter Eveline and he threw the body from the rocks. He knew every court would let him go but wanted to spare his daughter the public scandal. However, to clean his conscience, he wrote a statement and gave it to Torrence to keep. A few days after, somebody pretending to call in Torrence's name asked for 20,000 francs to keep the secret. He gave the money but another similar phone call followed and T told the whole story to the Police.\\nNow, both the Police and Torrence with his team (Emile, Miss Berthe and Barbet) are trying to find the blackmailer. Emile thinks that he is not just a person who needs money, but also someone who wanted revenge on Torrence. The agency had put many criminals in jail and so, it had a lot of enemies. They search for recently released persons who are also highly educated because the letters written were good enough to trick T. The research leads them to Vatissard, ex employee of a lawyer. Barbet follows him but he gets stabbed in the back, without being killed. Now they have the right man and, the next day, the police manages to capture him. But there remains one mystery: how did he know about the secret conversation between Torrence and T, if any of Torrence's collaborators did not speak about it? It's Berthe who discovers it. At the floor under the Agency's siege is a beauty saloon. While renovating, the workers took out a candelabra and because of the hole in the ceiling Olga, one of the employees heard everything and told it to Vatissard, who was her lover.\\nThe review of this Book prepared by Dana Samson\",\n",

Viacom\\'s lawsuit, filed in U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, seeks $1 billion in damages.\\nCourt documents made public today by the U.S. District Court provide some fascinating insights into the behind-the-scenes machinations and allegations in the case. Google, for instance, claims that Viacom employees and its marketing partners posted \"a host of clips\" from Viacom TV shows movies to YouTube, even while complaining publicly about their appearance on the video site.\\nThe documents also reveal that Viacom attempted but failed to buy YouTube in 2006. Google successfully acquired YouTube in October 2006 for $1.65 billion.\\nViacom first proposed a \"content-partnership agreement\" with YouTube in early 2006. Negotiations continued for months, but Google bought YouTube before the partnership was complete. Viacom then switched to a \"strong-arm approach\" to gain a better deal, Google alleges.\\nIn a harshly worded statement on its website, Viacom says that the unsealed court documents \"provide the evidence and legal basis for Viacom\\'s arguments that YouTube intentionally operated as a haven for massive copyright infringement.\"\\nIt goes on to claim that \"countless\" internal YouTube communications show that YouTube planned to profit by copyright infringement: \"By [YouTube\\'s] own admission, the site contained \\'truckloads\\' of infringing content and founder Steve Chen explained that YouTube needed to \\'steal\\' videos because those videos make \\'our traffic soar.\\' \"\\nNot surprisingly, YouTube officials see things differently. In a blog post, YouTube chief counsel Zahavah Levine asserts that the safe harbors in the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) protect online services such as YouTube from copyright liability, provided the services remove unauthorized material once they\\'re notified of its existence on their site. Levine also states that content owners (e.g., Viacom) are better equipped than service providers (YouTube) to police their copyrighted content online.\\nThe likely outcome of the Google vs. Viacom fight? Years of courtroom maneuvers, millions in attorney fees, and ultimately a revenue-sharing agreement between the two sides. But the courtroom documents do provide a fascinating glimpse into the behind-the-scenes battles that rage when billions of dollars are at stake.',\n",

From what I understand, the stack is a set amount of memory given to a particular program. So when you start the program, the stack is a preset size, depending on the program, and it does not grow or shrink. The heap on the other hand is any free memory on your system. When you call the \\'new\\' operator, the program requests some amount of memory from the system\\'s free RAM. This whole concept is based on your entire system, but in the case of Java, the Virtual Machine is the system. As far as instance methods, I don\\'t know if they are copied for each object, or if there is one copy somewhere on the heap. I\\'m sure someone else knows. If I had to guess, I\\'d say it\\'s copied per instance in Java. But that\\'s purely an uneducated guess.\\nThere is more detail about how the memory is allocated in the JVM in this page from the Jakarta BCEL project. Much more detail, which requires very careful reading! If I remember correctly, it tells us there is one copy of each method for each class. Also there is one copy of each static variable for each class, which can be shared between all the instances. The whole lot all together is called a \"class object.\"\\nThere are as many instances in the \"heap\" as you can create and fit in. Each instance on the heap has details of its fields, but does not contain its methods. Rather, it has a reference back to its own class object, where the methods are. Whenever you call a method on an object, the details are passed back to the class object, along with a reference to the instance on the heap.\\nThey explain it a lot better in BCEL!\\nJoined: Oct 13, 2005\\nI think I have given the impression that static variables are in the same part of memory as methods.

       " {'text': 'Chile’s efforts to diversify its energy matrix recieved a huge boost last month, as renewable energy company Enel Green Power (EGP) won a public tender to develop a giant wind farm in the Antofagasta region.\\nEGP has been granted the exclusive right to build and operate a wind project, named Sierra Gorda Este, of up to 130 MW. The company already has 182 MW of installed energy capacity in Chile, split evenly across wind and hydropower operations.\\nWind power has grown rapidly in Chile over the last decade. In 2002, the country was generating just 1 MW of energy from the renewable energy source. Rapid development in the sector saw an increase to 20 MW in 2007, and further growth has seen the country’s wind energy generation rocket to today’s figure of 190 MW.\\n“We are extremely pleased about such an accomplishment, as Chile represents for us a very important market with a solid group footprint and excellent growth opportunities,” Francesco Starace, CEO of EGP, said in a statement. “The successful participation in this tender is a major step forward in the implementation of our strategy for Latin America. With this project, we have covered close to 90 percent of our planned wind development in the country during the 2013-2017 period.”\\nDue to a strong economy and growth in the mining sector, analysts believe that Chile will need to add 8,000 MW to today’s energy matrix of 17,000 MW by 2020. Recognizing Chile’s massive potential in renewable energy resources, the government has made steps to diversify the energy matrix that is currently reliant on dam generated power.\\nChile’s theoretical capacity for wind generated power has been placed at 40,000 MW. If current plans for wind farm development receive environmental clearance, and projects gain financial backing, Chile could potentially be generating 2,000 MW of energy from wind power in the next decade.\\nIn addition to its great potential for wind power, Chile has a higher capacity for tide power and solar energy than any country on earth.',\n",

The main feature is the stabilization of currencies all over the world for the benefit of international trade.\\nHow is this done? Through a world bank and a monetary fund. The bank will have a capital of $9,100,000,000, to which every nation contributes in proportion to its wealth. Our share is $3,175,000,000. Voting power and control correspond to contributions. The bank will approve and guarantee loans for reconstruction and development of countries ruined by the war.\\n* * *\\nSome foolish people will ask: Why do we have to concern ourselves with the development and reconstruction of the ruined countries? The answer is simple. We are the greatest producing country in the world. We need markets not only at home, but abroad, and we cannot have them unless people can start up their industries and national economy again and buy from us. If Europe or Asia falls apart because of starvation or lack of work for their people, chaos will result and World War III will be in the making. In that event, we know that we will have to be a part of it.\\nWhy do we need a monetary fund? This fund is an international stabilization pool of $8,800,000,000, to which we contribute $2,750,000,000. Members may borrow from it, to the extent of 25 percent of their own contributions in any one year, in order to stabilize their currency.\\nWe need to stabilize currencies throughout the world because in the past there has been much speculative trading in currencies. Economic warfare results, and in time this brings us to shooting warfare. The simple way to look at it is this: If you want to sell goods in Holland, and their currency is depressed between the day that they agree to buy and the day they actually pay for what they buy, they are unable to buy because it costs them too much. The outcome is either that we lose our markets, or we are paid the amount we bargained for in money that does not have the value we expected it to have—which is a loss to us as individual merchants or traders. Consequently, we need both the bank and the fund for our own security, as well as for that of the rest of the world.\\n* * *\\nYou can write your Senators and Representatives and tell them how you feel about this. Whether you are a farmer or a merchant, whether your business is big or little, you are personally affected by it. Even if you don't sell directly to a foreign country, you are indirectly affected—for the prosperity of the country means your prosperity, and we cannot prosper without trade with our neighbors in the world of tomorrow.\",\n",

He really is amazing.\"\\nBraly designed Rifle and Project X shafts before creating the KBS brand. Considering there was no such thing as a KBS shaft before 2008, Braly\\'s achievements with his most recent shafts are staggering.\\nLooking at the official survey results from the major professional tours for the last six years, it\\'s a matter of record: more than 100 victories for KBS, including the Open Championship in 2012 (Ernie Els) and 2013 (Phil Mickelson), the Masters in 2013 (Adam Scott), the U.S. Open in 2013 (Justin Rose), plus the Senior PGA Championship and U.S. Senior Open (both in 2013 by Kenny Perry).\\n\"It has been unbelievable,\" Braly said. \"This thing has come on much, much, muck quicker than I anticipated. I knew we\\'d be successful, but I didn\\'t know it would happen this fast.\"\\nAll this from a guy without a college degree who has been consumed for decades by the search for the perfect golf shaft.\\n\"I attended plenty of (college) classes,\" said the 58-year-old Braly of his stint at Wake Forest, \"but I wanted the knowledge, not the degree.\\n\"I learned about the stiffness of tubular products by studying flag poles, ship masts, fishing poles, things like that. There was literally nothing on golf clubs. It wasn\\'t a science at all.\"\\nThere can be no discussion of Braly without mentioning his father, Dr. Joe Braly. The father-son duo helped turn the study of golf shafts into a science.\\nIn his lifetime, Joe Braly has been an engineer, aviator and veterinarian. He remains a golf nut and avid supporter of his son\\'s lifelong golf endeavors. The elder Braly invented the Console wedge, with an aerodynamic sole that acted much like a wing. The younger Braly was in grade school at the time.\\nA few years later they were testing clubs and shafts on a robot owned by Wilson Golf when the precocious son proclaimed, \"Hey, Dad, there\\'s something wrong with these shafts.\"\\nThe shafts didn\\'t match. This led to the invention of frequency matching shafts.\\n\"My dad invented frequency matching,\" Kim acknowledged. \"I was the guy who did the shaft design. He left that to me.\"\\nDesigning golf shafts may seem like a weighty project for someone in his early 20s, but it seemed like the natural thing to do for a young man consumed with the game.\\n\"I thought I was the world\\'s best golfer,\" Kim said, \"but it didn\\'t quite work out that way.\"\\nWhat did work out was the strategy employed by the Bralys:\\n\"We did our research on Tour,\" Kim said. \"We followed the Tour around. We would have the best players in the world hit these various shafts.\"\\nIn 1977 they formed a company, Precision Shafts, and patented a frequency analyzer. Soon their FM (Frequency Matched) Precision rose in popularity on the PGA Tour. Precision was sold to Brunswick Corp. in 1986, the primary supplier of their FM shafts. The Bralys went to work for Brunswick, and soon thereafter Kim invented the Rifle shaft.\\nIn 1996, Brunswick sold Precision to a group of private investors. The Bralys stayed with the company, and Kim created Project X.\\nIn 2006 shaft giant True Temper purchased the company, and Kim was on his own. In partnership with a shaft manufacturer called FST Shafts, he formed KBS in 2007.\\nHere is a rundown of eight KBS steel iron shafts. Weights are listed for taper-tip shafts. Better players often prefer taper-tip, although many KBS shafts are available in parallel tip as well.\\n- C-Taper: Low spin, low launch for advanced players. Taper tip, 110-130 grams.\\n- C-Taper Lite: Mid-high launch, firm tip, soft butt section. Features a constant taper design. Taper tip, 105-115 grams.\\n- Tour: The original KBS shaft with a mid trajectory. Taper tip, 110-130 grams.\\n- Tour-V: For players who prefer a lighter weight with less ball spin. Features tight shot dispersion. Taper tip, 100-120 grams.\\n- Tour-V Wedge: Piercing ball flight with a lower-mid trajectory. Taper tip, 125 grams.\\n- Tour 90: The lightest KBS shaft. High trajectory, additional spin. Taper tip, 95-102 grams.\\n- Wedge: Similar feel to KBS Tour. Firm tip, 110-130 grams.\\n- Hi-Rev: Mid trajectory with increased spin rate on short-range shots. Features an active tip section to provide maximum ball spin. Taper tip, 115-135 grams.',\n",

       " {'text': 'Ecological Genetics of White Campion (Silene latifolia ) Seed Banks: A Comparison of Light and Dark Germination Among Maternal Families\\nKelly N. Kiefer, Katherine R. Okey, and Patricia A. Peroni\\nDepartment of Biology, Davidson College\\nMany plant species maintain a seed bank. These\\nseed banks may function as reservoirs of genetic variation. Such genetic\\nbanks could influence responses to novel selective pressures and ameliorate\\nthe effects of inbreeding when population size becomes small. However, inadequate\\nknowledge exists for most species on whether or not differential survival\\nof genotypes in the seed bank actually occurs. Although a seed bank can\\nserve as the genetic \"memories\" of populations, these \"memories\"\\nmay be selective.\\nWhite campion, a dioecious perennial herb, has served as the subject of a metapopulation investigation in SW VA for the past decade. Seed dispersal is extremely limited which means that the seed banks could stabilize the dynamics of population fragments by providing means of reestablishing a population and/or by minimizing the effects of inbreeding in a small population. Peroni and Armstrong (in prep) and Peroni, Boozer, Whitehead, Marshall, Kiefer, and Okey (in prep) documented the existence of white campion seed banks, but have little information on the ecological genetics of these pools.\\nWe chose to manipulate one environmental factor experienced by buried seeds (darkness), and used maternal families of seeds to address the following questions.\\n1. Do maternal families vary in ability to germinate in the dark?\\n2. How does the relative performance of the maternal families in the dark compare with the performance in the light?\\nA significant interaction effect (family*treatment) was found for the Whittaker population. Viability differed significantly between the populations, but not among families within the populations. No correlation between mass and percent germination within the populations was found.\\nSeeds were collected from 2 populations of Silene latifolia in Eggleston, VA, during summer of 1996.\\n5 families were selected from each population (10 families total).\\nFifty seeds per family were assigned to light treatment and 50 seeds were assigned to dark treatment.\\nEach seed was placed in a cell well plate containing sand and dH20.\\nCell well plates were placed in a light (14 hr light/ 10 hr dark) or dark incubator (22oC).\\nAt day 11, germination for each seed was tallied.\\nUngerminated seeds from light treatment were tested for viability.\\nExperiment was repeated switching incubators.\\nMaternal families of white campion display differing abilities to germinate in the dark.\\nRelative performance in the light cannot always predict a family\\'s relative performance in the dark.\\nThe differences in germination observed among maternal families could reflect heritable differences and/or maternal environment effects. However, since we found no correlation between mean family seed mass and percent germination in either treatment, we suspect that the differences among families are genetic in nature.\\nThe white campion seed bank may contain only a selective subset of the genetic variation found in a given seed crop.\\nIDEAS FOR FUTURE INVESTIGATION\\nConduct controlled crosses in the greenhouse to control for variable maternal environment effects, and repeat the investigation.\\nCompare seed survival of maternal families or different controlled crosses during burial in the field.\\nDetermine if inbred and outcrossed seeds vary in their ability to survive burial (investigation underway).\\nMuch gratitude to Katherine Okey and Wyatt Rivens for invaluable help and to Dr. Patricia Peroni for her expert advice throughout this project.\\n© Copyright 2000 Department of Biology, Davidson\\nCollege, Davidson, NC 28036\\nSend comments, questions, and suggestions to: firstname.lastname@example.org',\n",

At first blush, the connection between us here in the Pine Tree State and an entire nation half a world away might seem tenuous. However, when you look at things through the prism of demographics, Japan has some sobering and important lessons for Maine and the Midcoast region specifically.\\nFirst, a brief history lesson. Many of you may recall that during the 1980s much punditry was expended on the idea that Japan was going to both overhaul the USA as the world’s wealthiest economy and buy up much of corporate and cultural America in the bargain. Indeed, the Japanese economic miracle in the years following World War II through the early nineties was incredibly impressive and by the eighties did indeed appear to outstrip an America that seemed to be in decline. But then through the nineties the Japanese economy faltered and stagnated while the US economy revived and surged forward (albeit on some shaky foundations: more on that in later columns).\\nWhat explains Japan’s reversal of fortune? As just about everybody knows, the basic ingredients for economic growth are supply and demand. Demand suffers (as we are experiencing globally right now) when over-inflation of value in one or two areas of the economy (real estate, for example) implodes, leaving behind debt and default to consume income, depriving goods and services of their markets. But what about supply?\\nDecline in demand is pretty obvious: less stuff is sold, less money is made. Decline in supply capacity is a little more intangible but equally as concerning, and I would posit that it has been the fundamental issue with the Japanese economy (and where the parallels with Maine are most apparent and concerning).\\nSupply forms an economy’s productive potential, which is comprised of three things:\\nCapital- access to money to invest- is a no brainer (and one that is being depressed by the current ructions in the economy). Without ideas (new products, new processes, or new pricing) there is nothing to invest in. Population (or more crucially, population growth) provides the productivity that turns the combination of capital and ideas into profit and thus economic growth. And without population, the first two elements- capital and ideas- are also exponentially more difficult to generate.\\nIn the early nineties Japan lost access to capital through market collapse, to ideas through protectionist impulses designed to preserve existing industries rather than explore new ideas and to population growth through restrictive immigration policies, low birth rate, and a declining available workforce due to a rapidly aging population. Does any of this sound uncomfortably familiar?\\nMany of us working in economic and community development have known for a long time what recent census data reported here on Village Soup tells us: Maine is getting older and at a faster rate than the rest of the United States while our population growth- especially in the traditional working age demographics- is an anemic shadow of what it needs to be to support services for the 90% increase in people aged 75 and over in Maine projected for the next 20 years. There’s nothing wrong with a large number of older citizens as the knowledge base and other gifts they bring are invaluable, but a broad age pyramid is a basic fact of societal sustainability and something we need to find how to address quickly.\\nWithout age (and I would argue, ethnic) diversity of sufficient magnitude we risk narrowing the capacity of our workforce, and with that we also begin to lose access to a sufficient number of ideas and input of capital to maintain the economic component of our fabled quality of life. That’s Maine’s Japanese conundrum, and we must focus on solving it- all of us, both young and old!\",\n",

       " {'text': 'University appoints economic-development officerBy Catherine Doss\\nSpectrum Volume 19 Issue 22 - February 28, 1997\\nVirginia Tech has named John S. Phillips, a former New River Valley banking official, to coordinate its economic-development efforts. Phillips comes to the university from First National Bank in Christiansburg where he served as vice president for commercial banking.\\n\"We are pleased to have someone of John\\'s caliber with us as we move ahead with our commitment to bolster the university\\'s economic-development initiatives,\" said Tech President Paul Torgersen.\\nAs economic-development officer, Phillips will coordinate university programs designed to enhance economic development across the state. He will establish a visible point of access for external corporations and organizations to provide information and follow-up on requests for assistance and will work to form beneficial alliances between Virginia Tech faculty members, students, and programs and businesses, governments, and industry. Phillips will report to the university\\'s vice provost for outreach.\\nThe newly created position was announced last October in a statement by Torgersen that addressed the university\\'s plans for bolstering economic development. At that time, Torgersen also announced the formation of an external Economic Development Advisory Committee and an internal Economic Development Council, both designed to raise the awareness of the importance of assisting businesses, industries, and communities across the state. These two groups will review current initiatives supporting economic development and recommend programs that enhance public and private-sector economic development.\\n\"The significant number of economic-development activities within the university, along with the expectations of our external constituencies, demands a more coordinated approach to economic development at the university level, \"Torgersen said. \"Our goal is to share more effectively the fruits of our research and education to enable the commonwealth and its citizens to succeed and prosper in the face of a rapidly changing world.\"\\nPhillips brings to Virginia Tech nine years of experience in banking, serving the financial needs of businesses ranging from start-ups to large corporations. He successfully established a new line of business for First National Bank, anew private and commercial banking center at the Virginia Tech Corporate Research Center, and obtained and brokered Small Business Administration and other guaranteed and direct loans.\\nPhillips is a graduate of the Virginia Military Institute and received a masters degree in business administration from Virginia Tech\\'s R.B. Pamplin College of Business.\\n\"I\\'m excited about the number and range of opportunities for Tech to assist in economic development across Virginia,\" Phillips said. \"This is an important mission of the university, and I look forward to building mutually beneficial partnerships.\"\\nFor more information about economic development initiatives at Virginia Tech, call Phillips at 1-2335.',\n",

       " {'text': \"How do you screen a tenant with no credit history? Learn how to proceed with this tutorial on tenant credit history.\\nWhen we say someone lacks a credit history, it either means he has no Fico Score or no record was found.\\nWhat No Fico Score Means: The tenant had no credit activity reported to the credit bureaus (Equifax, Experian, TransUnion) in the past 6 months. In other words, the tenant didn't touch any credit cards, loans or mortgages in the last 6 months (or at least one that reports to credit bureaus).\\nSo a tenant with no Fico score isn't necessarily a bad thing - It just indicates that he wasn't involved in (reported) credit or debts recently.\\nWhat No Record Found Means: Incorrect tenant information was submitted OR The tenant hasn't established a credit record yet.\\nIncorrect tenant information submitted: Were there any typos or missing information when you were applying for your tenant credit reports? It's also possible that your tenant provided you with incorrect personal particulars (by accident or on purpose).\\nTenant hasn't established a credit record: Young renters and new immigrants often fall into this category. Most of the time it's because they don't have any personal income yet (e.g. students) or they haven't incurred any debts yet.\\nLet's get something out of the way first: Zero credit history is better than bad credit history. Even if someone has no tenant credit history, there are still other effective ways to screen him or her.\\nAsk your tenant applicants for their previous rental records: three previous addresses, the rental dates and contact details of former landlords.\\nAs a rule of thumb, you would want someone who has stayed at least for a year at each of the previous addresses (longer is better). You should also call or email at least 2 former landlords to ask for their references.\\nRequest for their employment records as well. Useful information includes: current salary, (previous + current) work addresses and (previous + current) duration of employment. What you hope to see is someone who has worked at least 6 months at his or her current job and draws a salary that is at least 3 times higher than your asking rent.\\nIf your prospective tenants are willing, you can also ask them for your bank account statements. He should have at least enough money in the bank for at least 2 months of rent (6 months would be ideal).\\nMy Tip for Tenant Credit Checks Not rated yet\\nSome potential renters are highly concerned with any negative and false information that may show up when you run a landlord tenant credit check on them. …\",\n",

But somehow, the Nationals now must replace their leadoff man and center fielder.\\nMorgan will miss the rest of the season after breaking his left hand in Thursday afternoon\\'s 5-4 win against the Chicago Cubs at Wrigley Field. Back in the lineup after missing two games with the flu, Morgan -- before the injury -- provided a quick glimpse of his value. He walked to start the first inning, then stole two bases and scored.\\nThe injury, though, occurred when Morgan jammed his left hand during a head-first slide into third base. When the inning ended, Willie Harris replaced Morgan in center.\\nBy the time the game ended, Washington already knew the bleak prognosis. Morgan\\'s injury -- technically a fracture of the second metacarpal -- will keep him out for six weeks. As the Nationals resume their road trip in St. Louis, Morgan will fly back to Washington, D.C., and visit with hand specialist Tim Graham. Morgan, hours after the injury, already had his left hand heavily bandaged. He used his teeth to yank the sleeves of his hooded sweatshirt.\\n\"It\\'s broke, guys,\" Morgan said to the media, \"and I\\'m done for the year.\"\\n\"It hurts,\" General Manager Mike Rizzo said. \"It\\'s a stumble for us. But Willie has been out there before Nyjer got here. Willie is gonna be out there again; we\\'ll give him a chance to step up.\"\\nAfter being acquired on June 30 in a four-player trade with Pittsburgh, Morgan quickly became one of Washington\\'s most indispensable players. His outfield range benefited those in left and right, and won the appreciation of the pitching staff. With the Nationals, Morgan compiled a .351 average (67 for 191) and stole 24 bases.\\nThe Nationals are not yet sure of a corresponding roster move. They could consider Class AAA outfielder Justin Maxwell, a smooth fielder who has had two earlier stints with Washington this season.',\n",

In dating the recovered artifacts, human fossils and other historical objects, archaeologists uses two types of dating techniques: absolute and relative dating. Absolute dating relies on the physical properties of the sample in order to calculate the age of it. These include the very famous Radiocarbon dating, dendrochronology, potassium-argon dating, Thermoluminescence dating, Numismatics and optical dating. Relative dating on the other hand is a method of determining not exactly the age of the artefact rather the order in which certain events occurred. Examples of relative dating are the fluorine dating and Seriation.\\nAnthropology is also called the science of humanity. It also studies the past civilizations but more concentrated on the present or modern societies. The goal of anthropology is more focused on understanding the connections of the artifacts or remains with the behaviors of the civilization. These behaviors include leadership and government formation, society development and adaptation development. Anthropologists also date their remains using the absolute and relative dating.\\nJoin to answer this question\\nJoin a community of thousands of dedicated teachers and students.Join eNotes',\n",

The purpose of this study was to determine whether dense cranial electroacupuncture stimulation (DCEAS) could enhance the antidepressant efficacy in the early phase of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD).\\nIn this single-blind, randomized, controlled study, patients with MDD were randomly assigned to 9-session DCEAS or noninvasive electroacupuncture (n-EA) control procedure in combination with fluoxetine (FLX) for 3 weeks. Clinical outcomes were measured using the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17), Clinical Global Impression-severity (CGI-S), and Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS) as well as the response and remission rates.\\nSeventy-three patients were randomly assigned to n-EA (n = 35) and DCEAS (n = 38), of whom 34 in n-EA and 36 in DCEAS group were analyzed. DCEAS-treated patients displayed a significantly greater reduction from baseline in HAMD-17 scores at Day 3 through Day 21 and in SDS scores at Day 3 and Day 21 compared to patients receiving n-EA. DCEAS intervention also produced a higher rate of clinically significant response compared to n-EA procedure (19.4% (7/36) vs. 8.8% (3/34)). The incidence of adverse events was similar in the two groups.\\nDCEAS is a safe and effective intervention that augments the antidepressant efficacy. It can be considered as an additional therapy in the early phase of SSRI treatment of depressed patients.',\n",

It is the story of a boy who saves his sister by allowing the Devil to become his shadow. Now you're his slave and get to help him take over the world.\\nIf you think this sets up a very humorous situation between your character and the Devil (Stan), you'd be right. OKAGE uses a lot of humor to keep the game fresh. Stan is hilarious, but the biggest problem is that some of the other characters are very flat. It's like a great job was done translating (from the original Japanese) for Stan but it seems that they slacked off on the rest of the characters. Still, the Japanese humor is quite good and keeps the game very entertaining.\\nThe comedy of the game continues as you interact with other characters. Nobody realizes who Stan is and they just think it's a cool trick that your character does with his shadow. This in turn annoys Stan to no end. You also have plenty of witty one-liners you can use on people. In one situation, I was about to leave for the circus and I asked my character's father to explain something technical to me. After I couldn't butt in, the game fast-forwarded two hours and the circus was long over.\\nNow, once you get into the traditional elements of the RPG such as battle, the comedy continues. While the zany names get old, as well as the dialogue, the game is pretty funny overall.\\nAs far as the gameplay itself, there is a really repetitive battle system. I got very annoyed at the fights after a while. To make it worse, as you get deeper into the game, fights begin to take the place of the comedy. Instead of moving towards the game's strong point, we begin to move towards the weak area.\\nThe graphics are a tad bit outdated. They're pretty bland and somewhat repetitive. There are also some camera issues that really should have been resolved. The soundtrack is great, but again somewhat repetitive.\\nOKAGE can appeal to anyone. But the gameplay isn't there to back it up. If you have a weekend, pick it up at Blockbuster and play it for a while.

Simply, I am having the time of my life. I arrived in Stuttgart with no ticket for the Aussie Croatia game, but after a morning of searching around scalpers. I had a ticket. 300 euro, but boy is it the best 300 I have ever spent, I went with 2 other girls Lena and Kate. It was absoloutly amazing. I have never been so high and so low in the space of 90 minutes. I have some of the best photos ever...and I totally lost my voice. The chanting started around one with thousands of Aussies having chanting contest with the Croatians. It was incredibly..the great thing was that Aussie Aussie Aussie was almost never used. We were coming up with heaps of great Chants. It was incredible..I am going to be saying that word a lot. It was and vibrant atmosphere at the stadium, the Aussies were going off\\n(A few days later) What a massive few days, I am having the time of my life at the moment. Germany is the biggest party town in the world.\\nThis morning we went on the Amazing race for World Cup Tickets around Stuttgart. I met up with a mate, Michael Bolton, and another guy. Who believe it or not turned out to be Mark Daniels (A Mate, who I went to school and Uni with) older brother Tim, bloody small world. There was intense pressure around the place, Aussies were everywhere on Internet terminals and around town on mobile phones. The announcement meant was going to be made at 9 and it was going to be a First Come First Served basis. With only 1500 tickets and about 60000 Australians in Germany it was going to be tough. By the way, I was meant to fly to Barcelona today, not chance. Missed my flight.\\nWe were at the train station with heaps of Aussies, we decided sitting in a net cafe was a bad idea as everybody was doing it\\nDejected at first, we all lined up hope that we were under the 1500. At first it didn't look hopeful...but after waiting for about 2 hours I was given a wrist band, which guaranteed me a ticket..Relief at last..I HAVE A TICKET..time for K-Town!!!\\nI left there with the guy I had bought the tickets with and we headed down to the beer garden for a celebration! I had one beer, and felt really sick..the adrenaline had vanished and the hangover from the previous nights drinking kicked in..I had a massive night with Phil, Dex and Matty (who is in my soccer team) and a bunch of other Aussie guys and girls. Massive I did about 5 and a half litres, the boys did 6 and a half as they started before me...Now that was catch up to me..So.. Michael walk 20 metres to a bit of grass and passed out for about 3 hour...It was an intense day!\",\n",

       " {'text': 'Last week in Atlanta was a desperate scene as a crowd of 30,000 people gathered for the chance to receive a public housing assistance application. The throng spent hours enduring sweltering temperatures even though the city’s available public aid falls far short of the exceeding need. The situation is representative of the overall dire economic struggle faced by the city’s sizeable low-income population.\\nAround the same time the event made national headlines, The Salvation Army of Atlanta posted a video of a homeless mother who has found shelter and resources through their center. The assistance will keep her family off the streets and empower her to more quickly get back on her feet. The mother’s account shines as a positive contrast to the pessimistic news stories, showing hope available through The Salvation Army for those who have fallen into economic crisis.\\nThe city’s need, though, has resulted in a significant increase in demand for services from The Salvation Army Atlanta and has put a strain on their operational resources. Staff has logged countless hours of overtime. They are fielding some 40,000 calls each day from metro Atlanta residents seeking relief and their phone systems are overwhelmed.\\nSo that The Salvation Army does not have to turn away one person in need, they have launched a “Call to Action” campaign to raise $300,000 in additional funds by September 30, 2010 to help meet the needs of hurting callers.\\nSupporters can donate by:\\n– Clicking Here for a Secure Online Donation\\n– Phone at 1-800-SAL-ARMY\\nc/o Call To Action\\nThe Salvation Army\\nP.O. Box 49247\\nAtlanta, GA 30359\\nFor more information on how you can help, visit The Salvation Army Atlanta’s website at www.salvationarmyatlanta.org or follow them on Facebook, Twitter, and their blog.\\nThank you for your help and consideration!\\nThe headlines under the newspaper’s business section seem to leave us lacking in optimism as of late.\\nParticipation in the nation’s food stamp program hit a record high of 40.8 million in May, continuing a pattern of record highs for 18 straight months.\\nU.S. unemployment for July remained unchanged at 9.5%.\\nWith the job market still struggling, the U.S. Congress passed another unemployment benefits extension for Americans without work who are trying to support themselves and their families.\\nIncreased need has resulted in unprecedented demand for social services at many non-profits and charities, including The Salvation Army.\\nBill and Melinda Gates, top, and Warren Buffett, bottom, have encouraged billionaires to donate half or more of their fortunes to charity through an initiative called ‘The Giving Pledge.’\\nAs mentioned in our National 2010 Annual Report, some local Salvation Army units have reported a demand for services more than 400% above normal. In Hickory, North Carolina, we’ve served 75,000 more people than this time last year. And one of our food pantries in Pen Argyl, Pennsylvania serves up to 50 families per week, up from last year’s 15 families per week.\\nThe good news is it seems that with increased need there’s also been a heightened call in general for philanthropic generosity.\\nRecently Bill and Melinda Gates and Warren Buffett announced an initiative called ‘The Giving Pledge,’ an effort to encourage American billionaires to give half of their wealth to charities or non-profits during their lifetime or after their death. It’s an interesting idea that they hope will “draw more people into philanthropy” and “continue for generations” to come. A list of pledge signers, including George Lucas, Ted Turner and T. Boone Pickens, is available at http://givingpledge.org.\\nWhat do you think of this idea? What causes would you like to see supported by these pledge signers?\\nIt would be wonderful if this initiative did result in more resources reaching those most in need, but thankfully you don’t have to be a billionaire to make a difference.\\nIn fact, I would argue that Salvation Army supporters are some of the most generous people out there. This year The Salvation Army’s Christmas Red Kettle donations soared to a record $139 million. That’s $9 million more than our 2008 record, another year in which the economy and logic suggested that donations would be down. And no, these donations did not come from billionaires. Most of it came in pennies, nickels, dimes, and quarters from regular people with big hearts.\\nThough many Salvation Army offices were not (and are not) exempt from the strain of limited resources amidst escalating demand, The Salvation Army was able to provide help to nearly 30 million Americans last year thanks to our benevolent donors.\\nSo while headlines may tempt us to feel dispirited, thankfully, as our supporters show us, there’s more to the story.\\nThe Salvation Army has released its 2010 online annual report, available at http://www.salvationarmyannualreport.com/.\\nThe theme of this year’s report is “Shine” – The Salvation Army strives to be a shining light of hope in communities nationwide. As we continue to navigate through difficult economic times, we’re encouraged by the stories we hear each day from across the country. Some of these stories are shared in this report — from an after school program in St. Paul, MN; to a GED course in Tucson, AZ; a family shelter in Akron, OH and a Boys & Girls Club in Tulsa, OK.\\nThe people you see in these videos, from teenagers to an 80+ year-old woman, are telling their real, personal accounts of how The Salvation Army has helped them turn their lives around. Their stories are truly inspiring and stand as a reminder of why we do what we do every single day.\\nAs one of the oldest and largest social service charities in the United States, The Salvation Army provided help to nearly 30 million Americans last year alone. During our previous fiscal year, The Salvation Army:\\n* Served 64 million meals to people in need\\n* Helped nearly 1 million Americans following disasters\\n* Sent 180,000 unprivileged kids to summer camp\\n* Counseled 370,000 individuals with drug and alcohol rehabilitation\\nThank you for your support that has helped make our service possible. Learn more through our annual report about The Salvation Army’s diverse programs and services utilized by those in need last year.\\nAnd please help us spread the word – Tweet, Facebook and email the report to friends, family, neighbors – anyone who might want to learn that The Salvation Army is about a lot more than thrift stores and kettles! Check us out and find more information on:\\n* Facebook (www.facebook.com/SalvationArmyUSA)\\n* Twitter (www.twitter.com/salvationarmyus)\\n* National Website (www.salvationarmyusa.org)\\nThanks again for your continued support of The Salvation Army!\\nMore than 12,000 students in need across the country did their school supplies shopping today as a part of Target and The Salvation Army’s Back-to-School Spree!\\nEach participating child, selected by The Salvation Army, was awarded an $80 Target GiftCard to purchase much-needed back-to-school supplies, and they were paired with a volunteer chaperone to help them pick out their new items. Target has awarded all 40 of The Salvation Army divisions nationwide a total of $960,000 worth of Target GiftCards, an incredible donation that without which this event would not be possible.\\nWe here at The Salvation Army National Headquarters had the great pleasure of attending the Back-to-School Spree that took place at the Target in Falls Church, VA this morning. It was a GREAT time![gallery link=\"file\" order=\"DESC\"]\\nFor more pictures from today’s Back-to-School Spree, visit The Salvation Army’s National Flickr page HERE.\\nThe aisles of fresh notebooks, colorful markers, and shiny backpacks generated pure excitement in the faces of the kids as they perused the shelves with their Salvation Army volunteer chaperones. 30 local area children ranging from grade levels K-12 participated at this location. For many of them it was the first time they’ve ever bought brand new school supplies, but this year they’ll be able to start the upcoming academic year prepared and confident.\\nWith a full shopping cart, 5th grader Quentin confirmed his readiness, especially for his favorite class math. He made sure to purchase a ruler, pencils, and plenty of erasers. “It was good. I feel grateful. I don’t have to go back and get more because I got all of it,” he told me.\\n7th grader Ty-anna’s grin gave away her excitement. Armed with new supplies Ty-anna said, “I won’t be behind at school. This has helped me a lot. It makes me really happy.”\\nA smiley 3rd grader named We’am recognized that while she had fun shopping, she knew it was also helping out her mom who otherwise wouldn’t be able to afford new school supplies for We’am and her siblings.\\nSalvation Army Officer Captain Vance Murphy said, “It was neat watching the kids’ faces light up and listen to them talk about what they were going to buy. I don’t know who gets more out of this – the kids or volunteers.”\\nMajor Steve Morris from The Salvation Army’s National Area Command believes the benefits are shared evenly. “I think every volunteer here has said they’ve made a new friend. It’s more than just, ‘let’s go do this job.’ There’s a relationship built. That’s the Army’s touch. It’s equally beneficial.”\\nHis idea seemed to be proven by a particular Salvation Army volunteer and 8th grade shopper who both share the name Toni. As they checked out with the Target cashier, it was hard to tell who was more excited about the day’s shopping. 8th grader Toni said she couldn’t believe the generosity shown by Target and The Salvation Army, and especially her volunteer chaperone whom she had just met less than a few hours earlier. “I’m so happy! I’m so thankful!” she bubbled. Her chaperone added, “I’m in ecstasy with her joy. Her expression was worth every moment!” The two gave each other an emotional hug before heading outside with their bags.\\nThanks to Target’s generous partnership, today’s Back-to-School Spree was a huge success. Thousands of needy kids across the country are now prepared and excited to start their school year, while volunteers left equally inspired. Thank you to everyone who participated today, especially Target, who has shown a strong commitment to supporting children and education.\\nFor more pictures from today’s Back-to-School Spree, visit The Salvation Army’s Flickr page here.\\nP.S. We heard that at a Back-to-School Spree in Altoona, Pennsylvania some lucky kids got to shop with some local heroes! Players from the Altoona Curve, the area’s minor league baseball team, came out to volunteer as chaperones.

       " {'text': 'Issue 40 Hair Winter 2010/11\\nOf Mice and Mania\\nMy own brain is to me the most unaccountable of machinery—always buzzing, humming, soaring roaring diving, and then buried in mud. And why? What’s this passion for?\\nIf you give a mouse a haircut, he might want another. And another. And another. And it’s not actually a haircut. It’s a pluck. Sometimes a nibble. When a mouse goes to a barber, he or she loses some whiskers or some fur. And usually it happens again and again.\\nBarber mice, as they are known, remove the fur or whiskers of other mice (and somewhat less frequently, their own). They tend to be female, but aren’t always. And they are, as far as I can tell, only to be found among captive mouse populations, be they in laboratories or pet owners’ homes. The online message boards for mouse-rearing humans (who raise them as pets or for “fancy” mouse shows) are full of hair removal stories. They post photos of mice and rats with little bald spots on their heads, reverse mohawks, or hairless facial patches shaped like tiny Phantom of the Opera masks. Perplexed, the rodents’ keepers ask questions like, “Tache seems unable to go more than two weeks in a cage with other mice without beginning to barber again. … Today I returned her to the big tank with Pu Manchu and Mrs. Beach … but I expect by the end of two weeks she’ll be barbering again. How to solve this problem?”2\\nSome fanciers and breeders claim the behavior is about displaying dominance (i.e., the barbering mouse is boss). Others say it happens because of overcrowding or lack of stimulation: a lab mouse—even if it is born and bred to be one—still has sensory, social, and environmental needs that a cage, even a pleasant one filled with exercise wheels and colorful plastic tunnels, will have difficulty providing. What is not debatable is that barbering is simply normal grooming behavior gone awry. Usually mice groom by scratching themselves with their hind feet, washing their face or fur with their front paws (using their own saliva), and smoothing or cleaning their hair with their teeth. Barber mice take these behaviors in a more extreme direction by removing hair on others (and sometimes themselves) with their teeth. Barber mice don’t usually injure the mice whose fur or whiskers they nibble or pluck. In fact, it seems that their clients may enjoy it—that is, they will sometimes follow the barber mouse around until she or he plucks them—even when what results is the complete loss of whiskers or an un-ironic mouse mullet.3\\nGiven their extensive experience with mice in the laboratory, a few researchers have suggested that the barbering rodents might help us better understand overzealous hair removal in humans.4 In people, repetitive hair pulling (which leaves pluckers with bald spots and sometimes even interferes with their daily life) is diagnosed as trichotillomania.5 Not unlike mice, most human pluckers are female. The disorder affects roughly 1.5% of men and 3.5% of women in the United States,6 though trichotillomania may be far more widespread than we think because people are often embarrassed by their bald spots and can be quite good at covering them up. Studies using mice as stand-ins for human pluckers have tried various techniques to get the mice to start barbering in the first place (that is, if they haven’t started doing it themselves) and investigated the effects of antidepressants on the behavior. The fact that humans tend to pluck themselves and mice tend to pluck each other hasn’t stopped the use of mouse experimental models—since both the barber mouse and her client engage in the process by choice, even when it must be somewhat painful, researchers have tended to assume, for better or for worse, that the behavior found in a single human being is simply spread between two individual mice.\\nIn humans, the most common sites of plucking are the scalp, eyebrows, eyelashes, beard, and pubic area. People may start plucking one specific area, like eyebrows, but then, over time, switch to pulling from another region. Sufferers say that the plucking is usually preceded by some sort of tension that the pull itself releases, though it can also happen when people are relaxed or distracted (i.e., when reading a book or watching television).7 Nevertheless, anxiety, anger, and sadness often do increase the urgency and frequency of hair pulling.8\\nThere is still a good deal of confusion about how the disorder should be classified. The American Psychiatric Association’s Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders IV (DSM) has situated hair plucking under “Impulse-Control Disorders Not Elsewhere Classified” and counsels that this behavior should not be considered a compulsion. Unless plucking is associated with obsessive thoughts, the DSM stresses that it is also not an obsessive-compulsive disorder (since the plucking is not usually performed along a framework of rigid rules in the way that obsessive-compulsive hand-washing or lock-checking can be).\\nThe DSM’s claims notwithstanding, the behavior often does resemble a habit, an addiction, a tic, or an obsessive-compulsive disorder. More recently, researchers have begun to view it as part of a family of “body-focused repetitive behaviors,” along with skin picking and nail biting.”9 Whatever its etiology, trichotillomania is in the DSM because most people don’t do it. We need our hair for all sorts of reasons, some physiological, most not. Bald patches or missing eyebrows may make social situations more awkward and the time spent plucking may interfere with other things in one’s life. The habit might be a symptom of anxiety or depression, but mostly it just makes the sufferer look odd and this is when it tends to be diagnosed. Some trichotillomania sufferers, particularly children, may pull hair from other people, or even pets. And it is common for people to either play with, or eat, their plucked hairs.10\\nIn this, like so many of our neuroses, we are not alone. Hair pulling has been reported in six different non-human primate species, and, in addition to mice, has been observed among rats, guinea pigs, rabbits, sheep, musk oxen, dogs, and cats.11 Just as with mice, researchers who conducted a study on feather-plucking parrots suggested that they would be a good experimental model for trichotillomania-suffering humans.12 And like overgrooming dogs (who will sometimes lick themselves bare and oozy, a condition diagnosed as Acral Lick Dermatitis), birds have been treated with the same drugs used to treat compulsive behaviors in humans.\\nFor captive gorillas, the most common sites for hair plucking are forearms or shins, but I have seen plucked patches wherever the apes can reach. Gorillas, unlike us, can pluck almost anywhere since they have more and thicker body hair than we do. Some gorillas, like some people, eat their hair after plucking it.\\nAs primatologists such as Frans de Waal and Jane Goodall have observed, nonhuman animals can and do have culture, defined here as knowledge passed down from one generation to another or passed from one group to another, as in the famous case of Japanese macaques (Macaca fuscata) teaching one another to wash and season their yams in the ocean because the salted yams tasted better.13 So it may be with plucking—both in people and other animals. The babies of gorillas who pluck often turn out to be pluckers themselves. And troops that have never exhibited plucking sometimes start when a new plucker arrives in their midst. At the Franklin Park Zoo in Boston, none of the gorillas pulled out their hair until two young males—Little Joe and Okie—arrived in 1997 from Cleveland Metroparks Zoo. Within months, a number of the troop members in Boston were plucking.\\nJust as in humans, no one knows exactly why gorillas do it—except that, as it does for us, plucking may offer some sort of psychic balm or release of tension and it may be greatly influenced by one’s environment.14 There also may be a genetic component. An experiment conducted in 2002 demonstrated that mice bred without a group of key developmental genes (including the Hoxb8 gene, fundamental in the development of immune cells called microglia found in the brain) became severe self-barbers. The mutant mice didn’t stop at hair trimming and whisker plucking but also used their paws to scratch bald spots and sores on their rumps. A later study, published last May in the journal Cell, transplanted bone marrow (containing healthy microglia cells) from a group of control mice into the population of barbers. Four weeks after the transfer, when the new microglia had made it to the mutant mouse brains, many of the barber mice (who had been using their teeth to pluck the hair on their own chests, stomachs, and sides) stopped over-grooming. In three months, their hair had grown back.15 While no one is suggesting that human trichotillomania sufferers sign up for bone marrow transplants anytime soon, researchers are trying to understand the links between the brain’s immune system and the expression of mental disorders such as trichotillomania, OCD, autism, and depression.\\nLike the Hox genes themselves, overgrooming behaviors may be present, in some form or another, in all vertebrates with something to pluck, lick, or pull out. While such behaviors are probably not attributable to genetics alone, a predisposition to over-grooming may exist in certain individuals, who when exposed to the right combination of stressors exhibit such behaviors. Within the avian veterinary literature, feather plucking—termed “Feather-Picking Disorder” or “Feather Destructive Behavior” if it is unrelated to a separate medical condition, such as allergies—can stem from boredom, frustration, and stress, or be related to sexual behavior, premature weaning, attention seeking, overcrowding, separation anxiety, and/or changes in routine. Virtually anything that could be upsetting to a parrot can trigger the behavior.\\nPhoebe Greene Linden has lived with parrots for more than twenty-five years and is an expert on captive parrot behavior—fielding questions from hundreds of parrot owners online and in person. She claims that “solutions to stopping feather destructive behavior are as individual as strategies tailored for human individuals. Enriching their environments and helping them learn new behaviors when the parrot is healthy, ready to learn, physically active and mentally engaged, is best. And making sure that they have opportunities to fly, forage, and socialize is key.”16 However, in chronic cases, SRRI’s like Prozac have been useful, as have Xanax, Valium, and other medications.\\nA group of cockatoos who plucked their feathers responded (albeit somewhat unevenly) to Clomipramine, a tricyclic anti-depressant sold under the brand name Anafranil and most often prescribed to humans as an anti-obsessional medication.17 Another study on both plucking cockatoos and African greys tested their response to a different antidepressant, Doxepin (it worked, but not uniformly, for most parrots involved in the study). And veterinary staff at the Tufts Animal Behavior Clinic in Massachusetts documented the marked effect of SSRI’s like Prozac on feather picking in Amazonian, African grey, and Eclectus parrots.18\\nThe question underlying all of this—especially the experiments on over-grooming mice, birds, cats, dogs, and other nonhumans—is whether or not these animals’ behaviors can actually shed light on ours. Just because plucking in mice, gorillas, or cockatoos resembles our own, does it mean that the nonhuman in question is having similar thoughts? Of course, we cannot know. Even in the realm of human relationships, we all know that just because you ask a person what they’re thinking or how they’re feeling doesn’t mean that they’ll be able to tell you—they may not know why they’re pulling their hair out, or even how they feel when they do it.\\nShared language in no way guarantees revelation between two beings. Just as we seek to understand mental states in humans who can’t (or won’t) talk to us, I believe we should do the same with other animals. Critics may consider this just another form of anthropomorphism, but I think that is far too narrow a view. We have long looked to other animals to better understand ourselves—using them as experimental subjects, objects of philosophical inquiry, companions with whom we soothe or challenge ourselves, or as the raw material of moral lessons. Human relationships with other animals continue to center around observations and a certain amount of projection is inherent to the act of watching and interpreting what other animals are doing with their time. Our lives with other creatures are rife with instances of both good and bad projections. A human who takes Spot to the door on a rainy afternoon might see the dog pause at the threshold, nose in the air. Depending on the person, this might be understood to mean, “Spot hates going outside in the rain and so I should buy him a cute little slicker and set of rain boots so that he’ll go out without a fuss.”\\nWithin the scientific community, fear of projections like this one have sometimes crippled our understanding of shared animal experience. Anthropomorphism, or the attribution of “human” characteristics to nonhuman animals or objects, has been something of a dirty word in the behavioral sciences. Such fears have long informed studies such as one I once worked on in southeast Alaska. We were observing grizzly bears and their interactions with human fishermen along a salmon stream in Katmai National Park. The same bears came back summer after summer to fish, bicker, and raise their cubs and were easily recognizable by their scars, fishing styles, and personalities. And yet, as researchers, we were instructed only to use numbers to refer to the bears lest our use of human names for them might cause us to attribute human desires and thoughts to the bears as well. But outside of our official survey forms and notes, we all used names for them, like “Diver” for a bear who was fond of diving to the bottom of the river to catch his salmon. As far as I know, calling him Diver did not encourage us to assume that he was engaged in anything but bearish behavior—but that was the concern.\\nThankfully, such practices have begun to change somewhat. The Stanford neuroscientist Robert Sapolsky, for example, has long used Biblical names to refer to individual baboons he studies in Kenya. Despite the holy handles, his work has not suffered and neither has that of the numerous other scientists who have more recently veered into what may have, not long ago, seemed like anthropomorphic territory. In Sapolsky’s case, it may even have helped—getting to know the personalities of his individual baboons, on their own terms and his, may have encouraged him to make the leap that their stress responses approximated our own, research that has since revolutionized how we think of the affects of chronic and acute stress on the human brain.\\nProjecting, in and of itself, is not a problem. And if this wasn’t true, animal models for mental disorders from trichotillomania to depression would simply not be as present in the scientific literature as they are. This isn’t to say they aren’t problematic. We cannot assume that a rat=parrot=dog=human. But if it sounds like a duck, walks like a duck, and plucks like a human—it just may be a duck we can identify with.\\nLaurel Braitman is a historian and anthropologist of science currently completing her doctorate at MIT.

       " {'text': 'So what’s the story with the daughters of Zelofchad? In this week’s parsha they stand up for their rights. They demand to inherit their late father’s share of the Land of Israel, side by side with his brothers. Moses asks G-d what to do, and He takes their side. So women are equal, right?\\nPerhaps… until next week. Next week we come to the end of Bamidbar and what do we find? The men are worried the daughters of Zelofchad will marry out of the tribe and the land will slip out of tribal hands. Moses goes to G-d on this too, but this time the outcome isn’t quite so women-friendly. The daughters of Zelofchad must marry their cousins.\\nWhat’s up with that?!\\nWell, I’m afraid those of us who expect to find full fledged feminism and an unequivocal demand for equality from women who lived over three thousand years ago will be disappointed. Even the sisters’ original request never amounted to a demand for full equality.\\nThe good news is that at least according to midrash, the actions of Tirzah, Noah, Milka, Hogla and Mahla do reflect a higher ideal of equality that society can strive for.\\nA demand for full equality would have required women and men to inherit their parents equally. If this is what the sisters were after, we would expect them to cry out; to say that as women they were being wronged and demand justice; at the very least we would expect them to site equality as a basis for their demand. But what the daughters actually said was: ‘Why should the name of our father be done away from among his family, because he had no son?’ (Bamidbar 27:4) Even once their request was granted, it wasn’t their own names they set out to save, nor the name of their mother that has indeed been lost to history, but their father’s name. Their motivation was the same as the one expected by the Torah of a woman whose husband died before they had children. A man who dies needs a man with the same name to continue working his land. They were asking that their male children carry on their father’s name and work in his plot. Why this would be so important is an interesting question for a different discussion, but it is clearly not founded on a feminist worldview. On the contrary, it’s obvious that the daughters’ entire identity was subsumed by the men in their lives, and their request rested on the assumptions of the patriarchal society of which they were a part.\\nBut is society’s point of view the same as G-d’s point of view? When the society we are talking about is the people of Israel, following divine revelation, we may be tempted to answer with a resonating yes. Surprisingly, the story of the daughters of Zelofchad proves otherwise.\\nWhen the daughters consider their deceased father’s loss at not having someone to continue his name, they aren’t acting out of concern for themselves or out of feminist ideals; they’re moved by love for their father. Through the lens of love, the norms of patriarchal society are meaningless. What does it matter, they ask, if our father had sons or daughters? As the midrash puts it:\\nWhen the daughters of Zelofchad heard that the Land was to be parceled out to males but not to females, they got together to take counsel from each other and they said: ‘Heaven’s mercy is unlike the mercy of humans. People have mercy only for males, but He who spoke and created the world has mercy for males and females alike… as it is written: “and His tender mercies are over all His works” (Psalms 145:9)',\n",

Using multispectral imagery and linear spectral unmixing techniques for estimating crop yield variability. Transactions of the ASABE. 50(2):667-674. Interpretive Summary: Vegetation indices calculated from remote sensing imagery are commonly used to estimate crop plant growth and yield, but most of these indices use only two spectral bands in the image. This study evaluated linear spectral unmixing techniques, which can use all the bands in the image, for estimating yield variability from airborne multispectral imagery. Linear spectral unmixing models were applied to five time-sequential airborne images collected from a grain sorghum field to generate crop plant and soil abundance images. Plant and soil abundance data were significantly related to grain yield with equivalent or better correlations compared with the normalized difference vegetation index. These results indicate that linear spectral unmixing techniques can be used alone or in conjunction with traditional vegetation indices for quantifying crop canopy cover and mapping crop yield.\\nTechnical Abstract: Vegetation indices derived from multispectral imagery are commonly used to extract crop growth and yield information. Spectral unmixing techniques provide an alternative approach to quantifying crop canopy abundance within each image pixel and have the potential for mapping crop yield variability. The objective of this study was to apply linear spectral unmixing techniques to airborne multispectral imagery for estimating grain sorghum yield variability. Five time-sequential airborne multispectral images and yield monitor data collected from a grain sorghum field were used for this study. Both unconstrained and constrained linear spectral unmixing models were applied to the images to generate crop plant and soil abundances for each image and all 26 multi-image combinations of the five images. Correlation analysis showed that yield was significantly related to unconstrained and constrained plant and soil abundances. For comparison, yield was also related to the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and the green NDVI (GNDVI). Results showed that unconstrained plant abundance had better correlations with yield than NDVI for all five images. Although GNDVI had better correlations with yield for the first three images, unconstrained plant abundance derived from the fourth image provided the best overall correlation with yield (r=0.88). Moreover, multi-image combinations generally improved the correlations with yield over single images and the best three-image combination resulted in the highest overall correlation (r=0.90) between yield and unconstrained plant abundance. These results indicate that linear spectral unmixing techniques can be a useful tool for quantifying crop canopy abundance and mapping crop yield.',\n",

       " {'text': '- An African pope would show that African Catholicism has come of age, says Stan Chu Ilo\\n- Latin America and Africa account for more than half of the world\\'s Catholics\\n- Pope Benedict XVI has described Africa as a \"Spiritual Lung\" for humanity\\n- Stan Chu Ilo asks: Is the Catholic Church ready for a black pope?\\nCardinal John Onaiyekan of Abuja, Nigeria, was asked last week at the celebration of Black History Month in Toronto if he thought that the time was ripe for an African pope. His answer attracted much cheering from the crowd of over 500 Catholics of African descent.\\nHe said: \"The time for an African pope was ripe even in the time of the Apostolic Fathers in the first century of the church.\\n\"I am not saying that I wish to be considered for the papacy, but the fact that the Gospel is to be preached to all peoples, languages, and races means that the highest leadership of the church should be open to anyone from any race, language and nation. I will not be surprised to see an African pope in my lifetime.\"\\nNone of us who listened to him expected that a week later, the prospect of an African pope will be put to the test in the next conclave in March as a result of the sudden resignation of Pope Benedict XVI.\\nFor many Catholics, where a pope comes from may not be as important as who the pope is, but for most African Catholics the election of an African pope will be a wonderful sign that African Catholicism has come of age, and they hope that such a pope will address squarely the particular challenges facing Africans today and integrate African culture and socio-economic priorities into mainstream Catholicism.\\nWithin the last three decades there has been a shift in global Catholicism. The center of gravity in World Christianity has moved from the West to the global South.\\nThis is not only with regard to African Catholicism but to African Christianity in general. British Missiologist Andrew Walls argues: \"African Christianity must be seen as a major component of contemporary representative Christianity, the standard Christianity of the present age, a demonstration model of its character. That is, we need to look at Africa today, in order to understand Christianity itself.\"\\nThis is a view shared by many who watch the exponential growth and diversity of African Christianity at a time when Catholicism is dying in the heartland of Europe, weakened by sexual abuse, a crisis of leadership, and a crisis of faith and secularism.\\nAccording to recent figures, 70% of Catholics now live in either in the Americas (48%) or in Europe (24%) and more than a quarter live either in the Asia-Pacific region (12%) or in Sub-Saharan Africa (16%).\\nFor the first time in history, Latin America and Africa provide more than half of the population of Catholics in the world today.\\nAt a time when the pews and churches of Europe and North America are empty and many dioceses are declaring bankruptcy, the churches in Africa are filled beyond capacity every Sunday. At a time when European church celebrations are seen to be too formal, too medieval and ritualistic, and lacking in joy and flavor, church celebrations in Africa are very enthusiastic, celebratory, communal and joyful.\\nThere is always something new and surprising in many African churches on Sunday, reflecting the unpredictable innovation and openness of African religious beliefs and practices to the dynamist of the Holy Spirit. As one White Canadian who attended our African Mass in Toronto told me recently: African Catholicism rocks!\\nWhereas there is a frightening drop in vocations to the priesthood and religious life in North America and Europe, religious vocations are booming in Africa and African clerics are all over the Western world helping in the re-evangelization of the descendants of the Western missionaries who brought Christianity to Africa.\\nCatholicism is also a strong cultural influence in Africa\\'s continuing search for answers to the challenges of poverty, diseases, ethnic and religious conflicts, wars, political and economic problems, radical Islamic fundamentalism, and how to mitigate the effects of climate change and natural disasters.\\nChurches in Africa are becoming strong social capitals whose values lie not simply in providing spiritual support, but also in strengthening the civil society, creating healthy networks among people and valorizing the agency of Africans to safeguard basic human security for integral and sustainable development.\\nPope Benedict XVI also recognizes this shift. In November 2011, Pope Benedict XVI was in Contonou, Benin, to unveil the post-Apostolic Exhortation, Africae Munus, which contained the road map of the Second African Synod for the future of African Christianity. Among other things, Pope Benedict argued that Africa has become the spiritual lungs which will awaken the sleeping churches of the West, and that Africa should also become the center for the renewal of Catholic thought, philosophy and theology.\\nPope Benedict thus sees African Catholicism and African Catholics as well placed to lead Christianity to the future. The election of an African pope will no doubt vindicate Africa\\'s place as the new center of Catholicism and world Christianity.\\nThe fundamental questions are: Is the Catholic church ready for a black pope? Will the church, which defines herself as universal, live up to the full consequences of her identity and give room to a new reality that could help reconnect the church to the movement of history which it seems to have abandoned under the papacy of Pope Benedict?\\nWill the Catholic Church accept Africa\\'s brand of Catholicism and will an African pope be more Roman than African? Is an African pope better placed to address the challenges facing Africa today as well as give new energy and renewal to a tired church in the West?\\nHowever, whoever becomes the next pope -- African or non-African -- should see himself as a pope for the world. He should not become a prisoner of the Vatican or to a eurocentric medieval notion of Roman Catholicism or orthodoxy.\\nFurthermore, he should not become a slave to some of the time-worn structures and teachings of the Catholic Church.\\nOn the contrary, he should go out to the ends of the earth and reach out to all people, especially those disenchanted and marginal Catholics -- women divorced and separated Catholics, gays and lesbians, victims of clerical sexual abuse, and those who feel alienated from the church because of some of its sterner moral and spiritual prescriptions.\\nThe boundaries of ethical and doctrinal discourse are shifting in a radical way. It should be the task of the new pope to help make the Catholic Church a community of faith of people of many colors; a church that embraces social change and cultures as a friend, and endorses through her laws and practices the dignity of differences.\\nThis way, the Catholic Church will become truly a household of God, where blacks and whites, saints and sinners, men and women, liberals and conservatives, rich and poor, gays and straights are all treated as equal children of God, without regard to rank or status.',\n",

Then, since lupus vulgaris is also\\nknown as tuberculosis of the skin, Gerson had the inspiration to\\nbegin treating people suffering from other forms of tuberculosis. In\\n1933, he published his book, Dietary Therapy of Lung Tuberculosis.\\nUnfortunately, the rise of Hitler to power in Germany meant that he\\nwas unable to publicly demonstrate his discoveries to the Berlin\\nMedical Association. Paced with a deteriorating political situation\\nin his homeland Dr. Gerson went to work in Vienna and\\nFrance, as well as giving lectures throughout Europe. Finally, as\\nthe clouds of war gathered ever more ominously over Europe, Gerson\\nleft Europe in 1936 to begin a new life in America.\\nUnfortunately for Dr. Gerson - not to mention the thousands upon\\nthousands of people who could have been helped by his therapy - the\\nU.S., while a haven from Hitler, was far from being the land of the\\nfree. Gerson found that publishing his work - which was a relatively\\neasy proposition in Europe - was an almost impossible task in the\\nPerhaps part of the reason why Gerson\\'s work was not\\nenthusiastically supported by his medical peers in the United States\\nmay have been that he was German, and therefore to be treated with\\nsuspicion, as a member of an enemy nation, even though he had\\nqualified to practice medicine in the United States in 1938.\\nHowever, a more important reason was that his treatments for cancer\\nchallenged the orthodox methods. In the 1930s and 1940s, according\\nto the orthodox mind-set, cancer was to be treated in two basic\\nways: surgically to remove the offending tumor (when it was\\noperable) and then with radiation to kill the cancerous cells.\\nDr. Gerson\\'s conception of cancer went far beyond merely viewing the\\ncancer as a spontaneous eruption within a healthy body. Rather he\\nsaw cancer as the end result of generalized degradation of the\\nbodily systems, especially the liver. Such concepts were quite\\nforeign to the vast majority of the medical profession at that time,\\nwhen doctors could not adequately account for the cause of cancer,\\nnor inform people how to avoid this life threatening disease.\\nAccording to Gerson, the way to prevent cancer was by,\\n\"...preventing damage to the liver. The basic\\nmeasure of prevention is not to eat the damaged, dead, poisoned\\nfood which we bring into our bodies. Every day, day by day, we\\npoison our bodies.\"\\nGerson\\'s nutritional therapy worked on the principle\\nthat in order to cure a serious disorder such as cancer, treatment\\nof the symptoms of the disease was not sufficient to restore the\\npatient to health.\\nHe wrote in his book\\nA Cancer Therapy - Results of\\nFifty Cases in 1958 that the \"whole body\" or \"whole metabolism\" had\\nto be treated to \"correct all the vital processes\" in order to\\neffect a cure.\\nThe basis of Dr. Gerson\\'s nutritional program to strengthen the body\\nto allow healing to take place is a diet comprised mostly of raw\\nfoods, especially freshly-made fruit and vegetable juices, green\\nsalad, and a soup cooked at a very low heat. Some cooked fruit and\\nvegetables are also permitted in the first six weeks of his dietary\\nplan. However, no canned, salted, pickled, bleached, sulphured,\\nfrozen or smoked foods in short no denatured foods of any kind - are\\npermitted at any time during the Gerson regime.\\nThe therapy Dr. Gerson devised was also designed to be high in\\npotassium and low in sodium.\\nThe soup mentioned above is especially\\nhigh in potassium, which helped to correct a too-high ratio of\\nsodium to potassium suffered by many people with cancer, especially\\nthose with moderate or advanced cancer. Dr. Gerson discovered that\\nrestoring a favorable potassium/sodium balance could reverse some of\\nthe cell damage caused by an excess of sodium.\\nThe function of the freshly-made fruit and vegetable juices in the\\nprogram is to detoxify the body and provide oxidizing enzymes to\\nassist in the rehabilitation of the liver. Other techniques to\\nsupport the liver and detoxify the body are also used in the\\nprogram, including coffee enemas to stimulate the flow of bile and\\nsafely dispose of toxins, the juice of raw calves\\' liver, and\\ninjections of crude liver extract.\\n(Liver juices and extracts are no longer used by\\npeople following a Gerson program in the 1990s, due to the\\ncontamination of the liver with pesticides and bacteria. Spirulina\\nand carrot juice may be taken instead to provide nutritional iron\\nand pro-vitamin A. Desiccated liver tablets may be used instead,\\nsince these are thought to contain fewer toxins.)\\nGerson also supplemented the diet of people in his care with\\naddition-al potassium salts, as well as organic and inorganic\\niodine. Fluoride-contaminated water or other products are forbidden\\nbecause of fluoride\\'s toxicity to valuable enzymes.\\nAnimal fats are\\nexcluded. Dr. Gerson\\'s program was originally completely free of\\nfats and oils (excluding the small amount of fat present in the\\ncalves\\' liver), but after experimentation, Gerson modified his\\nprogram to include a small amount of flax seed oil to supply\\nessential fatty acids.\\nAfter six weeks of detoxification using the diet and supplements\\nout-lined above, patients in Gerson\\'s care graduated to a diet which\\nincluded small amounts of the protein foods such as yogurt, cottage\\ncheese, and natural buttermilk. (Foods containing protein had been\\npreviously restricted to allow the body adequate time to detoxify\\nand begin to break down tumor tissue.)\\nThese, then, were the basic theories and therapy which Dr. Gerson\\nhad developed by the time that he came to the United States in 1936.\\nIn January 1948 - almost twenty years after he had first successfully\\ntreated cancer in Germany in 1928 - he went to work at New York\\'s\\nGotham Hospital. However, Gerson\\'s efforts to publish his\\ndiscoveries consistently met with a negative response from the\\npublishers of medical journals.\\nHis article \"Cancer, A Deficiency Disease\" was rejected by the New\\nYork State Journal of Medicine in 1943.\\nThe next year another paper,\\n\"Dietic Treatment of Malignant Tumors,\" was also rejected by every\\nmedical journal to which it had been sent. In 1945, he finally\\nsucceeded in publishing \"Dietary Considerations in Malignant\\nNeoplastic Disease,\" which appeared in the November-December edition\\nof Review of Gastroenterology.\\nHis work might have been destined to\\nobscurity forever, but for an investigative reporter who discovered\\nthe good doctor working quietly to cure cancer with his most\\nunorthodox therapies, and determined to bring Dr. Gerson\\'s\\nlife-saving discoveries to public attention.\\nRaymond Swing, an ABC radio journalist, proposed that Dr. Gerson be\\ncalled to testify before the Senate which was debating a bill to\\nallocate funds for cancer research. Raymond Swing\\'s efforts on Dr.\\nGerson\\'s behalf were successful and the doctor, together with five\\nof his patients, went before a sub-committee of the Senate in 1946\\nand told their stories.\\nAll of the five patients had had a positive\\nresponse to Dr. Gerson\\'s therapy, and had been told by their former\\ndoctors that there was no longer any hope for them.\\na woman with breast cancer who had undergone\\nmastectomy and radiation treatments to no avail. Her cancer had\\ndisappeared after nine months of the Gerson therapy; a fifteen\\nyear old girl had been paralyzed by a tumor in her spinal cord.\\nHer tumor had vanished after 8 months of Gerson therapy;\\na soldier with an inoperable tumor which had\\ngrown from his neck into his skull, making radiation treatment\\nimpossible because of the risk of brain damage - a year after\\ncommencing the Gerson therapy he was completely free of cancer;\\na woman who had suffered from a malignant\\nsarcoma. Prior to beginning the Gerson therapy, she had large\\ntumors in her groin, neck and abdomen. After a year on the\\nGerson therapy she was completely free of cancer.\\nUnfortunately, Dr. Gerson\\'s successful treatment of\\nthese and other patients who otherwise had been doomed to die did\\nnot earn him the respect and recognition from the medical community\\nthat he deserved.\\nQuite to the contrary.\\nThe public display of Dr. Gerson\\'s successful but unorthodox treatment of cancer victims\\nfurther alienated him from main-stream medicine. An abusive\\neditorial in the Journal of the American Medical Association in\\nNovember 1946 followed Dr. Gerson\\'s appearance in front of the\\nThe editorial celebrated the unfortunate fact that,\\ndespite the amazing and incredibly newsworthy results of Dr.\\nGerson\\'s therapy, his presentation before the Senate sub-committee\\n\"little, if any newspaper publicity\"\\n- as if the\\nlack of mainstream publicity itself was an indictment of the\\ntreatment! The editor further denigrated his work by splitting\\nhairs as to what precisely constituted a \"cure.\"\\nDr. Gerson, he wrote,\\n\"admits lack of any actual cure, claiming only\\nthat patients seemed improved in health and that some tumors\\nwere delayed in growth or became smaller.\"\\nIn one final coup against Dr. Gerson, who for years\\nhad been submitting work to the journal for publication without\\nsuccess, he wrote that,\\n\"the journal has on several occasions requested\\nDr. Gerson supply details of the method of treatment but has\\nthus far received no satisfactory reply.\"\\nThis editorial was just the beginning of a\\nconcentrated campaign of harassment against Dr. Gerson and the\\npeople who were working with him in his Research Foundation. Between\\n1946 and 1954, Dr. Gerson was investigated five times by the Medical\\nSociety of the County of New York. After each investigation, the\\nResearch Foundation requested that the investigators give a\\nstatement, and in each case the request was denied.\\nHowever, in 1948, Dr. Gerson and his Research Foundation were left\\nin no doubt as to what the medical establishment thought of them\\nwhen a review of their work was published in the Journal of the AMA.\\nThe review was entitled \"Frauds and Fables,\" in which the journal\\nsuggested that Gerson was a fraud. The Research Foundation\\nthreatened to sue the AMA and were able to stop reprints of the\\ndamaging article. However, as a con-sequence of the damaging\\npublicity, Gotham Hospital refused to allow Dr. Gerson to work on\\nits premises after 1950.\\nMoreover, Dr. Gerson was not able to restore his good name within\\nthe medical profession in America. It became impossible for him to\\npublish a single piece of research in any medical journal from the\\nend of 1949 until the end of his life, despite (or perhaps because\\nof) his thousands of success stories.\\nIn addition, Gerson was\\nprevented from presenting patients at a hearing of the House of\\nCommerce Committee in 1953, which was investigating therapies for\\ncancer and other diseases. Despite requests from his patients that\\nhe be allowed to present his findings, as well as a letter from Dr.\\nGerson himself, the chairman of the committee failed to offer Dr.\\nGerson the chance to demonstrate his findings.\\nWith his work increasingly under fire in the United States, Dr.\\nGerson went to Europe in order to publish his discoveries. A German\\njournal, Medizinische Klinik, published two of the reports which\\nU.S. journals had refused to print: \"Cancer: A Problem of\\nMetabolism\" and \"No Cancer in Normal Metabolism.\" He was also\\ninvited to the University of Zurich in 1952, after attending the\\nInternational Cancer Congress in Berchtesgaden.\\nWhen Dr. Gerson returned to the United States from Europe, however,\\nhe faced still more hurdles. In 1957, he was investigated by the\\nLicensing Board of New York State. Even more damaging to his work,\\nhis malpractice insurance was terminated.\\nIn 1958 Gerson was\\nsuspended from the Medical Society of the State of New York, and the\\nlaboratories which Dr. Gerson\\'s Research Foundation used for X-rays,\\nblood, and urine analyses were warned that should they continue to\\ndo work for Dr. Gerson and his patients, they would be put out of\\nbusiness. Dr. Gerson died in 1959.\\nThe harassment of Dr. Gerson by the medical establishment, while\\nboth unethical and immoral, is understandable within a commercial\\ncontext. If Gerson\\'s methods of curing cancer had replaced the\\n\"conventional\" cancer treatments, the profession\\'s investment in\\nexpensive equipment such as surgical facilities and radiation\\ntreatment apparatus would have been lost, to say nothing of\\nHowever, it was not just Dr. Gerson and his colleagues who had to\\nPatients who sought out the Gerson treatment in\\npreference to orthodox medicine were also harassed by members of the\\northodox medical community. In many cases, doctors harangued\\npatients so persistently that they abandoned Gerson\\'s therapy - even\\nwhen it appeared to be helping them - and accepted conventional\\nmedical treatment for their cancer.\\nThese tactics compelled Gerson to write to a close\\nfriend in 1957 that:\\nThe most difficult and inhuman part of the\\nmeasures taken against me is that the physicians approach the\\nbest and almost completely cured patients and try to have them\\nreturned to their hospitals. Here they man-age with orthodox\\ntreatments to kill them. I lose in this manner some-where\\nbetween 25 and 30 percent of my best cases.\\nThis sort of harassment of people using the Gerson\\ntherapy occurred even after Dr. Gerson\\'s death, with doctors going\\nas far as phoning patients in residence at the La Gloria Hospital\\nin Mexico, which was set up in 1977 to provide Dr. Gerson\\'s therapy\\non an in-patient basis.\\nIn 1998, the climate of mainstream medical hostility towards Dr.\\nGerson\\'s unorthodox therapy program has not changed. \"Anti-quackery\"\\nlaws forbid the practice of the Gerson therapy in California and\\nother states of the U.S. by medical doctors. People with cancer who\\nreject the options of surgery, radiation and chemotherapy offered to\\nthem by the major cancer hospitals must either struggle to pursue a Gerson-type program in their own homes without adequate medical\\nsupport, or find the money necessary to travel to Mexico and pay for\\ntreatment at La Gloria Hospital, near Tijuana.\\nThe parents of a growing number of children with cancer are even\\nless able to choose what they believe is the most suitable treatment\\noption for their son and daughter, since by law all children in the\\nUnited States who have cancer must be given chemotherapy, or their\\nparents may be imprisoned. Even a demonstrable improvement in the\\nchild\\'s condition using non-toxic methods of cancer treatment will\\nnot forestall the application of this barbarous law.\\nGerson\\'s therapy remains on the \"Unproven Methods List\" of the\\nAmerican Cancer Society, despite ample evidence in Dr. Gerson\\'s book\\nA Cancer Therapy: The Results of Fifty Cases, as well as testimony\\nfrom former cancer patients whose cancerous conditions have been\\nhealed by Gerson\\'s techniques.\\nDr. Gerson\\'s therapy has now been practiced for over\\n60 years, and patients of La Gloria Hospital experience an average\\nimprovement rate of 80 percent in early to moderate cancer and even\\nmore amazingly a 40-50 percent rate of improvement in people with\\nso-called \"terminal\" cancer. Other benefits of the Gerson therapy\\nfor cancer sufferers included a marked reduction in pain, and also\\ncontrol of the acute infections which often led to the death of\\n(The clinic does however, have a general rule of not\\naccepting people who have previously undergone chemotherapy, since\\ndue to the damage that chemotherapeutic drugs inflict upon the liver\\nand other organs of the body, sustained improvement in the condition\\nof these cancer patients is much less likely.

By comparison, just 6\\npercent of 194 patients under the care of the Eastern Cooperative\\nOncology Group survived five years.\\nDespite these impressive results of Dr. Gerson\\'s therapies,\\nmainstream medicine is even less receptive to his ideas and\\ntreatment plans now than when he began publishing the results of his\\nwork in the United States in the 1940s.\\nIn January 1945, the then manager-director of the American Cancer\\nSociety Mr. C. C. Little wrote (to a doctor):\\nIt seems to me that since Dr. Gerson has frankly\\nstated in detail what his diet is and in addition has given the\\ntheory on which he personally believes its claimed efficacy is\\nbased, that his material should receive publication and proper\\nattention and criticism by the medical profession.

While some question the focus on the jolly bearded red-suited figure during the Christmas season, many businessmen involved in Christmas-themed enterprises feel there is no conflict between the Santa Claus story and the Nativity story.\\nCarla Bronner Spletzer is vice president of Bronner\\'s CHRISTmas Wonderland, a Frankenmuth, Mich.-based business that boasts of being \"The World Largest Christmas Store.\"\\nSpletzer told The Christian Post she remembered growing up with Santa Claus as part of the celebration of the birth of Jesus and that there was no conflict seen between the two stories.\\n\"Santa is based on Christian religious beliefs. Santa was inspired by St. Nicholas who was a priest (in southern area of Turkey) that helped the poor and needy. St. Nicholas\\' giving was based on his love for Jesus,\" said Spletzer.\\n\"Santa brings presents to good girls & boys on Christmas. Christmas is Jesus\\' birthday and that is why we get/give presents … as a reminder of Jesus\\' birthday & God\\'s gift to us of His son Jesus, our Savior.\"\\nSpletzer also told CP that when her children were young, one way they would celebrate Christmas was to \"decorate a giant cookie for Jesus\\' birthday on Christmas.\"\\nDespite selling the usual seasonal items including lights, Santa suits, and \"snowbunnies,\" throughout its website Bronner\\'s has the first six letters in Christmas spelled with capital letters as a reminder of the main reason for the season.\\n\"Enjoy CHRISTmas, It\\'s HIS birthday. Enjoy LIFE, It\\'s HIS Way,\" reads the company\\'s motto placed at the front of their store.\\nPeggy Chappell, owner of the Dallas-based Noel Christmas Store, told The Christian Post about how as with many American homes Santa Claus and the Nativity Story were both part of her childhood.\\n\"As a child I remember being told that Santa Claus would come at Christmas with gifts, but we had to be good children. We had to go to grandma\\'s house so that Santa could arrive with the gifts,\" said Chappell. \"But I also remember going to church and being told about the birth of Christ and that was why we were celebrating Christmas.\"\\nDespite believing that \"the story of Santa lives on\" for American children, Chappell said that she felt materialism had infused itself with the Santa Claus story.\\n\"I still believe that it is a wonderful magic for children to believe in, but I feel that it has become too commercialized,\" said Chappell. \"The true meaning and spirit of Christmas has been diminished. It has come to the point of some retailers remaining open on Christmas day so they can make those \\'extra sales.\\'\"\\nThe popular imagery of Santa Claus in American Christmas tradition, while mostly stemming from the early church life of Saint Nicholas, was nevertheless a relatively recent creation.\\nAndrew Crislip, associate professor at the Department of History at Virginia Commonwealth University and an expert in Christian history, told The Christian Post that much of the modern Santa Claus mythology comes from the Victorian Era.\\n\"I cannot see much in the way of similarities between early church tradition about St. Nicholas and the contemporary portrait, which is more a product of 19th and 20th century popular culture,\" said Crislip.\\nAccording to Crislip, Saint Nicholas\\' story mostly comes from church tradition and that veneration of St. Nicholas in any way came long after his death.\\n\"While church tradition holds that St. Nicholas was a bishop in what is today Turkey in the early fourth century, there is not much evidence for any veneration of him until the sixth century, and he only became widely venerated much later than that,\" said Crislip.\\n\"Church tradition holds that he was arrested during the Great Persecution (303-306), but not executed. Historians tend to view such stories of saints arrested, tortured, and executed during times of persecution with great skepticism.\"',\n",

       " {'text': 'Last season’s ultimate denoument revealed Spurs to be one of the unluckiest clubs in Europe. Having had an exhilarating season under Harry Redknapp, and despite suffering an end of season loss of form, the White Hart Lane club still managed to secure fourth spot in the Premier League. In every other year of the competition, this would have seen them qualify for at least a qualifying round of the Champions’ League.\\nWho could however have expected that Chelsea would confound predictions on a number of successive occasions and go on to secure the trophy in Bayern Munich’s backyard. That outstanding success for one London club meant disappointment for another one. It meant that – unlike Everton, when caught in a similar dilemma a few years back - Spurs, cruelly had their place snatched away. Soon afterwards Redknapp was gone, and it was back to the drawing board.\\nThis season, with AVB at the helm, Spurs have shown that last season was no fluke, and go into the final half-dozen or so games in position to correct the perceived inequity of last year. All seemed to be going swimmingly until last week, when an injury to the talismanic Gareth Bale in the game against Basel suddenly seemed to shake the team’s self-belief. The game ended in a dispiriting 2-2 draw, and put a serious question mark over Spurs’ ability to progress in the Europa League. Suddenly, what could have previously looked like a fairly run-of-the-mill game against Everton on Sunday assumed the proportions of a major challenge, and one in which Spurs needed to demonstrate a steel and determination to see things through. Unfortunately, things didn’t turn out that way, and despite taking an early lead, only a late goal managed to secure them the cold comfort of a draw. It was certainly a case of two points less than expectations demanded. The spectre now has been raised of ‘another Spurs blow-up.” Many people are ready to hang the label of ‘serial bottlers’ around the players’ necks. By the time Spurs take to the field in the league again, on 21st April, at home to Manchester City – no easy task, of course – it is entirely possible that they will be out of the top four.\\nIn such times, a team needs strong characters to step up to the plate and dismiss doubts. No surprise then that as well as manager AVB, a number of players have stepped up to declare their faith in the team securing the coveted top four place. Clint Dempsey has declared his confidence that their aspirations can be met, despite the inevitable tense atmosphere gripping the squad. His stance has been supported by other players such as relative newcomer Lewis Holtby. Confidence can be a fragile commodity, and doubt can swiftly transfer from players to fans, and back again. Such a ‘front foot’ stance by the club therefore is very much the required response.\\nWith the prospect of Bale, Lennon and Defoe to return in the coming weeks, there’s no reason for Spurs’ fans to panic, and on the season’s form, they undoubtedly have the quality to get back on track in no time flat. The Manchester City game has now almost acquired a ‘must win’ status. On form, it’s a task not beyond Spurs, and success against the reigning champions is just the confidence booster required. Should the result go against them however, the tension will be ratcheted up another couple of notches, and the tantalising prize could elude them for another season.',\n",

Brown, a first-team All-Valley offensive lineman, helped San Dimas to 407 yards per game.

The two teams play a little earlier this season and with records not as shiny as the 8-1 mark with which each entered last season’s clash, but a league championship could be on the line just the same when they meet Friday at San Dimas.\\nSchedule changes: San Dimas (3-2) and Baldwin Park (1-4) may not win any beauty contests at this point but difficult nonleague schedules in 2010 may have each playing better than last season.\\nPomona isn’t usually the subject of the most curiosity in the Inland Valley. Given that it has a two-time CIF champion coach on the sideline this year, the Red Devils might be the most intriguing team in 2009. Pomona appeared on the rise last season, raising the stakes for this year, but consider that the five teams they beat during a 5-1 start averaged 1.6 wins last year.\\nDue to a slightly deceiving 6-4 record in 2009, I think a lot of people expect coach Anthony Rice, who won a pair of CIF Central Division titles in four years at Colony, to step in a lead Pomona to its first playoff appearance since 2003. That’s a pretty tall order, especially considering he lost his best player a couple weeks ago when running back Taj Teague transferred to Claremont.\\n“It’s a work in progress,” Rice said. “We want to pick up where they left off last year when they took a solid leap forward. We want to work hard, add a little more discipline and focus on the little things to win games.”\\nBill Zernickow sounded practically as happy a few days ago as he did through the press box wall at Citrus College on Dec. 12 – only a little less muffled. Winning the first CIF championship in school history will do that to somebody, muchless if you defeat the No. 1 seed in a dramatic six-point, rain-soaked victory. “It’s something you can take to your grave,” Zernickow said.\\nFortunately for San Dimas, the Saints can probably afford to be a little fat and happy considering they return 14 starters from the team that went 13-1 in 2009. The entire offensive and defensive lines are back as are playmakers Jordan Taylor and Dillon Corona.\\nBut it’s not all gravy for San Dimas. One of those returning starters, junior quarterback Shawn Kennedy, is out until midseason with a shoulder injury suffered playing baseball. In Ryan Kohler and Tre Evans, the Saints graduated 2,374 rushing yards and 37 TDs.\\nAfter Pomona received a few incoming transfers from Colony this year, now the school is experiencing a significant one of the outgoing variety. Fred Robledo of the San Gabriel Valley Tribune got comfirmation from Pomona coach Anthony Rice that Pomona running back Taj Teague is transferring to Claremont, the school he attended as a freshman.\\nTeague, a 6-foot-1, 200-pound senior already with a few scholarship offers, could be the missing piece to a Claremont team with plenty of talent on offense everywhere except running back. Claremont was prepared to shift their best receiver, Tanner Kuramata, to tailback in obvious running situations before Teague’s transfer. Already with the best quarterback and one of the best receivers in the area in addition to a senior-laden offensive line, Claremont is loaded.\\nPomona will not challenge the transfer, according to Rice. “Let him play,” Rice said. “I don’t challenge anything, if he wants to go to Claremont so be it. I wish the kid the best of luck and hope he has a great senior year. You hate to lose a kid of that caliber, but it’s his choice.”\\nMVP: Derek Penilla, Senior, Pitcher, San Dimas\\nPitcher: Jason Martinez, Covina\\nPitcher: Eddie Pedroza, Northview\\nPitcher: willie Gomez, Ganesha\\nInfielder: Shawn Kennedy, San Dimas\\nInfielder: Nick Hynes, Covina\\nInfielder: Fernando Gonzalez, Baldwin Park\\nInfielder: Bobby Ramos, Northview\\nInland Division (no at-large entries)\\nBig VIII (4 entries)\\nNotes: The Baseline League essentially had four entries for the two seasons it was in the Inland Division, claiming the lone at-large berth each year.

These kids are in the same boat I was in when I was growing up and I want to turn this program back into what it used to be.”\\nUnlike when Rice was a record-setting running back at Garey High School, the Pomona Unified School district is saturated with new schools. The dispersed talent is the reason for Pomona football’s lack of recent success but the Red Devils have the talent to end their playoff drought, according to Rice.',\n",

       " {'text': 'Wednesday marks the 7th annual National Health Care Decisions Day. Amid setting up our spring wardrobe and stuffing our faces during Passover and Easter, today we are meant to take time and consider the importance of making health care choices before it’s too late. The creator of the national day of observance, health care attorney Nathan Kottkamp, believes that there is no better day than today to make important choices regarding our future health care.\\nNational Health Care Decisions Day was created to help educate the public about advance care planning. This is a three-step process that involves: considering the decisions that need to be made at the end of life, discussing one’s preference with family members, and recording those wishes in some form of advance directive. In the advanced care planning process, treatments to be considered involve both cardiopulmonary resuscitation and mechanical ventilation. Artificial nutrition, fluids, and comfort care are also factors that need to be taken into consideration. “Ninety percent of ethics consults I have been involved in deal with end-of-life decisions without advance directives,” Kottkamp told Reuters.\\nAlthough the ultimate outcome of considerations is a living will and durable power of attorney for health care, it is not the main objective. Kottkamp simply wants to get people talking about what their wishes are in the event that they fall seriously ill. “It has to start with the conversation,” Kottkamp explained to Reuters. “It can end with a piece of paper, but it’s the conversation that matters.”\\nA report by the California HealthCare Foundation found that if seriously ill, most people would want to speak with their doctor about end-of-life care. Based on a recent Reuters article, the report also found that less than 10 percent of those had this conversation. In individuals aged 65 and older, less than 13 percent already had this conversation. A survey by the Pew Research Center found that more than 42 percent of Americans have had a friend or relative suffer from a terminal illness or coma in the last five years. In most of these cases, the issue of withholding life-sustaining treatment had come up.\\nDr. Julie Goldstein, a palliative care physician in Illinois, believes that there are such low numbers of people discussing end-of-life health care issues because enhanced technology and medicine is giving unrealistic expectations of their ability to prolong life indefinitely. “I repeatedly see patients dying in the hospital while families stand by, engaged in wrenching decision-making without knowing what patients really would have wanted,” Goldstein added, in the Reuters article.\\nAlthough these conversations may be uncomfortable now, Kottkamp urges that they are even more uncomfortable in a hospital setting. In order to help observe the day, educational events are being planned nationwide. These events are taking place at libraries, hospitals, and other health facilities. Akron Children’s Hospital in Akron, Ohio, has advance directive forms available in the hospital’s public spaces to be signed and witnessed. The event had 25 participants last year and hopes to surpass this number today. “The worst time to talk about what you want is when you’re going through a health crisis,” Lisa Long, the hospital’s palliative care office coordinator told Reuters.',\n",

From pole to pole: The introduction to the series looks at our planet as a whole and considers the key factors that have shaped its natural history. Without fresh water there is no life on land, while the sun dominates the lives of all animals and plants on Earth and defines their habitats -- Mountains: This tour of our mightiest mountain ranges, starting with the birth of a mountain at one of the lowest place on Earth and ending at the summit of Everest, takes in some of the most reclusive creatures on the planet and reveals the secrets of their survival -- Fresh water: This episode follows the descent of rivers from their mountain sources to the sea and showcases the unique and dramatic wildlife found within Earth\\'s unexplored waters. Together the waterfalls, canyons, frozen lakes, wetlands and great rivers form a world of mystery, excitement and awe-inspiring sights--From container.\\nDisc 2. Caves: Deep in an undiscovered world, including both poisonous and flooded caves, we find astonishing crystals; cave angel fish; the five million bats of Deer Cave in Borneo and troglodytes - weird creatures, like the Texas salamander, that never see daylight nor set foot on the surface -- Deserts: Deserts, which make up a staggering 30 percent of the land\\'s surface, seem empty and lifeless, yet they are the most varied of our planet\\'s ecosystems. With remarkable footage Planet Earth unravels the secrets behind desert survival and for the first time on such scale, reveals the ephemeral nature of this dynamic environment -- Ice worlds: The advance and retreat of polar ice is the real challenge to life. As the sea freezes in Antarctica all animals flee, except for the Emperor Penguin. Meanwhile, in the Arctic, the polar bear is forced to swim vast distances and take on one of the deadliest adversaries on the planet ... --From container.\\nDisc 3. Great Plains: On these immense wildernesses, from the baking savannahs of Africa to the frozen tundra of the Arctic, we find the greatest gatherings of wildlife on Earth: but close on the heels of gazelles, caribou or wildebeest come an array of plains predators ... eagles, wolves and lions -- Jungles: With little seasonality and longer growing period, jungles are the most productive places on Earth, but surviving in the jungle is far from easy. Using state-of-the-art tracking shots and stunning aerials, Planet Earth moves along the dark forest floor, up through the layers of vegetation and across the canopy -- Shallow seas: Planet Earth follows a humpback whale mother and calf on an epic journey through the shallow seas of our planet. From tropical coral paradises, where the new-born calf takes his first faltering breaths, to the storm-ravaged icy polar seas, the whales\\' great feeding grounds, we reveal seas of great contrast and surprise.--From container.\\nDisc 4. Seasonal forests: From the evergreen forests of the frozen North to the deciduous dry forests of the tropics, these woodlands illustrate the intense seasonality of the Earth. The tallest, largest and oldest organisms on the planet, they are home to a fascinating range of wildlife -- Ocean deep: Feast or famine - it\\'s the governing principle of ocean life. From the sailfish, three-meter-long, rapier-billed predators, and the exquisitely shelled Nautilus to the threatened blue whale, this journey into the most unexplored part of the planet reveals the extraordinary survivors of this immense and barren realm.\\nDisc 5. Saving species: Many of the animals featured in Planet Earth are endangered so do we face an extinction crisis? Saving Species asks the experts if there really is a problem, looks at the reasons behind the declining numbers of particular animals and questions how we choose which species we want to conserve -- Into the wilderness: Pollution, climate change and a growing human population are all putting pressure on Earth\\'s wildernesses including the Bialowieza forest, the Gobi desert & the Arctic tundra. So how much of the planet is still wilderness? And why should we care? Into the Wilderness explores why these uninhabited expanses are important for our survival as well as that of all creatures on the planet -- Living Together: The history of conservation throws up some interesting ideas as we look to the future of an ever more populated planet. How can conservation fit into this new world driven by economics and development? Living Together looks at the challenges facing conservation in the 21st Century and looks at the role of religion in promoting a moral and ethical approach to the world we live in.\\n- Habitat (Ecology)\\n- Biotic communities.\\n- Cold regions.\\n- Desert ecology.\\n- Northern Hemisphere.\\n- Southern Hemisphere.\\n- Eastern Hemisphere.\\n- Western Hemisphere.\\n- Television programs -- Great Britain.\\n- Documentary television programs -- Great Britain.\\n- Feature films.\\n- Films for the hearing impaired.\\n- Documentary television programs.\\n- Television programs.\\n- Great Britain.',\n",

       " {'text': 'Competition body wants hackers prosecuted\\nJanuary 6, 2009\\nBy Linda Ensor (Business Day)\\nCAPE TOWN — The Competition Commission has laid criminal charges against the unknown hackers who lifted the lid on highly confidential information about the South African banking system that the four big banks wanted to keep under wraps.\\nThe charges had been laid in terms of the Electronic Communications and Transactions Act, the commission’s manager for strategy and stakeholder relations, Nandisile Mokoena, said yesterday.\\nThe confidential information is contained in the technical report of the inquiry into the banking system undertaken by the commission.\\nAn uncensored version of the report was posted on the Wikileaks.org website after hackers — believed to be based in SA — broke through the security measures put in place by the commission.\\nThe banks agreed to the public release of the report only on condition that strategic and sensitive information relating to their customer profiling, profit growth, pricing strategies, cost structures and revenue from penalty fees was blacked out.\\nThe commission gave this undertaking of confidentiality, which is legally binding in terms of the Competition Act.\\nOther data blacked out related to the breakdown of the credit card market and the fees earned from credit cards relative to their costs.\\nHowever, the secret information was decrypted (except for certain blacked-out sections which were resistant to “decensoring”) and posted on Wikileaks, which describes itself as a website for anonymous whistle-blowers. It is dedicated to leaking sensitive government, corporate and religious documents.\\nMokoena said Wikileaks had refused a request by the Competition Commission to remove the report from its website immediately. Commissioner Shan Ramburuth said in a letter to the website’s proprietors that the information obtained by Wikileaks was “obtained illegally under South African law”.\\nMokoena said the leak was a very serious violation of the commission’s confidentiality obligations and meant that it would have to strengthen its security arrangements.\\nShe did not believe a criminal prosecution was “hopeless”, saying the police would have to try to trace the hackers electronically.\\nThe Wikileaks website was launched in December 2006 by dissidents, journalists, mathematicians and technologists from the US, Taiwan, Europe, Australia and SA. It boasts a database of more than 1-million documents and recently made available a confidential briefing document relating to the collapse of the UK’s Northern Rock bank.\\nIt has also posted documents relating to corruption in Kenya, military expenditure in Afghanistan, operating procedures for the US army at the Guantanamo Bay detention centre, and a list of the 13500 supporters of the far right-wing British National Party.\\nAccording to reports on the internet, the Wikileaks website was shut down by a court injunction in California last year on the basis of an application brought on behalf of Swiss bank Julius Baer.\\nThis was after “several hundred\" documents were posted on the website about the bank’s alleged offshore activities, specifically money laundering and tax evasion at its Cayman Islands branch.\\nWikileaks slammed the court order as “unconstitutional\" and said that the site had been “forcibly censored\". The injunction was subsequently overturned and the bank dropped its case in March after the American Civil Liberties Union and the Electronic Frontier Foundation filed a motion protesting against the censorship of Wikileaks.\\nA coalition of US publishers and press organisations joined the application as a friend of the court on behalf of Wikileaks. US legal experts said the case highlighted the difficulty of enforcing national jurisdiction over a globalised internet.\\nFirst appeared in Business Day.

       " {'text': 'The focus of traditional PR still seems to be heavily on print and broadcast media, which are, as pointed out in the Social Media Today article, still the mediums with the biggest numbers. The article claimed that some 88% of newspaper reading time is in print and I’ve got no reason to doubt that figure.\\nHow much do numbers matter though? Surely effective marketing is all about who’s in the audience, not how big it is?\\nThe power of online is in the level of engagement. Done well, a brand’s online presence will have personality that’s much easier to convey on screen than in print. It’s much quicker (and cheaper) to build valuable relationships online; there are no print deadlines, no word limits, no editorial guidelines, no boundaries.\\nWhere will this leave traditional PR? Nowhere fabulous, I suspect. PR probably is still partying like it’s 1999 right now, but it’s very nearly time for the music to stop. For many small and switched on businesses, the return they’ll get from engaging with the world through the web will be much higher than sticking with old-school PR.\\nDigital Agencies are already elbowing PR aside, and within a couple of years, a traditional PR agency will be fairly niche. Times change, and in 2010 people will want to feel increasingly engaged with the brands and people they choose to do business with.\\nIn a world where your relationship with your customers and prospects is the single most important thing in your business, the arm’s length approach of using traditional PR will seem as outdated and as engaging as sending a fax.\\nRead the article that got me thinking here: http://bit.ly/2UVV8A',\n",

       " {'text': 'Internet Censorship Part Deux\\nWelcome to today’s edition of False Flag Terrorism (but this time… on the internet). It has been a while since I did my blog post on Internet Censorship, and some new developments have occurred since then. When we last left of, we discussed things like, the government planning to shut down certain sites in the case of a pandemic. We also talked about Internet Service Providers moving towards having restricted pay per view access to only a selection of corporate and news sites (and charging for any visits outside of these sites).\\nAs I stated in my previous post on this… the internet is the only place left where you can get unbiased information. The diabolical ones control all of the mainstream media. But they don’t control the internet. But they certainly are trying their best. And make no mistake; the battle over the internet will be Armageddon like, just for that reason.\\nNow of course, governments can’t just come out of the woodwork and say, “We want to take over and enslave the masses, so we are going to have to control and monitor the internet to find any freedom fighters, or anonymous “snitches” and snuff them out.” So they need to create an enemy in order to give them the legitimate excuse to do so. Just like 9/11.\\nMost people are against censoring the internet… but recent events may change that.\\nThis brings us to this point. If you haven’t heard, recently their have been a couple of bills that have come up that many believed to threaten internet freedom. These bills are SOPA and PIPA (Stop Online Piracy Act-HR 3261, and the Protect IP Act-S 968). These bills were supposedly designed to stop things like piracy online. But most people feel that these bills were really there as a disguise to censor the internet.\\nThe way these bills are written, any site with user content could be shut down (since you can shut down any website with one infringing link). It would be almost impossible to monitor your site under the new laws. And if a corporation wanted to shut you down, they could simply post an anonymous (copyright infringing) link on your site and you would be through.\\nWell ladies and gentlemen… “The People” made their voice heard! On the 18th of January, thousands of websites from all over the world all came out and protested SOPA and PIPA. The government received thousands of phone calls, e-mails and petitions, and many of them changed their stance on these bills. Obama then came out and said that he would not support the bill.\\nNow… I’m going to be honest with you. This whole thing seemed suspicious to me. Why? Well… first and foremost, Google and Wikipedia participated in this protest. Now ladies and gentlemen… Why would Google and Wikipedia participate in a protest against internet censorship when they are both in cahoots with the government and participate in censorship themselves?\\nSecondly, the government (or more specifically, the people who control them) is not stupid. The government knows how to boil the frog slow. So they aren’t going to pass a law on Monday, and shut down all of the conspiracy sites (+ YouTube and Facebook) on Tuesday. That would be too drastic of a measure, and they would be exposing themselves for doing to.\\nI have spoken many times on how the rulers of this matrix we live in are the dictators. So in order to keep from being overthrown, they give the masses a “political system” where they can “vote” to make them feel like they have a say in their destiny. Because if the people ever knew the truth, then there would be HELL to pay. I spoke on this in my Ron Paul article.\\nSo it’s important for their to be victories given to the people every once in a while so that they wont lose faith in “the system.”\\nLook… we were victorious. The political system works! Keep writing your congressmen! Keep protesting. It has been successful! Much celebration went on after this last victory… but something else after that happened.\\nOn the 19th of January, in response to the Department of Justice shutting down Megaupload (a file sharing website), a growing group of Hacktivists called Anonymous went on an attack! They shut down the servers of the following websites:\\n- Department of Justice (Justice.gov)\\n- Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA.org)\\n- Universal Music (UniversalMusic.com)\\n- Belgian Anti-Piracy Federation (Anti-piracy.be/nl/)\\n- Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA.org)\\n- Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI.gov)\\n- HADOPI law site (HADOPI.fr)\\n- U.S. Copyright Office (Copyright.gov)\\n- Universal Music France (UniversalMusic.fr)\\n- Senator Christopher Dodd (ChrisDodd.com)\\n- Vivendi France (Vivendi.fr)\\n- The White House (Whitehouse.gov)\\n- BMI (BMI.com)\\n- Warner Music Group (WMG.com)\\nAnonymous then claimed that they had access for all the following servers:\\n- Capital One\\n- Chase Bank\\n- US Bank\\n- United Nations\\n- Playstation Network\\n- Xbox Live\\nAnd if the government didn’t reinstate Megaupload in 72 hours, that they would shut down all of these servers to make a statement. They assured that they would not compromise anyone’s personal info (in the case of banks). There message to the people who support SOPA and PIPA is, “We are not f**king playing.“\\nOkay, now wait a minute. You are upset with the government for shutting down Megaupload… SO YOU SHUT DOWN YOUTUBE? Explain the logic behind that. Now, you may not have to get up early in the morning to fool me. But you do have to at least be up by 3-4 in the evening.\\nIt seems hard for me to believe that someone, something or some entity would have access to all of these servers (though I wont say it’s impossible), and even harder to believe that they would take it out on “the people” (who use Facebook, YouTube, Playstation.. etc), when this is supposed to be about protecting “the people” and their rights. They say that this is to demonstrate their power to those who doubted them… but the aforementioned attack already did so. It’s also hard to believe (the way that the government monitors the internet already) that a group of this many people could “unite” and cause all these problems.\\nThey are even openly giving instructions on how to participate. They say you can’t get caught if everyone executes this action at the same time… but since the government knows all the sites people go to… I would imagine they could make a list of whoever goes to the download link.\\nAlso, Anonymous was reportedly posting links on Twitter that would launch a DDOS attack against the government from that person’s computer without that person knowing, and according to John Kennedy of the Silicon Republic, even those users who didn’t know could be prosecuted and thrown in jail.\\nCould this be the boogieman terrorist that gives the U.S. Government the excuse it needs to more closely monitor the internet, shut down the internet… or better yet, “snuff out” those dissenters? Could the repercussions (people – some being innocent going to jail) scare the population into submission (even themselves asking for more “control” over the internet).\\nI mean after all, if they are shutting down whitehouse.gov, and victimizing innocent people, then all of us are in danger… right? This is a matter of National Security! We can’t let this anonymous internet terrorist threat on the internet take over our servers!\\nBut you know what? I could be wrong. I certainly have been before. Maybe their really is a freedom fighting underground group out there fighting for freedom. And maybe this latest plan (shutting down facebook) is someone (the government?) pretending to be Anonymous. Either way… it can play in the governments favor.\\nThis all remains to be seen. But right now… the next target of server crashing action is Facebook, 12:00am, January 28th. We shall see.\\nInternet Freedom Websites',\n",

       " {'text': 'Global Research Refuses\\nto Link to Serendipity\\nOn May 28, 2010, there was an attack on two mosques belonging to the Ahmadiyya Muslim Community in Lahore, Pakistan. The attackers opened fire with semi-automatic weapons and threw hand grenades at worshipers as they prayed, reportedly killing more than 79 people.\\nThe Ahmadiyya sect of Islam was mentioned in an article by David Livingstone, Globalists Created Wahhabi Terrorism to Destroy Islam and Justify a Global State, published on this website in August 2004, but most non-Muslims would never have heard of the Ahmadiyyas, so this news would cause some people to search the web for further information about them. I did so also, and came across this in Google:\\nClicking on this link leads to that page on Global Research\\'s site (archived here). This page, published (as it says) on July 19, 2006, credits \"Serendepity\" as the source of this article, and at the bottom has \"© Copyright David Livingstone, Serendepity, 2006\".\\nCuriously the editor of this page apparently misspelled \"Serendipity\" as \"Serendepity\", and even more curiously the link to \"Serendepity\" is given as \"serendepity.org\" not as \"serendipity.li\".\\nOn May 29, 2010, I sent the message below to Prof. Michel Chossudovsky, the editor of Global Research, via the given email address, email@example.com.\\nI received no reply.\\nDear Editor, I note that nearly four years ago you reprinted David Livingstone\\'s article \"Globalists created Wahhabi Terrorism to Destroy Islam and Justify a Global State\" http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&aid=2757 having picked this up from my website, Serendipity, http://www.serendipity.li/wot/livingstone.htm (this page went up on August 26, 2004). You acknowledge the source, but unfortunately you managed not only to misspell the name of my website (you wrote \"Serendepity\") but also to screw up the URL (you have \"http://serendepity.org/\"). Considering your usual careful attention to detail, I find this amazing! Please correct the name and the links on your page, both at the top and at the bottom, to: Serendipity http://www.serendipity.li Regards, Peter Meyer\\nOn May 29, 2010, I sent the same message to Prof. Michel Chossudovsky at his last known personal email address (with a cc to him at firstname.lastname@example.org). As at June 16 (and as at July 7) I had received no reply.\\nLet us examine this more closely. In 2006 Global Research discovered David Livingstone\\'s article on this website, and decided it was worth republishing on their own site, and did so (without informing me). Since the article was not contributed directly to Global Research by its author, they had to cite their source, which they did, as \"Serendepity\" and \"serendepity.org\". Were these \"mistakes\" deliberate? That this was a deliberate misrepresentation of the source of the article is suggested not only by the erroneous spelling twice, once in the name of the site and once in the URL (repeated at top and bottom of their page), but by the fact that, also, the top-level domain .li was changed to .org. There has never been a \"serendepity.org\".\\nIt appears likely that Global Research wanted to republish this article but did not want to link to the Serendipity website, and so deliberately misspelled the name of the site and substituted a false URL. And when, four years later, they were requested to fix this, they ignored the request.\\nNote added January 27, 2014: Upon noticing apparently sloppy editing of one of Richard K.

I was stunned to see some responses after three years of virtual radio silence by the Obama administration and the Congress, the very institution targeted by the “warning shot” from a lone wolf terrorist.\\nSenators heard testimony Tuesday from experts in biodefense and bio-preparedness — as well as current public officials. Context was provided by Dr. Robert Kadlec, who drew apt comparisons to the strategic threat posed by a sophisticated perpetrator.\\nThe bipartisan Center for the Prevention of Weapons of Mass Destruction, led by two former senators, has also sounded the alarm, with its report card last week for bio-preparedness.\\nYet, President Barack Obama still has no principal adviser on biodefense. The 2004 Homeland Security Presidential Directive on biodefense has been all but forgotten and has not been seen on the White House Website since January 2009. The National Security Council has been virtually silent.\\nCongress has the opportunity to examine and correct the way the strategic threat of biological warfare is “managed.” Current responsibility is fragmented among the Department of Homeland Security, the Department of Health and Human Services, the Agriculture Department , the Justice Department and the intelligence agencies.\\nThe problem is both structural and with leadership. Congress benefits from the fragmentation, since scores of committees can exert influence over the resources devoted to biodefense. This makes creation and implementation of a coherent strategy vulnerable to politics and lobbying by special interests, whose focus is cash and self-interest rather than the national interest.\\nOne example is the development of medical countermeasures against a biological attack. Congress has assigned this to an agency at HHS, the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority. But Congress did not create the structure necessary for an integrated acquisition system — from requirements through procurement.\\nCongress needs to take a fresh look as it prepares to reauthorize BARDA. We must have a system that starts with requirements based on threat and shepherds countermeasures through all phases of development, with multi-year money, leading to procurement commensurate with the risk to the population.\\nIn 2006, we sat around a table at HHS and a senior defense official pondered why we were not acting more quickly to take anthrax off the table as a threat. The only feasible approach is with a vaccine suitable for universal use – fewer side effects, fewer shots, suitable for children – that fits with the operational concepts of response to an attack.\\nFive years later, we still do not have it. Whether it is a failure of leadership, too much politics or a structure that doesn’t work, we cannot wait for many more anniversaries to get it right.\\nJeffrey Runge served as assistant secretary for health affairs and chief medical officer at the Department of Homeland Security.

       " {'text': 'ST. LOUIS, MO (KTVI) -Fellow Democrat and President of the St. Louis City Board of Aldermen Lewis Reed announced Wednesday he will challenge incumbent Mayor Francis Slay. The mayoral primary is the first Tuesday in March, 2013. Slay is seeking his fourth term in office.\\nReed promised a “shared vision” for the city that will help create a “world class city.” The former alderman from the Sixth Ward has been more critical of Mayor Slay in the last six months. As Board president, Reed is part of the three person revenue board that must approve city contracts, budgets and expenditures before they go before the aldermen.\\nReed complained he had asked the mayor to set up a fund to finance “hot spot” policing five months ago. “We went the entire summer without them because he refused to do it,” Reed said.\\nSlay’s office disputes Reed’s version of the story. Chief of Staff Jeff Rainford said Reed asked the budget director if the city could move one million dollars from the jail account to the police department but never sponsored a budget amendment to accomplish that.\\nRainford said the city police department tested hot spot or highly focused police patrols based on crime data from March to August in a partnership with UMSL. A report showed the effort produced about a thirty percent drop in crime. At that point, Rainford said Police Chief Dan Isom requested an extra $250,000 to pay for officer overtime to keep the program operating. The funds were taken from the jail account as Reed had suggested. Rainford said all three members of the Board of Estimate and Apportionment, Slay, Reed and city Comptroller Darlene Green voted for the fund transfer.\\nReed promised to assess the city “crime picture” if elected and to employ “new technology” to address problems.\\nMayor Slay said reducing crime has always been his administration’s number one priority. “Crime has actually gone down steadily. In fact we’re at a a forty year low,” Slay explained. But he agreed there is more work to be done. Slay promised St. Louis would continue testing new strategies to lower crime if he is re-elected.\\nFor more information go to the candidates’ web sites.\\nRelated Story: Lewis Reed To Challenge Slay For Mayor',\n",

JACKSON, Defendant-Appellant.\\nUnited States Court of Appeals,\\nArgued and Submitted May 6, 1996.\\nDecided May 28, 1996.\\nThomas M. Gannon, United States Department of Justice, Washington, DC, and Ronald W. Skibbie, Assistant United States Attorney, Spokane, Washington, for plaintiff-appellee.\\nBrian C. O\\'Brien, Dorn & O\\'Brien, Spokane, Washington, for defendant-appellant.\\nAppeal from the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Washington, Fred L. Van Sickle, District Judge, Presiding. D.C. No. CR-94-00284-FVS.\\nBefore: LAY,* WRIGHT and LEAVY, Circuit Judges.\\nEUGENE A. WRIGHT, Circuit Judge.\\nJackson was convicted of possession of cocaine base with intent to distribute and conspiracy to possess cocaine base with intent to distribute. On appeal he complains of several trial errors and argues that his sentence is unconstitutional. We affirm.\\nIn October 1994, the Spokane police orchestrated several drug transactions in which their confidential informant (\"CI\") bought crack cocaine from Steven Brown. On October 19, Brown\\'s girlfriend, Angela Brasch, dropped him off at a gas station for another transaction. The CI was expecting Brown to give him crack in exchange for a handgun, but Brown demurred, saying he had to replenish his drug supply. He offered instead to give the CI cash for the gun. They made the trade, then Brown was arrested. He told the police they could find Brasch at Tracy Nowacki\\'s apartment.\\nThe police found Brasch sitting with Jackson in Brown\\'s car outside Nowacki\\'s apartment. While the police watched, Jackson went into the apartment and came out again. After he returned, they searched the car and found a bag containing 4.3 grams of cocaine. They arrested Brasch and Jackson.\\nWith Nowacki\\'s consent, the police searched the apartment. They found 852 grams of crack cocaine behind the freezer compartment of her refrigerator. They also found a cell phone, a pager, a black bag containing $2,000 and a pager receipt in the name of John Davis (an alias Jackson used); $6,400 in a denim vest in the closet, and a digital scale.\\nBrown, Brasch and Jackson were indicted for conspiracy to possess cocaine base with intent to distribute and possession of cocaine base with intent to distribute. Brown and Brasch pleaded guilty and testified against Jackson.\\nAt trial, Nowacki testified that Jackson lived with her and her boyfriend Kenny Conway from time to time. He put a bag of crack cocaine in her refrigerator in December, 1993. He and Conway (who was Jackson\\'s cousin and was in jail at the time of Jackson\\'s arrest) regularly took drugs from the refrigerator, weighed them and bagged them. Nowacki drove Jackson to several drug transactions while he stayed with her. He had a key to the apartment and came by regularly to pick up crack. Even when he was not sleeping at her apartment, he kept drugs there, along with the black bag in which the police found the money and pager receipt. She also testified that on October 19, just before his arrest, Jackson came to her apartment and got something out of the refrigerator.\\nBrasch testified that she dated Jackson from January to March, 1994. When they broke up, she took some of his belongings, including five ounces of crack. She said that when Jackson learned of the theft, he threatened to kill her or members of her family unless she sold drugs for him to work off her debt. She made several sales between March and October. She told the jury that on the day of their arrest she was meeting Jackson to pick up a quarter-ounce of cocaine for Steve Brown.\\nJackson testified at trial. He claimed to have no knowledge of the cocaine in Nowacki\\'s refrigerator. He said he was meeting with Brasch, who was pregnant, to discuss arrangements for their unborn child.\\nJackson was convicted of conspiracy to possess 4.3 grams of cocaine base with intent to distribute, and of possession of 856.3 grams with intent to distribute. He was sentenced to 188 months.\\nI. \"Immunized Witness\" Instruction\\nNowacki was never arrested in connection with the cocaine found in her apartment. In return for her cooperation, the government paid her $700 for relocation expenses. The court was prepared to instruct the jury that, because Nowacki received \"compensation\" from the government, it should \"examine Miss Nowacki\\'s testimony with greater caution than that of ordinary witnesses.\"\\nThe defense argued that in addition to paying her, the government implicitly immunized Nowacki, promising that she would not be prosecuted if she testified that the drugs belonged to Jackson. Defense counsel suggested an instruction that would identify Nowacki as an immunized witness and caution the jury to examine her testimony with greater care and consider her motive to falsify.\\nThe court found that there was no evidence in the record that Nowacki had been immunized. The judge agreed, over government objection, to replace the word \"compensation\" in the instructions with the word \"benefits\" so as to \"allow both of you to argue your theories of the case.\" Jackson argues that this instruction was insufficient to permit him to present his theory that Nowacki was effectively immunized and had a motive to implicate him.1\\n\"It is settled law that a defendant is entitled to have the judge instruct the jury on his theory of the case, provided that it is supported by law and has some foundation in the evidence.\" United States v. Sarno, 73 F.3d 1470, 1485 (9th Cir.1995) (quotations omitted). We review for abuse of discretion the district court\\'s \"determination of the factual basis for a requested instruction,\" as well as the \"form in which the court has expressed the defendant\\'s theory of the case.\" Id.\\nThis record reveals no evidence that Nowacki was immunized, and we therefore find no error in the court\\'s instruction. Contrary to Jackson\\'s argument, the word \"benefits\" gave his implicit immunity theory the weight it deserved.2II. Prosecutorial Vouching\\nJackson contends that the prosecutor vouched for Nowacki\\'s credibility in his closing argument. Because there was no objection to his comments, we review for plain error. We reverse only if the error is plain, affects substantial rights, and \"seriously affects the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" Olano, 507 U.S. at 736, 113 S.Ct. at 1779 (quotation and alteration omitted).\\n\"As a general rule, a prosecutor may not express his ... belief in the credibility of government witnesses. Vouching consists of placing the prestige of the government behind a witness through personal assurances of the witness\\'s veracity, or suggesting that information not presented to the jury supports the witness\\'s testimony.\" United States v. Necoechea, 986 F.2d 1273, 1276 (9th Cir.1993) (citations omitted). But the prosecutor must have \"reasonable latitude in fashioning closing arguments,\" and can make reasonable inferences based on the evidence. Id.\\nJackson points to two incidents of vouching. In one, the prosecutor told jurors, \"I imagine the police officers would have been a little bit upset if it was found out later that Miss Nowacki had been lying to them [about ownership of the cocaine].\" This was not vouching. It was a reasonable inference from the evidence. The police had questioned Nowacki and relied on her account. The prosecutor gave no personal assurance that she was telling the truth and never suggested that the police would be able to determine whether she lied. Cf. United States v. Roberts, 618 F.2d 530, 533 (9th Cir.1980) (improper for prosecutor to tell jury that police were monitoring the trial to determine that witness testified truthfully); United States v. Shaw, 829 F.2d 714, 717 (9th Cir.1987) (finding vouching where prosecutor implied that he would be able to determine whether witness was testifying truthfully).\\nThe prosecutor also told jurors that \"[t]here was no benefit of lack of incarceration to Ms. Nowacki in this case. She\\'s not guilty of a crime.\" He argued that she did not possess the cocaine under the legal definition of \"possession\" laid out in the jury instructions.\\nEven if we were to hold that these comments were vouching, we would not reverse because they did not \"seriously affect[ ] the fairness, integrity or public reputation of judicial proceedings.\" Olano, 507 U.S. at 736, 113 S.Ct. at 1779. In deciding whether to reverse for vouching, we consider the form of the statement, the degree of personal opinion asserted, the seriousness of the vouching, the timing, the importance of the witness and the vouching to the case, the extent to which the witness\\'s credibility was attacked and any curative instructions. Necoechea, 986 F.2d at 1278. Few of these factors favor Jackson.\\nThe prosecutor\\'s remarks were an invited response to the defense\\'s attempt to paint Nowacki as an uncharged accomplice. United States v. de Cruz, 82 F.3d 856, 863 (9th Cir.1996) (holding prosecutor\\'s improper rebuttal argument to be harmless in part because it was an invited response). There was abundant evidence against Jackson, and although Nowacki was an important witness, her testimony was corroborated in most respects by physical evidence and by Brasch. The jury was instructed to view her testimony with caution and was told that the arguments of counsel were not evidence. There was no plain error in allowing this argument.\\nIII. Evidence of Other Acts\\nJackson moved the court to prohibit any mention of his alleged membership in the Crips gang, his prior arrest for cocaine possession at a notorious nightclub and any prior drug sales. After hearing argument, the court ruled that his gang membership and prior arrest could not be mentioned but that incidents of prior drug sales could be admitted \"as [they] relate[ ] to issues concerning [the conspiracy count] in this matter.\"\\nJackson contends that the district court abused its discretion by admitting this evidence. He argues that the evidence was inadmissible under Federal Rules of Evidence 404(b) and 403. We review for abuse of discretion the court\\'s decision to admit this evidence, but we consider de novo whether evidence is directly relevant to the crime charged or relevant only to \"other crimes.\" United States v. Santiago, 46 F.3d 885, 888 (9th Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 115 S.Ct. 2617, 132 L.Ed.2d 860 (1995).\\nUnder Rule 404(b), evidence of \"other crimes, wrongs, or acts is not admissible to prove the character of a person in order to show action in conformity therewith.\" Fed.R.Evid. 404(b). It may, however, be admitted for other purposes, including \"proof of motive, opportunity, intent, preparation, plan, knowledge, identity or absence of mistake or accident.\" Id. Rule 404(b) \"is a rule of inclusion.\" United States v. Meling, 47 F.3d 1546, 1557 (9th Cir.1995) (quotation omitted). Unless the evidence of other crimes tends only to prove propensity, it is admissible. United States v. Ayers, 924 F.2d 1468, 1473 (9th Cir.1991); see also Meling, 47 F.3d at 1557 (\"[E]vidence is admissible under Rule 404(b) if it is relevant to an issue in the case other than [the] defendant\\'s criminal propensity\"). We must consider several factors to determine if Rule 404(b) permits admission, such as whether the evidence proves a material element of the offense charged, whether it is similar to the offense charged, whether there is sufficient evidence of the prior conduct and temporal proximity. United States v. Basinger, 60 F.3d 1400, 1408 (9th Cir.1995).\\nThe disputed evidence satisfies these requirements. The government introduced evidence only of similar drug transactions that involved drugs stored in Nowacki\\'s refrigerator, or that involved Jackson and the coconspirators. This evidence tended to prove the material elements of knowledge and intent. It also proved opportunity, plan and preparation. It served to link the coconspirators and explain their criminal relationship. Jackson does not contend that there was insufficient evidence of the prior conduct. Finally, the court admitted prior acts from only a limited time period.3\\nJackson also contends that the evidence of prior drug transactions violated Rule 403 and that the court never engaged in an explicit Rule 403 analysis. See Meling, 47 F.3d at 1557 (\"Evidence admissible under Rule 404(b) may nevertheless be excludable under Rule 403 if its prejudicial impact outweighs its probative value.\"). The district court, however, is not required to recite Rule 403 for the record. United States v. Ono, 918 F.2d 1462, 1465 (9th Cir.1990). \"It is enough that this court can conclude, based on a review of the record, that the district court considered Rule 403\\'s requirements.\" Id. Here, immediately before the court\\'s initial decision to admit the evidence, Jackson\\'s counsel argued repeatedly that it was unduly prejudicial. We find that the court \"implicitly made the necessary finding.\" United States v. Ramirez-Jiminez, 967 F.2d 1321, 1326 (9th Cir.1992) (finding implicitly made where trial brief reminded judge that probative value and unfair prejudice must be balanced); see also Ono, 918 F.2d at 1465. There was no error.4\\nIV. Cocaine and Cocaine Base\\nSection 841(b)(1)(A) prescribes a 10-year minimum penalty for any person convicted of possession with intent to distribute\\n(ii) 5 kilograms or more of a mixture or substance containing a detectable amount of--\\n... (II) cocaine, its salts, optical and geometric isomers, and salts of isomers; ...\\n(IV) any compound, mixture, or preparation which contains any quantity of any of the substances referred to in subclauses (I) through (III); ...\\n(iii) 50 grams or more of a mixture or substance described in clause (ii) which contains cocaine base....\\n21 U.S.C. § 841(b). Jackson was sentenced under subsection (iii) for possession of cocaine base.\\nAt his sentencing hearing, Jackson presented expert testimony that a substance containing \"cocaine\" necessarily contains \"cocaine base.\" He also submitted evidence from the record of United States v. Davis, 864 F.Supp. 1303 (N.D.Ga.1994). In that case, the district court, presented with expert testimony that cocaine and cocaine base were synonymous, held that section 841(b) provides two different penalties for the same offense. It applied the rule of lenity and sentenced the defendant under the provisions for \"cocaine\" rather than \"cocaine base.\" Id. at 1309.\\nJackson argues that we should follow Davis. We decline to do so, as have the other circuit courts that have faced this issue. See, e.g., United States v. Booker, 70 F.3d 488, 489-91 (7th Cir.1995), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 1334, 134 L.Ed.2d 484 (1996); United States v. Jackson, 64 F.3d 1213, 1219-20 (8th Cir.1995), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 966, 133 L.Ed.2d 887 (1996); United States v. Fisher, 58 F.3d 96, 98-100 (4th Cir.), cert. denied, --- U.S. ----, 116 S.Ct. 329, 133 L.Ed.2d 229 (1995).\\nThe government does not dispute Jackson\\'s argument on scientific grounds. It concedes that, to a chemist, cocaine and cocaine base are the same substance.5 But it counters that the two terms are not \"legislatively synonymous,\" and that Congress intended the term \"cocaine base\" to denote the smokable form of cocaine.\\nUnited States v. Shaw, 936 F.2d 412, 414-16 (9th Cir.1991), supports this position. In that case, the defendants argued that they could not be sentenced under the \"cocaine base\" provisions because the government had not proven that the cocaine they possessed contained a hydroxylion. A hydroxylion is a necessary component of a \"base,\" as that term is used in chemistry. We held that the term \"cocaine base\" is not limited to substances that test basic rather than acidic. Looking to the legislative history of section 841(b), we found that Congress intended \"cocaine base\" to refer to \"cocaine that can be smoked, unlike cocaine hydrochloride.\" Id. at 416. We held that as long as cocaine and cocaine base, as those terms were understood by Congress, are \"objectively distinguishable,\" the statute is not vague. Id.\\nShaw implies that the distinction between cocaine and cocaine base may be a practical one and not a scientific one: we are not bound to construe the statute as if it were a chemistry text.6 Shaw also provides a workable distinction between \"cocaine\" and \"cocaine base\" as those terms are used in the statute: \"cocaine base\" is the form of the drug that is intended to be smoked. As the Seventh Circuit remarked in Booker, \"Congress intended \\'cocaine base\\' to mean crack.\" 70 F.3d at 493. By crack, the 1986 Congress meant \"a new, smokable form of cocaine that was more dangerous than powder cocaine, less expensive and highly addictive.\" Id.7\\nJackson argues that this court should not look to the legislative history to resolve any ambiguity in a criminal statute. See United States v. R.L.C., 503 U.S. 291, 308, 112 S.Ct. 1329, 1339-40, 117 L.Ed.2d 559 (1992) (Scalia, J., concurring) (arguing that legislative history cannot clarify an ambiguous criminal statute). But the rule of lenity applies only if \" \\'reasonable doubt persists even after resort to the language, structure, legislative history and motivating policies of the statute.\\' \" Id. at 305-06, 112 S.Ct. at 1336 (plurality opinion) (quoting Moskal v. United States, 498 U.S. 103, 108, 111 S.Ct. 461, 465, 112 L.Ed.2d 449 (1990)). The Supreme Court has not rejected the use of legislative history in this context, and Ninth Circuit precedent makes use of it to define \"cocaine base.\" See Shaw, 936 F.2d at 415-16.8\\nSection 841(b) draws a sufficient legal distinction between \"cocaine\" and \"cocaine base.\" We need not resort to the rule of lenity.\\nV. Rationality of Sentencing Disparity\\nJackson argues that the 100:1 ratio in the sentencing provisions for crack and powder cocaine offenses violates the Equal Protection Clause. He acknowledges that we have already rejected this argument. See United States v. Harding, 971 F.2d 410, 413 (9th Cir.1992), cert. denied, 506 U.S. 1070, 113 S.Ct. 1025, 122 L.Ed.2d 170 (1993). He contends that the rational basis for the 100:1 ratio has eroded because the Sentencing Commission, after some study, recently recommended that the disparity be eliminated. Congress disapproved its recommendation. Pub.L. No. 104-38, 109 Stat. 334 (1995).9\\nWe do not agree that the Commission\\'s report, or Congress\\'s decision to reject it, affects the precedential value of our ruling that Congress had a rational basis for the 100:1 ratio. Several members of the committee dissented from the recommendation to eliminate the sentencing disparity. They argued that, although the differential was too high, there are good reasons to treat crack differently from powder cocaine, including the quicker and higher \"highs\" from crack, the youth of its users and sellers, the low per-dose cost that leads to easy distribution and the violence associated with distribution of the drug. These reasons are essentially those that have been attributed to Congress\\'s initial decision to enact the 100:1 ratio. See Harding, 971 F.2d at 413-14. That decision was rational, even though it differs from the Sentencing Commission\\'s current recommendation regarding the magnitude of the disparity. Id.; accord, Booker, 70 F.3d at 494 n. 24.10\\nWe affirm. There were no trial errors requiring reversal. We find no ambiguity in section 841(b) that would require resort to the rule of lenity and there is still a rational basis for the 100:1 cocaine base/cocaine sentencing disparity.\\nHonorable Donald P. Lay, Senior United States Circuit Judge for the Eighth Circuit, sitting by designation\\nThe instruction given was: \"You have heard testimony that Tracy Nowacki, a witness, has received benefits from the government in connection with this case. In evaluating her testimony, you should consider the extent to which it may have been influenced by the receipt of benefits from the government. You should examine Miss Nowacki\\'s testimony with greater caution than that of ordinary witnesses. Although it is ultimately up to you to decide how much weight her testimony deserves.\"\\nJackson also argues that Nowacki was an accomplice, and that the jury should have been instructed to view her testimony with caution for that reason. Because the accomplice argument was not raised at trial, we review for plain error. Fed.R.Crim.P. 52(b). The cautionary instruction the court gave with respect to Nowacki\\'s testimony is nearly the same as the one it gave regarding Jackson\\'s charged accomplices, Brasch and Brown, and Jackson\\'s counsel was free to argue that Nowacki was an accomplice. We find no error that could have \"affected the outcome of the District Court proceedings.\" United States v. Olano, 507 U.S. 725, 734, 113 S.Ct. 1770, 1778, 123 L.Ed.2d 508 (1993)\\nJackson argues that the court did not give an adequate limiting instruction. Although he never requested an instruction at trial, the court sua sponte told the jurors that they must \"consider the evidence in the case for only those purposes for which it has been admitted\" and cautioned that they must \"[r]emember that the defendant is on trial only for the crimes charged. Not for anything else.\" Jackson referred specifically to the judge\\'s instructions in his closing argument. In these circumstances, the instruction was sufficient\\nJackson argues that the court should have excluded evidence of a trip he and Brasch made to buy drugs in California. We do not determine whether the court properly admitted this evidence because any error was harmless in light of the strength of the government\\'s case\\nThe Seventh Circuit, confronted with similar expert testimony, explained in detail the scientific basis for the defendant\\'s argument. Booker, 70 F.3d at 489-91\\nJackson argues that Shaw is not controlling because it was based on the scientifically incorrect premise that cocaine hydrochloride contains no cocaine base. We do not address this question because we draw from Shaw no conclusion about the chemical composition of cocaine and cocaine base. Rather, we follow only Shaw \\'s holding that the \"correct definition of cocaine base ... as a matter of statutory interpretation\" is grounded in congressional intent, and not in chemistry. Of course, the statute must adequately convey this intent so that it provides fair notice of what conduct is prohibited. Papachristou v. Jacksonville, 405 U.S. 156, 162, 92 S.Ct. 839, 843, 31 L.Ed.2d 110 (1972). Jackson does not argue that the statute failed to give such notice\\nThere was expert testimony that cocaine hydrochloride is technically smokable. But the expert made clear that it is not intended to be smoked, and that, \"if given a choice, no one would smoke cocaine hydrochloride because it would burn their nostrils and is very caustic and very little of that would get in their system.\"\\nWe note that it may be unnecessary to consult the legislative history. At least one other court has concluded that section 841(b) is not ambiguous without relying on it. In United States v. Fisher, 58 F.3d 96, 99 (4th Cir.1995), the Fourth Circuit employed the canon of statutory construction that a court should \"give meaning to all statutory provisions and seek an interpretation that permits us to read them with consistency.\" It reasoned that clause (ii), which prescribes the penalty for cocaine must necessarily exclude cocaine base, because clause (iii), which gives heavier penalties for cocaine base, would otherwise be rendered superfluous. Because the court found the statute to be unambiguous, it found there was no need to look to the legislative history. Id\\nAlthough Congress rebuffed the Commission\\'s suggestion that the disparity be eliminated entirely, it did request that the Commission study the matter further and recommend a sentencing ratio of less than 100:1 but more than 1:1. This directive indicates that Congress may at a later time consider changing the sentencing structure, but it does not affect our decision that there is a rational basis for the 100:1 ratio\\nJackson also argues that because the sentencing disparity has a disparate impact on African-Americans, the court should apply \"active\" or \"biting\" rational basis scrutiny. This novel suggestion is foreclosed by United States v. Dumas, 64 F.3d 1427, 1430-32 (9th Cir.1995) (applying rational basis review where defendant could not make out case of racially discriminatory intent in enactment or application of section 841)',\n",

       " {'text': 'Around the globe, public transportation administrators and operators are facing up to the challenges created by the impact of increasing congestion; capacity and budget constraints; aging infrastructure and workers; and increasing competition.\\nThe volume of activity in the sector has reached unprecedented heights across the world. In the United States, transportation infrastructure includes nearly 151,000 route-miles of bus service and more than 7,000 miles of fixed rail transit. The European Union made 60 billion public transit trips in 2008, which equates to 120 public transportation trips each year for every person. In Asia, the Tokyo Metro, the world\\'s busiest subway, hosts 8.7 million riders every day and more than 3 billion passenger rides annually.\\nGiven these current financial, social and environmental realities, the public transportation industry is faced with the challenge to find new efficiencies to allow for transformational improvements. In order for public transportation authorities to provide quality, reliable, convenient and safe service, they need to gain full transparency around the different functional operations groups within an organization. This operations transparency (OT) requires managing rolling stock, infrastructure, facilities and equipment with more transparency and accountability than ever. This situation is exacerbated by two often contradictory and competing influences: rider expectations and limited resources.\\nThis landscape faces several fundamental challenges:\\n- Infrastructure: The poor condition of this key area of transport needs significant investment to maintain a state of good repair\\n- Operations: Companies are increasingly managing shrinking budgets at a time when they must meet or exceed service reliability and quality\\n- Demand: Increasing urban population has a direct impact on capacity and service quality\\n- Fuel Costs: Rising fuel costs continue to impact bottom line at a time when organizations are seeing more demand for public transportation\\n- Cost Optimization: Many are seeking ways to extend vehicle life to rethinking capital improvement initiatives\\n- Sustainability: A focus on green transit is an increasing priority but implies higher maintenance costs\\n- Security: The pressure and scrutiny to meet safety and security requirements is only increasing\\nOperations Transparency: Taking visibility to the next level\\nThe nature of today\\'s public transportation industry makes the need for OT clear. Technology plays a critical role in optimizing visibility and efficiency to create ever-increasing levels of service execution in public transit. It requires managing operations through improved integration of service execution systems (SES), enterprise asset management (EAM) and enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems — putting technology at the core of this approach. OT uses real-time integrated data collection and analysis for unprecedented visibility into daily transit operations for higher levels of decision support.\\nSuccessful OT requires knowing what management information to collect, how, and where to do so to ensure a holistic view. This is in stark contrast to what most public transit operators have today. The value of OT is not simply in having a new view of operations. Rather, it is in how transit administrators and operators act on data to drive whole-life optimal asset management. By doing this, they can make improvements that can help revolutionize public transportation for administrators, operators, workers and riders alike.\\nIt does this by providing full, real-time, contextual visibility across service execution management, resource and asset management, and the ability to integrate with other interfaces so administrators and operators can gain actionable insight to drive business outcomes. The key to smart decision-making is coordination and collaboration across multiple departments enabled by integrated processes, tools, as well as technologies.\\nA true, cross-enterprise view of operations through OT is important when transforming today\\'s transit challenges into competitive advantages. With a true vision of the current state, public transportation authorities can make strategic, efficient and cost-effective inroads to an improved future state.\\nMoving forward: OT steps for success\\nSuccess requires a fundamental shift in how transit authorities think about managing operations. They must move from what needs to be done, to a high-level view that accounts for organizational interdependencies and overarching business goals.\\nOperators must overlay their focus on tasks, actions, and who will do them — with analysis that drills down to understand and probe causes and effects. It is a new focus on relational data over transactional data — a shift from reactive to proactive decision making. OT helps transit organizations to:\\n- Analyze transactional data in real-time in its original context to achieve new visibility\\n- Make informed operational decisions among field and back office managers\\n- Drive predictive whole life management of all operations assets to maximize value\\n- Enhance personnel productivity and efficiency\\n- Break down information silos that exist across departments and business units\\n- Reduce technology integration cost of ownership\\n- Enable new insights into cross-fleet integration\\n- Support long-term planning and capital expansion\\nMany public transportation organizations have laid the groundwork for OT through their existing investment in SES, EAM and ERP systems. However, to improve customer satisfaction and on-time performance, transit authorities must implement an OT framework to realize the full value of their investment.\\nThere are several elements that should be in place for public transit authorities to move toward OT:\\n1. Awareness of the interdependent data necessary for operations visibility\\nIt is vital that organizations identify all the operations data that needs to be collected and/or integrated together to provide the right visibility leading to the right decisions.\\n2. The essential foundation for OT is the right data\\nData collection in a proper technological framework can prove challenging. Often, operations and the data that goes with it are disconnected. Organizations need both an awareness of what data to assess and a means of consolidating this data. An operations data collection framework can capture, manage and analyze data.\\nMany transit authorities rely on multiple systems to store different types of operations data. What\\'s needed is a single EAM operations platform leveraged to its fullest and integrated with an ERP platform.\\n3. Standardization of processes, procedures, management practices and controls\\nOT represents a very different way of working for public transit authorities. The data and the collection framework are only as good as the processes that establish and clarify how operators can most effectively act on data insights.\\n4. A cultural change at every level of the public transportation organization\\nAlthough it is easy to take for granted, the human element of the OT transformation is central to its lasting success. Historically, the industry has not had access to this kind of technology. Now that it is available, the challenge is to help workers break old habits when new systems are put in place so organizations can gain the most value from their technology investment. Furthermore, the organization-wide transition from a \"seat of the pants,\" incident-based management style to a data-driven, predictive one will require a keen and comprehensive change management focus.\\nMany transit companies have one or many of the above mentioned technologies in place and are making efforts to progress in each of the four elements described above. However, the high performers will be those that embrace the concepts and technologies to transform themselves on the way to supporting a customer centric business based around smarter infrastructure.\\nRajesh Ramamurthi, firstname.lastname@example.org, is an OT architect with Accenture and Scott Tvaroh, email@example.com, is a global EAM lead with Accenture.',\n",

Specifically, fifty percent (50%) of those who read it said that it either changed their thinking about long-term care or they took some kind of action as a result of reading it. We expect the December supplement to have the same – if not greater – impact. We are committed to educating consumers about this important issue and look forward to growing this effort with the AALTCI in 2012.”\\nFull-page advertisements from John Hancock Life Insurance Company (U.S.A.) and The Prudential Insurance Company of America are running as part of the supplement, which will be included in the December issue of the publication. The December issue will reach more than 2.5 million readers and will be available on newsstands on November 8.\\nIn addition, Kiplinger’s will promote long-term care awareness on the publication’s website, www.kiplinger.com. The American Association for Long-Term Care Insurance has posted the two prior guides focusing on long term care insurance costs on the organization’s website.\\nLEARN MORE ABOUT LONG-TERM CARE INSURANCE PROTECTION.

       " {'text': 'I have recently been in contact with an ex Holbay employee (1959 - 1963) in my quest for information on period Formula Junior heads. He advised the following :\\n\"I worked for Holbay 1959 to 1963. During that period I have no recollection of Ford supplying special heads. We used to buy complete 105E engines from Ford and strip them down. We retained the standard block (bored out) and standard head castings with extensively re-worked ports with with larger valves\".\\nIt appears from this that at least in the period up to 1963 Holbay developed Ford race engines from new stock they obtained from Ford.\\nhatrat, do you reckon your ex Holbay contact is mates with any ex Holbay fellows from 63 to 66,67 or thereabouts?\\nThe reason I\\'m harping on is that now I\\'m intrigued to learn to what extent Holbay used 105E blocks in conjunction with 116E/120E blocks when the five bearing ones became available. Or, did they cease using three bearing blocks at the end of the FJ era (or at some later stage and move soley to five bearing ones)? I\\'m working from a very small sample from 1965, but Dad\\'s S65 and the R65 (dinky di F3 997cc engine in the article PS30-SB turned up) both apparently 1965 vintage engines, both definitely employed five bearing blocks, one small bore, the other large bore. I suppose it depends what type of racing engines (or, rather, how many racing types) they were trying to cover. I keep forgetting to take account of saloon car racing when thinking about these things........\\nFor their Sports Racing S65 engine, they had a 105E head, downdrafted, on the 120E block, I suspect, 1) because they could with SRC rules/regs & 2) cause an Anglia head allowed for little combustion chambers on a small capacity engine that therefore allowed them to get the compression ratio they needed.\\nSo, a bit more scratching around has revealed another period commentary on Ford\\'s engines of the period, this time in Autocar, 7 January, 1966 where Sports Editor, Peter Garnier on page 37 in his \"The Sport\" column. It doesn\\'t shed any light on what block types Holbay were using, but it does give Holbay a bit of a chuck on the shoulder and feeds my bias in their favour!!!\\n\"British Saloon car Championship , ...being run to Group 5, works supported teams of Cortinas and Anglias will take part. In the 1000cc class two Anglias entered by Broadspeed, with engines modified by Cosworth, will be driven by John Fitzpatrick and Peter Procter. In the up to 1300cc class, two 1200 cc Anglias, prepared by John Young of Superspeed Conversions, will be driven by Mike Young and Chris Craft.\\nTeam Lotus, with Jim Clark, Jack Sears and Peter Arundell, will run two Group 5 Cortina Lotuses in the Championship races. Because Group 5 allows so many more modifications - in fact you can do pretty well anything you like provided you don\\'t increase the capacity above the top limit of the class into which the engine originally fell, and don\\'t change the camshaft(s) position - the engines will be specially prepared by BRM. They will have dry sump lubrication, and a new Lucas fuel injection system......\\nAdded to all this, there are Ford\\'s formula 2 and 3 acivities. Dominating formula 2 since its early beginnings, the Cosworth Type SCA engine, based on the Ford 1500cc, 5-main bearing block, is now producing more power since it has been fitted with fuel injection ( the Edward Eves article, Cosworth SCA 65 in Autocar 16 April 1965 has customer engines equipment as two Weber 40 DCM2 carburettors with 32 mm chokes) and is being used by several of the main contenders during 1966......\\nIn formula 3, Holbay and Cosworth prepared Ford units have swept the board.\\nFinally, Ford say that Cosworth Engineering, in conjunction with Ford of Britain, are well advanced with their programme for a new formula 2 unit (for the new formula 2) as well as the formula 1 engine recently announced....\" (and we all know where those two power plants went).\\nAnyway, the point of my reproduction of all that is that it\\'s nice to see Holbay mentioned in their \"niche\" in the same breath as the colossus of Cosworth on an equal footing as far as F3 is concerned. Peter Garnier\\'s point was that Ford rate the publicity of competition success very highly and pity the fact that other manufacurers didn\\'t feel the same way............\\nMakes me wonder in these engines, how big an issue bearing drag was/is versus valve train integrity/valve spring rates/breathing in general and whether or not Holbay spent just many, or many, many hours on different camshaft variations......\\nIs Laurence \\'Slim\\' Coe still with us?\\nIf your Holbay contact was prepared to comment on the blocks and even the Anglia head on five bearing block theory I\\'d be all ears!!!\\nEdited by SJ Lambert, 27 September 2010 - 12:49.',\n",

       " {'text': \"Aurinia Pharmaceuticals Initiates Phase 2b Clinical Trial of Voclosporin to Treat Lupus Nephritis\\nVICTORIA, BRITISH COLUMBIA–June 26, 2014– Aurinia Pharmaceuticals, Inc., (TSX: AUP) today announced enrollment of the first patient in its planned Phase 2b clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of voclosporin as a treatment for lupus nephritis (LN). LN is an inflammation of the kidneys, that if inadequately treated can lead to end-stage renal disease, making LN a serious and potentially life-threatening condition. The Lupus Foundation of America believes there are as many as 1.5 million people in the U.S. with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), approximately 40 to 70 percent of whom will develop LN.\\nThe Phase 2b trial, called AURA–LV (Aurinia Urine protein Reduction in Active Lupus with voclosporin) or AURA, is planned to be conducted in approximately 20 countries and is a randomized, controlled, double-blind study comparing the efficacy of voclosporin against placebo in achieving remission in patients with active LN. The AURA study is designed to demonstrate that voclosporin can induce a rapid and sustained reduction of proteinuria in the presence of extremely low steroid exposure and to fulfill specific regulatory requests. It will compare two dosage groups of voclosporin (23.7mg and 39.5mg) administered with mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) vs. MMF alone. All patients will also receive oral corticosteroids as background therapy. There will be a primary analysis to determine complete remission at week 24 and various secondary analyses at week 48 which include biomarkers and markers of non-renal SLE. The Company expects patient recruitment to be completed within approximately 12 months.\\n“We aim to advance our development of voclosporin to treat lupus nephritis given the significant unmet need, lack of approved therapies and market opportunity,” said Stephen Zaruby, President and CEO of Aurinia. “ The immunology of LN, along with significant published data, support the use of a multi-targeted treatment approach for this debilitating and heterogeneous disease.”\\nVoclosporin is a novel calcineurin inhibitor (CNI) with extensive clinical data in over 2,600 patients in other indications. Voclosporin is made by a modification of a single amino acid of the cyclosporine molecule (a CNI approved for use in transplant patients since 1983). This modification results in a more predictable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic relationship, an increase in potency vs. cyclosporine, an altered metabolic profile, and potential for flat dosing. These attributes have the potential to position voclosporin as a best in class CNI inhibitor.\\nAurinia is a clinical stage pharmaceutical company focused on the global nephrology market. Its lead drug, voclosporin, is a novel CNI. Aurinia holds global rights to all indications for voclosporin and has development and commercialization partners in Canada, Israel, South Africa and Greater China.

       " {'text': 'It was a good night for American hockey and a better night for the Dallas Stars.\\nMike Modano scored two goals to equal and then set a new record for career points by an American-born player to help lead the Stars to a 3-1 victory over the San Jose Sharks at HP Pavilion Wednesday night.\\nThe win, the Stars’ second straight on the road after losing three in a row at home, also enabled them to leapfrog over the Sharks into first place in the Pacific Division. It was also the Stars’ fourth consecutive triumph in San Jose, dating back to last season.\\nFor Modano, netting two goals in the first five minutes of the contest was a sweet way to finally attain the record he’s been chasing all season. After going pointless the last three games, Modano looked sharp early and collected his 83rd career game-winner.\\n“It’s a great relief, a lot of weight off the shoulders, finally take a deep breath and enjoy it a little bit,” Modano said. “I kept telling myself to relax, play my game and try to enjoy it. Tonight couldn’t have been written up any better.”\\n“They were both good goals and everyone in the organization couldn’t be happier for him,” Stars coach Dave Tippett said. “It’s been phenomenal what he’s meant to hockey in the United States and he has done this with so much class. I know he was getting frustrated but the most important thing was to keep playing his game and good things happened.”\\nOn the other side of the ice, San Jose’s Jeremy Roenick, third on both the American goals and points lists, entered the night with 499 career goals. Although he did earn an assist, Roenick was unable to pick up his big milestone goal, but had nothing but good things to say about Modano, his friend and frequent teammate on U.S. national teams in several Olympics and World Cup tournaments.\\n“It was spectacular. He did his job and got his end of the bargain done, now it’s my job to get one,” Roenick said. “I’m so proud of Mike Modano, he’s been an idol of mine for a long time. I really think he’s the greatest player ever to come out of America, and not only that, one of the greatest players ever to play the game, and I’ve really been fortunate to play against him for many years, play with him on the Olympic team and you can’t say enough about what he’s done for the game, what he’s done for the Dallas Stars and what he’s done for American hockey.”\\nOne game after notching his first shutout of the season in Anaheim Monday, goaltender Marty Turco was simply outstanding for the Stars, turning aside 38 shots, including several brilliant stops that had the Sharks shaking their heads. On any other night, Turco would have been the major story of the game.\\nDespite being outshot 39-12, the Stars delivered a solid, gritty, all-around performance.\\nBut the spotlight belonged to Modano, who struggled at times earlier this season with the weight of the record on his shoulders, but he looked like vintage Mo.\\n“It was finally the last (record) of the bunch, it was something I was looking to at the start of the year to accomplish and get it over with, but it definitely means the most,” Modano said. “Certainly, a lot of guys you thank, coaches and people in the organization, (former owner) Norm Green, Tom Hicks, the whole crew, coaches past and present, and players along the way who’ve certainly helped out in that. You’re thankful you’ve been in the game this long, you appreciate it more certainly as you’ve gotten older and maybe the wait has forced me to appreciate it more.”\\nLeading 2-1 heading into the second, the Stars increased the lead to two just 2:12 into the period on Ott’s first goal of the season. He received a nice lead pass from Todd Fedoruk at the San Jose blue line and sped in on a breakaway. He made a slick deke to his backhand, much like Modano did on his second goal earlier in the game, and slid it through Sharks netminder Evgeni Nabokov’s pads for the 3-1 lead.\\nNabokov did make a big save on Jere Lehtinen’s slap shot from the left face-off circle midway through the period to keep it a two-goal game.\\nThe Stars then got a big break when it appeared that San Jose veteran Sandis Ozolinsh, who was playing in just his third game after signing as a free agent last Friday, had scored on a power play, but the goal was waved off. As Ozolinsh collected a rebound in the left circle, Milan Michalek fell back into Turco, knocking him over just as Ozolinsh’s wrist shot sailed past him and in. That prompted the officials to nullify the goal, because of the ‘incidental contact’ with the goaltender that prevented him from being able to even attempt to stop the puck.\\nTurco continued to shine in the final period, as the Stars were outshot 14-2, but managed to protect their two-goal lead. First, with the Sharks on a power play, Turco turned aside Alexei Semenov’s blast from the left circle about a minute and a half into the third, then seconds later, denied Steve Bernier’s shot from the slot.\\nOn the same San Jose power play 45 seconds later, Turco robbed Jonathan Cheechoo, turning aside his wrist shot from the left circle.\\nJust over four minutes into the period, Turco made a big kick save on Michalek’s scorching wrist shot off the rush from the left circle kept the Stars’ lead at two, then stopped another wrister from Cheechoo 20 seconds after that. The Sharks held a 9-0 edge in shots in the period after five minutes.\\nModano had a prime opportunity to pick up his first hat trick in over eight years midway through the third period, but his one-timer attempt from the slot hardly went anywhere after his stick snapped in half as he shot.\\nPerhaps his best stop of the night came with just 2:53 remaining as he slid across the crease and managed to get his pad on Ozolinsh’s one-timer from the left circle after a sweet cross-ice pass from Michalek, who led all skaters with eight shots in the game.\\nThe Sharks pulled Nabokov with 1:50 to go, and then enjoyed a power play for the final 1:12 after captain Brenden Morrow was whistled for slashing, essentially giving San Jose a 6-on-4 advantage, but the Stars did an excellent job of clearing the zone and not allowing any more prime opportunities.\\nTurco started the game off extremely well and kept the Stars in it early as he stopped an immediate barrage of San Jose shots in the first two-plus minutes.\\nPatrick Marleau ripped a quick wrist shot from the left circle just 10 seconds after the opening face-off and Turco’s big save set the tone. He made another nice stop on Cheechoo 30 seconds later, then turned aside Michalek’s wrist shot from the slot through a screen 1:55 in.\\nAnother 10 seconds later, perhaps Turco’s best save of the Sharks’ initial push came off of Mike Grier’s one-timer from the slot that he corralled in his glove.\\nAt that point, San Jose was outshooting the Stars 5-0 and Dallas had yet to get the puck into the Sharks’ zone. But then Modano broke out of the zone on a counter-attack after accepting a lead pass from Sergei Zubov and then he launched a booming slap shot from the top of the left circle that zoomed past Nabokov’s glove at 2:19 to tie the record.\\n“I was surprised I had so much time,” Modano said. “There was fresh ice and I had a long look at it. I waited to get it on net and I was fortunate to put it past him.”\\nAfter the accomplishment was announced inside the arena, the 17,496 in attendance at the ‘Shark Tank,’ their 32nd consecutive sellout, classily gave Modano a standing ovation.\\nThe Sharks continued their offensive pressure immediately after the goal, and Turco made another big save 30 seconds later, sliding out to stop Patrick Rissmiller’s shot to finish off a 2-on-1 break.\\nThen, about four minutes into the first, with San Jose on a power play, Turco made another impressive save on Michalek’s in-close deflection of Joe Thornton’s wrist shot. At that juncture of the contest, the Sharks actually held a 10-1 edge in shots, but amazingly, the Stars still had the lead.\\nModano would increase the lead to two at 4:24 with San Jose still on the power play. Lehtinen helped him poke the puck away from Shark defenseman Matt Carle at the Dallas blue line, allowing Modano to take off on a breakaway. As he approached the net, he appeared to momentarily lose control of the puck, then regained it and slipped it between Nabokov’s pads for the 511th goal and milestone 1,233rd point of his outstanding career.\\n“It was a great play by Lehtinen and set it up and it’s fitting that guys like Zubie and Jere set up the goals tonight,” Modano said. “I’ve played with those guys a long time and it means a lot that they were involved.”\\nAgain, the public address announcer noted the achievement and the stunned San Jose fans, who were watching their club dominate the Stars territorially and outshoot them 10-2 but still trailed 2-0, gave another standing ovation.\\n“I’ve always enjoyed playing in San Jose,” Modano said. “They’ve been a classy organization, (San Jose General Manager) Doug Wilson and Ron (Wilson, Sharks coach), who have been good friends and good people to talk to as I’ve gotten older and as I’ve matured through the league, but it was a classy act on their part.”\\n“I’m really proud of the way the San Jose Sharks really gave him a good ovation,” Roenick added. “Here, it was really nice that they stopped the game for a bit, I’m really proud of them.”\\nAbout three minutes later, the Stars were enjoying a power play of their own, and missed a golden opportunity to go up by three when they were awarded a penalty shot. After Nabokov stopped Modano’s slap shot from the blue line, Mike Ribeiro took the puck behind the net and Nabokov accidentally threw his stick at him. Tippett could have chosen any Dallas player on the ice to take it and selected Zubov, but Nabokov deftly poke-checked the puck off Zubov’s stick as he prepared to make his move.\\nTurco continued to put on a show at the other end, thwarting Marcel Goc’s wrist shot off the rush just before the midway point of the first, then dodged a bullet seconds later when Goc’s wrister from the slot rang off the post.\\nWith 1:25 to go in the period and the Sharks on a rare 4-on-3 power play, Turco made a sparkling sliding save on Joe Pavelski’s one-timer from the left circle.\\nBut it was just seconds later that San Jose finally broke through and got one past Turco - on their 18th shot of the period. Carle controlled the puck at the right point, skated into the right circle, and then launched a wicked wrister that beat Turco to the far side with 1:13 remaining.\\nOverall for the period, San Jose outshot the Stars 18-6.\\n“I think we we’re lucky to come away with a one-goal lead the way they came at us, but they’re a great team in their home building,” Modano said of the first period. “We were fortunate to be one up.”\\nThe Stars make their way to down to Phoenix Thursday night (8 pm, my27) to play the Coyotes in the third of four straight road games against divisional opponents. The Stars finish up the trip in Los Angeles Saturday night (9:30 pm, my27)\\n- Ott’s goal was his first in about 19 months, as he last found the net on April 18, 2006 against Columbus. Of course, since he was injured for much of last season, that only comes out to a drought of 38 games, including playoffs.\\n- Defenseman Mattias Norstrom left the game about five minutes into the first period with facial cuts, forcing the other Dallas defenseman into more ice time than usual. While Norstrom lasted just three shifts for 2:32, Zubov logged an incredible 31:32, more than half the game.\\n- Lehtinen’s assist on Modano’s milestone goal marked the 97th time Lehtinen earned an assist on a Modano goal, more than any other player. Zubov is second on that list, and his assist on the first goal was his 59th on a Mo goal.\\n- Modano’s second goal was also the Stars’ fourth shorthander of the season, which ranks second in the NHL and gives them more than they had all of last season. It was Modano’s 29th career shorthanded goal, which of course, is also a franchise record.\\n- Modano led the Stars in shots on goal for the second straight game, firing three on Nabokov.\\n- Turco earned an assist on Ott’s goal, marking the second consecutive game he’s picked one up. That was his 12th career assist, moving him past former North Star Jon Casey for the franchise all-time lead in goaltender assists.\\n- Turco was called for a delay of game penalty for the second straight game, for handling the puck outside the trapezoid area behind the net.\\n- Despite allowing one power play goal, the Stars were 7-for-8 on the penalty kill, and have now nullified 33 of their last 35 man-disadvantages.\\n- This was game eight of a 10-out-of-11 stretch where the Stars play teams in the Pacific Division. Now they are 4-4-0 in those contests.\\n- The Stars plan on having a special tribute to Modano for setting the record at their home game against Anaheim on Nov. 21 (the day before Thanksgiving), so plan on being there!\\n1 - 0 DAL\\n2 - 0 DAL\\n2 - 1 DAL\\n3 - 1 DAL\\nHi stick - double minor\\nDelaying Game-Ill. play goalie',\n",

You keep reading over and over again, title after title, Take Surveys and Get Paid! It’s so easy! While these sites are tempting to sign up to, more often than not, you’ll find yourself in a pile of bad and untrusted survey sites which will end up, let’s face it clogging up your inbox if you sign up without reading a little first. While the ‘take surveys and get paid’ methodology may seem peachy on the surface, there’s a few things you should know about Paid Surveys before you begin.\\nTake Surveys And Get Paid. It is that easy, but there are some things you should know..\\n1. Yes you will take surveys, yes you will get paid and yes it will be easy but…\\nDon’t expect flowing wealth over night. If you’re an experienced survey panelist and there’s one thing you’ve discovered, it’s that surveys take time. If you’re trying to find the ‘get paid the next day survey’, it’s a fairytale and you should probably stop looking now because you’re more likely to run into a big fat scam rather than a unicorn. Just like any other job, online or not, Market Research Companies need time to process and verify the surveys you’ve taken and the payments which are owed to you. If you’re expecting payments the next day, you’re probably better looking elsewhere.\\n2. You may find it hard initially to find a survey panel that works for you…but don’t give up they are out there!\\nNot many sites will tell you this but, the truth is, not every survey panel is going to suit you. You may not like their surveys, they may not be targeting your demographic at this moment, you might find yourself not qualifying for surveys very often. Whatever it may be, in most cases not every survey panel you sign up for is going to suit. In saying that, you shouldn’t give up, there are paid surveys for almost everyone! This is why it is a good idea to sign up to many panels at once rather than one by one. You can learn more about why this will help you make more money from surveys here.\\n3. Yes it’s easy to take surveys and get paid but don’t expect to be a millionaire…\\nIf you’re thinking you’re going to be able to pay the bills with your survey money or you’re on a site promising you hundreds of dollars a week, it’s probably time to come back to reality. Surveys are a fantastic way of earning extra cash to put towards a holiday, a special outing or perhaps a gift, but you can’t expect to be making a living off surveys.',\n",

       " {'text': \"Discussion: (0 comments)\\nThere are no comments available.\\n| Daily Standard\\nChina's Ruling Party Is Stoking the Fires of Nationalism\\nIn 2002, the movie Hero became an instant hit in China, where it was made by Zhang Yimou, perhaps the best-known Chinese director. When it opened in America last year–complete with an above-the-title imprimatur by haute auteur Quentin Tarantino–it was billed as an action-romance of the Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon variety, complete with wire-guided swordfights and a melodramatic ménage-a-trois love angle. Yet, in addition to being a piece of post-modern eye candy, the film had a distinctly pre-modern theme: the glories of Chinese nationalism. The movie’s central plot swirls around martial arts master Jet Li’s decision to abandon his mission to kill the Qin emperor, who is marching his army to conquer Jet Li’s homeland of Zhao. The hero recognizes that the establishment of “our land”–greater, imperial China–is a cause far greater than the enslavement of his native people. As New York Times film critic Manohla Dargis (a student of the Maureen Dowd school) summed up Hero‘s message: “Roll over, Chairman Mao, and tell the comrades the news: the history of the empire now comes wrapped in kaleidoscopic kung fu cool.”\\nUnquestionably, nationalism is intended to be cool in China these days. Indeed it has become the replacement for communist ideology as the Chinese Communist party seeks to maintain its hold on power while embracing capitalist economics. The government is ritualistic in its fanning of the flames of this nationalism–the “spontaneous” anti-Japanese protests in Chinese cities on the first three weekends of April bore the unmistakable marks of Beijing’s stage management. As student protestor Sun Wei told Joseph Kahn of the New York Times, “I felt like a puppet.” The rally in Beijing ended when police told the crowds they had “vented their anger” long enough, shuffled them on to busses back to their campus. “It was partly a real protest and partly a political show,” Sun declared.\\nThe protests began in the city of Chengdu, in southwest China, April 2, but when they hit Beijing a week later they grew in size and seriousness; they were the biggest to take place in China since 1999, when huge crowds expressed their anger over the inadvertent bombing of China’s embassy in Belgrade during the war in Kosovo. That the demonstrations continued into a third weekend is a measure both of the depth of Chinese anti-Japan sentiment and the level of official tolerance of such feelings. In Beijing, units of police and interior ministry troops were mobilized as protection for the Japanese embassy and the Japanese ambassador’s residence, but they didn’t prevent the crowds from throwing stones and bottles, or from looting Japanese businesses.\\nThe roots of China’s anti-Japanese anger are deep, based not just on the events of the World War II era but also the earlier flowering of Japanese power at the turn of the 20th century. Their devastating defeat in the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895 is widely regarded in China as a watershed event marking China’s weakness before imperial powers, leading even intellectuals to fear national extinction. As J.A.G. Roberts writes:\\nThe disastrous defeat in the Sino-Japanese War destroyed the credit of the self-strengtheners [in China] and raised acute fears for the nation’s survival. In the aftermath, in response to the scramble for China, a determination to preserve all practical means to preserve China may be observed. . . . From these incidents and from the social changes which occurred in the late nineteenth century, there developed the sentiment which may properly be called Chinese nationalism.\\nFurther, the Chinese Communist party bases much of its claims of legitimacy–and its dispute of Guomindang legitimacy–on its record of fighting the Japanese invasions of the 1930s and 1940s. As the Economist succinctly puts it in its explanation of the recent protests: “Animosity towards Japan is regarded as the hallmark of a [Chinese] patriot.”\\nIt also appears that anti-Japanese sentiment is a particularly useful tool for Beijing in its drive to assert both a global and a regional leadership role. For example, reminding East Asians of Japanese atrocities during World War II is an effective tool amongst Koreans. The visits of Japanese Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi to Yasukuni, the Shinto shrine to Japan’s war dead, have been pilloried as honoring “war criminals.” The immediate spark for the latest demonstrations in China was the publication in Japan of an allegedly revisionist textbook playing down the atrocities, which also plays into the Beijing line that Japan has not sufficiently apologized for its past. Moreover, Japan’s emerging new role as a “normal” geopolitical power and its renewed alliance with the United States–based in great measure upon fear of rising Chinese military power–and calls to make Tokyo a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council have focused the Chinese regime’s interest in stoking anti-Japanese feelings.\\nFinally, it’s almost certain that Chinese leaders are attempting to siphon a whole host of social troubles–economic and labor unrest, internal political repression, corruption, and the general lack of political development–into expressions of anger at Japan and other foreign sources. Murray Scot Tanner, a senior political scientist at RAND Corporation and perhaps the leading authority on rising unrest in China, observes:\\nChina has taken a much riskier step beyond its emerging protest strategy of “permissive containment and management” by trying to tacitly “stage manage” angry young nationalist protestors. The leadership clearly hopes to ride this wave, buttress its popular nationalist credentials, and mobilize this popular anger as a diplomatic tool in its dealings with Japan over such issues as textbooks, Security Council membership, and cooperation with the U.S. to protect Taiwan. China can now claim–probably correctly–that its people would not stand for significant concessions on these issues.\\nBut Beijing has chosen to run major risks that could end up creating serious challenges for its domestic stability and its foreign policy. By aligning itself with the protestors (not withstanding its public calls for restraint), it risks having its policies boxed in or manipulated by protestor demands. . . . Perhaps worse, if Beijing finds it must use coercion to limit the protestors, it risks putting its security forces in the dangerous position of being seen as the “protectors” of the “unrepentant Japanese”–a very dangerous situation for a government that has staked its claims to legitimacy on nationalism and economic growth.\\nBut Chinese nationalism sees many devils other than the Japanese. Indeed, beginning with the Opium War of the 1840, there began what Sinologists call a “victimization narrative,” essentially a chronicle of Western exploitation of–and contribution to–Chinese military and political weakness. Naturally, this victimization narrative contrasts Chinese nationalism with Western imperialism, and often–with the Boxer Uprising of 1900 taken as the mythic prototype–calls forth a peasant movement in response. This also serves to link the narrative of modern Chinese history with the dynastic cycles of the more distant past. Thus the late Qing period is described as China’s “century of humiliations,” with the strong implication being that this pattern has been broken by the rise of the Communist party to power and now, with China’s emergence as a regional and global power.\\nTo today’s Chinese nationalists, the United States stands as the ultimate Western hegemon and practitioner of, in the government’s favorite phrase, “power politics” aimed at blocking Beijing’s rightful place in the international order. However, in this view, the narrative of the 21st century will have quite a different outcome than that of the 19th century: In their 1996 screed Surpassing the USA, authors Xi Yongjun and Ma Zaithun declare that “China’s rise is the sign for America’s fall.” This is the strong belief of the so-called “fourth generation” of Chinese Communist party leaders, the generation of Hu Jintao, who, “because of the education they have received, in their subconscious the West, and the U.S. in particular, has always been our enemy, oppressing us, invading our motherland; and even killing our countrymen.”\\nThe character and virulence of modern Chinese nationalism goes a long way toward explaining Beijing’s response to the crisis over the mid-air collision between a Chinese fighter and a U.S. Navy EP-3 reconnaissance aircraft in early 2001. Although it was almost immediately clear that the incident resulted from overly aggressive tactics on the part of the Chinese pilot and a fatal error on his part, there seemed to be no way that the Beijing government could admit the facts, especially to its own people, and thus bring the crisis to resolution. Viewed as an element in the narrative of Chinese nationalists, the crash of the Chinese MiG and the death of the pilot were evidence of continuing attempts by the United States to humiliate China, consequently a hostile response was the only palatable option for the government in Beijing. Such are the dangers to the leadership of “riding the tiger,” as Murray Scot Tanner puts it, of Chinese nationalism.\\nIn theory, the phenomenon of nationalism, the love of one’s country, or patriotism, is neither good nor evil. At the core of American “nationalism” is the narrative of the Declaration of Independence–a document often targeted by Chinese nationalists as indicative of the immaturity of American culture–with its enunciation of natural, universal political rights. Even “Chinese” nationalism, as now expressed in Taiwan, can be energetically, even brawlingly, democratic.\\nYet modern Chinese mainlander nationalism is marked by a number of darker qualities, as Yu Maochun of the U.S. Naval Academy argues. It is deeply chauvinistic, celebrating not only millennia of Chinese civilization but the virtues of the Han people. And it is an important staple of Chinese popular culture–or at least that popular culture endorsed and promoted by the government. Observes Yu:\\n[I]nternalized chauvinism in China’s popular culture remains pervasive among ordinary Chinese citizens. The Chinese government in its vigorous campaign of “Patriotic Education” strongly endorses “patriotic songs” that blatantly advocate chauvinism. Earlier this year, the [Party] authorities in Shanghai endorsed three such songs for all high schools in the region. One of them is called “The Chinese,” by the pop star Liu Dehua. The lyric defines what qualifies one as a “Chinese,” [that is,] one must have “yellow face and black eyes.” . . . Perhaps the most popular “patriotic song” in the last 25 years in China is Zhang Mingmin’s “Dragon’s Descendents,” which defines a Chinese as someone with “black eyes, black hair, and yellow skin.” The latest “patriotic song” performed at every major national TV event is Ye Fan’s “Dear China, I Love You!,” which goes even further by claiming that “my yellow skin is china’s national flag.”\\nIt’s important to note that there are alternative interpretations of Chinese tradition that would make for a less disturbing form of nationalism. The assimilative notion of “Sinicization” for centuries turned Tibetans, Mongols, Turkic peoples, Muslims, Buddhists, Koreans, and others into Chinese; in this narrative of Chinese history, acculturation was a means to civilize the barbarians. Thus conquerors became dynasts; outsiders were integrated into Chinese politics.\\nBut that’s not the kind of nationalism that appeals to the leadership in Beijing today. Thus the notion of China’s “peaceful rise,” so appealing to Western Sinologists, is difficult to square with the chip-on-the-shoulder attitudes that percolate under the banner of modern Chinese nationalism. Thus Yu Maochun’s review of Zhang Yimou’s movie Hero is much darker than that of the New York Times. The “biopic,” as he calls it, of emperor Shi Huangdi, who militarily “unified” China in 221 B.C., is more than kaleidoscopic kung fu cool. It’s also is a thinly veiled argument for an attack on Taiwan as well as an expression of an aggressive nationalism. “Through stunning cinematography, the movie reminds” Yu of Leni Reifenstahl’s Triumph of the Will, in which Hitler and National Socialism are equated with German nationalism. Hero‘s message “is unmistakable–no matter how brutal a dictator might be, no matter how many people he might have to murder, as long as he could unify China by any means, he is China’s hero.”\\nWhether or not Hu Jintao imagines himself as such a hero is impossible to know. But in promulgating such a model of heroism in service to an imperial ideal, the Chinese Communist leaders are riding a very powerful tiger, notorious through history for slipping the leash.\\nTom Donnelly is a resident fellow at AEI.\\nThere are no comments available.\\n1150 17th Street, N.W.

       " {'text': \"In these days of mega-dollar Pro Touring Camaros, it's actually refreshing to see a ride that's built on a real workingman's budget. Eric Earney's 1967 Chevy Camaro is just such a car. His idea was to wrench together a ride that was more about having fun than trying to impress others by wielding the latest unobtanium billet widget or mega-horsepower engine. The result is a Camaro that handles great, stops quickly, and flies down the dragstrip. Eric did the lion's share of the work himself, including the paint, interior, and the retrolicious black-vinyl top. For motivation, the first-gen fields a 5.7L LS1 with a fourth-gen Camaro drive system. Compared to the competition, it puts out a relatively mild 340 horsepower, but on drag radials it's enough to knock down a best e.t. of 11.83 sec. at 113 mph. Backing up the aluminum mill is a 700-R4 built by Transmissions To Go. The front suspension received a stack of parts from RideTech while the rear was treated with a complete Detroit Speed QUADRALink system. A quick-ratio box allows for quicker course corrections, and Turn One massaged the power steering pump. Four-wheel GM disc brakes reside inside the 18x9.5 and 18x11 Budnik wheels while Falken tires provide the lateral grip.\\nEric has owned his classic Camaro for over 20 years, but his favorite memories are from more recent times: autocrossing with his two daughters, Hailey and Cammie. The car is part of their family and was even the ride of choice on his wedding day. It just goes to show that a Camaro is much more than just the sum of its parts.\",\n",

       " {'text': \"Creating a Round roof\\nI'm sure you know that you can create a round roof, either as a complete circle or as part of an overall roof. When you select a round roof, each arc will be an edge with 2 end points and a mid point even though you may appear to have many hips. You can change the appearance for the smoothness of the curve (& number of hips) by editing the edge (Selecting the Right Roof Object and Right Click option) and increasing or reducing the number of segments (max 30) to represent the curve. Whilst 30 may look the smoothest in real terms, a round roof is built with a number of segments (hips) so you may be best to match the contruction number for an accurate representation.\\nThere doesn't appear to be any way to create a curved roof using the command line but you can create one by applying the Roof tool to curved linework or walls. Note that ;\\n- You cannot create a completely round roof from a circle linework or 2 Arcs so use 2 arc'd wall objects (2 arcs - because you can't create a completely circular wall with one wall either!).\\n- You possibly can't create a roof with a round portion from linework unless it's a closed polyline. (Well that's how I had to do it).\\nYou can also create curved roofs in the vertical plane for barrel vaults, eyebrows and igloos. You can't create a smooth curve but can add multiple changes in pitch to approximate the curve which again is how they are generally constructed in real life. Now the effort to add these multiple pitch changes is no small task so you would like to know how the resultant estimate 'curve' will look before you begin to ensure you are going to be happy with it. Also you need to be able to enter exactly each pitch and height changes to get the appearance of a constant curve not spend all day guessing at the numbers? So how?\\nWell I have a simple idea to give you the exact data to be entered in the roof edge to get exactly the result you were expecting.\\nDraw your Arc in elevation view as it would appear adjacent with the model. Use the DIVIDE command to place Points around the Arc. Use an even number to land one point at the apex if you drew the whole Arc (I only drew half!). . Draw a PolyLine on a different layer joining the Points and then turn the other layers off. You should now be left with the Polyline stepping around your curve and be able to estimate whether you are happy with the resulting estimation of the curve. (This will be on your aecElevations as well as any rendered model.) If not - erase the points and use the divide command again increasing the points if you want a smoother curve. Once satisfied, you can dimension each point by angle and height as shown above and this will give you the numbers you enter into an edge on your roof object. OR... you could simply draw a polygon instead of the PLine and have your segments a lot quicker! Again adjust the number of sides until you are happy and then use the procedure above to measure each point to enter into your RO. He's pointed out this is also useful for Roman & Gothic arches. Thanks for sharing this cool tip Robert. As James points out, you can also attach an edge profile to an aecSlab to create the curve. Your slab would be a very narrow ridge at the apex and the curved profile both sides would give you your round roof. You can trim slabs with a pline to fit it into your main roof.\\nTIP: Be aware the height numbers are for a roof object with it's elevation at 0. If you need to adjust for a different baseline of your roof object, stretch all your dimensions (not the angle ones) down or up at once if necessary to add/delete any extra required.\\nWith this technique, you can create an Eyebrow roof out of a normal gable roof as illustrated, or a barrel vault roof or your own special creation etc.\\nThere is a limitation of the roof object shown here for the eyebrow roof. The Roof object thickness stays perpendicular to the main roof pitch and does not dynamically adjust with the changes in pitch as shown in the picture. For me this would be covered by a gable end treatment (Structural object) but would also be evident in any section. (Note that Sergej's updated Spirit roof tool has no problem with keeping the roof thickness constant!)\\nYou can also create a Concave or Convex (bullnose) curve to your roof though I may use a wall style for these (see here and here). The other option as James has shared is to add a profile to a slab object so the slab itself is only a very small postion and the curve is achieved with the profile. Very easy to do if your roof line is constant.\\nCopy & paste Trick (sergej's tip)\\nIf you are looking at doing multiple pitches to more than one edge with the ACA Roof Object as shown above, it can get tedious real quick entering each height and pitch on a number of edges. However once you have entered a series to one edge, if you click in the first column of the face box and Control C to copy, you can then move to another edge and paste the same numbers (yes all three columns). If you had originally selected the 2nd (or more) edge already, it will be available in the dialogue box to paste to. Ok it's not perfect. Be nice to be able to alter a number of edges at once but it's quicker than doing each edge individually. Oh and it is a little temperamental sometimes and may need caressing to get the paste to overwrite.\\n- When you create a roof object, it remembers the last pitch for next time but not the last edge cut. (I think it writes it to the registry!)\\n- Once you edit some of the edges, adding gables etc, you may not be able to edit the main pitch via the properties pallete and may need to edit each edge at a time! Sigh! Therefore it may be quicker to remove a pitch (gable?) adjustment, change the roof pitch and then re-enter the gable.\",\n",

       " {'text': 'Today’s announced partnership between the West Coast innovators Square and Starbucks represents a significant milestone in the advancement of mobile payment and digital wallets. Here’s why:\\nNew entrant scale. The Pay With Square digital wallet has suddenly catapulted from a respectable new entrant in mobile payments, driving adoption within the long-tail of retail, to soon being present in every Starbucks, and in NYC, that’s just about every other block. Starbucks, the leader of in-store mobile payments, says that 1 million people per week use its mobile payment app to pay in-store. Its existing mobile payment customers will now be Square’s customers, giving Square an immediate boost in the number of locations and consumers it reaches within the market.\\nAccelerated adoption. As with the Starbucks app, consumers have only to download the Pay With Square wallet and load their funding source in order to use it. But unlike the existing Starbucks app, the Square digital wallet works with other merchants. According to Square, merchant acceptance is very quick and no-to-low cost, and Square promotes its participating merchants to users of the wallet. I think this set of factors will motivate other merchants — both large and small — to use this as an opportunity to trial mobile payments in their stores. Today’s announcement is unclear about whether the initial implementation will have Starbucks embedded in the Pay With Square wallet, but at a minimum, this deal gives Square broader visibility and awareness and the opportunity to earn the confidence of new customers with its digital wallet, which will drive broader adoption overall.',\n",
